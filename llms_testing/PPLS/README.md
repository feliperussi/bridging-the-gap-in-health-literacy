# PPLS Folder

The `PPLS` folder contains resources and scripts for generating and evaluating Protocol Plain Language Summaries (PPLS) using GPT-4 and GPT-3.5. This folder includes the ground truth texts, the generated texts, and a notebook for evaluating the generated texts using BERTScore and other metrics.

## Folder Structure

- `ground_truth/`: Contains the original ground truth texts used for comparison.
- `output_gpt4/`: Contains the PPLS generated by GPT-4.
- `output_gpt35/`: Contains the PPLS generated by GPT-3.5.
- `Clinical Trials_Test_Dataset.xlsx`: The dataset containing clinical trial texts used as input for generating PPLS.
- `texts_generated_with_LLMs_evaluation_with_BERTScore.ipynb`: A notebook for evaluating the generated PPLS using BERTScore and other metrics.

## Contents

### ground_truth

This folder contains the original ground truth texts which serve as a reference for evaluating the generated PPLS. Each text is stored in a separate file.

### output_gpt4

This folder contains the PPLS generated by GPT-4. Each text is stored in a separate file corresponding to the input clinical trial text.

### output_gpt35

This folder contains the PPLS generated by GPT-3.5. Each text is stored in a separate file corresponding to the input clinical trial text.

### Clinical Trials_Test_Dataset.xlsx

This Excel file contains the clinical trial texts used as input for generating PPLS. The dataset is used in the `texts_generated_with_LLMs_and_evaluation.ipynb` notebook.

### texts_generated_with_LLMs_and_evaluation.ipynb

This notebook is used for evaluating the generated PPLS using BERTScore and other metrics. It includes the following steps:

1. Loading the necessary evaluation metrics.
2. Reading the generated texts and the ground truth texts.
3. Computing the BERTScore, BLEU, ROUGE, METEOR, and BLEURT scores for the generated texts.
4. Plotting the evaluation results for a visual comparison of the models.

## Usage

1. Place the ground truth texts in the `ground_truth` folder.
2. Generate PPLS using GPT-4 and GPT-3.5 and save them in the `output_gpt4` and `output_gpt35` folders, respectively.
3. Open and run the `texts_generated_with_LLMs_evaluation_with_BERTScore.ipynb` notebook to evaluate the generated texts using various metrics.
