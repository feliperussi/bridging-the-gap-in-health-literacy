We will update this review when new data are available. \\n• In future, we need high‐quality studies to evaluate medicines that block interleukin‐1 to treat COVID‐19.\\xa0 \\nWhat is interleukin‐1 and what is its role in COVID‐19? \\nInterleukin‐1 (IL‐1) is a type of protein called a cytokine, which helps to regulate the body’s immune system. In particular, IL‐1\\xa0triggers inflammation to help fight infection. In COVID‐19, as the immune system fights the virus, the lungs and airways become inflamed, causing breathing difficulties. However, in some people,\\xa0the immune system can over‐react (called a ‘cytokine storm’) and produce dangerously high levels of inflammation and tissue damage. This can lead to severe breathing difficulties, organ failure and death. \\nWhat are interleukin‐1 ‘blockers’? \\nIL‐1 blockers are medicines that stop IL‐1 from working by blocking signals from IL‐1 to other parts of the immune system. This\\xa0reduces inflammation and may help the immune system to fight COVID‐19. In turn, this\\xa0may reduce the need for breathing support with a ventilator (a machine that breathes for a patient) and reduce the number of deaths from COVID‐19. Three IL‐1 blockers are available: anakinra, canakinumab and rilonacept. \\nWhat did we want to find out? \\nWe wanted to know if IL‐1 blockers are effective treatments for people with COVID‐19, compared with\\xa0standard care alone or with placebo\\xa0(a dummy treatment that appears identical to the medicine being tested but without any active medicine). We were particularly interested in the effects of IL‐1 blockers on: \\n• \\xa0whether people’s symptoms got better or worse;\\n• \\xa0how many people died; and\\n• \\xa0any unwanted effects and serious unwanted effects.\\nWhat did we do? \\nWe searched for studies that assessed the effects of IL‐1 blockers to treat people with COVID‐19 compared with\\xa0standard care alone or with placebo. People in the studies could have suspected or confirmed COVID‐19 of any severity (mild, moderate or severe), and be any age or sex. \\nWe compared and summarised the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes. \\nWhat did we find? \\nWe found six studies with 2132 people. Four studies assessed anakinra (1633 people) and two assessed\\xa0canakinumab (499 people). People in the studies were aged between 58 and 68 years old on average, and the majority were men. All the people in the studies were in hospital, mainly with moderate to critical COVID‐19. The studies varied in size, from 45 to 2253 people. At the start of the studies, 67% to 100% of people were receiving oxygen, and 0% to 33% were on a ventilator. \\nWe also found 16 studies that have not yet published their results.\\nAnakinra compared to usual care and placebo to treat people with COVID‐19 \\n•\\xa0Anakinra probably results in little or no improvement in COVID‐19 symptoms (defined as improvement on a clinical scale or discharge from hospital) at 28 days after treatment (three studies, 837 people)\\xa0but we do not know if it makes a difference at 60 days (one study, 115 people). \\n•\\xa0We do not know if anakinra makes a difference to the number of deaths at 28 days after treatment (two studies, 722 people) or at 60 days (four studies, 1633 people). \\n•\\xa0Anakinra probably results in little or no increase in any unwanted effects at 28 days after treatment, but we are not sure about its effect on serious unwanted effects\\xa0(two studies, 722 people).\\xa0 \\nCanakinumab compared to usual care and placebo to treat people with COVID‐19 \\n•\\xa0Canakinumab probably results in little or no improvement in COVID‐19 symptoms (defined as improvement on a clinical scale or discharge from hospital) at 28 days after treatment (two studies, 499 people).\\xa0 \\n•\\xa0We do not know if canakinumab makes a difference to the number of deaths at 28 days after treatment (two studies, 499 people) or at 60 days (one study, 45 people).\\xa0 \\n•\\xa0Canakinumab probably results in little or no increase in any unwanted effects (one study, 454 people), but we are not sure about its effect on serious unwanted effects (two studies, 499 people) at 28 days.\\xa0 \\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence? \\nOur confidence in the evidence is limited for several reasons. All the people in the studies were hospitalised, but some were more seriously ill than others ‐ some studies only included people on a ventilator. Usual care also differed between studies, and studies measured and reported their results using different methods.\\xa0 \\nHow up to date is this evidence? \\nThe evidence is up to date to 5 November 2021.\\n', '10.1002-14651858.CD015270-pls.txt': 'Interventions to increase COVID‐19 vaccine uptake\\xa0\\nBackground \\nVaccines are effective in preventing death or severe illness from COVID‐19, a disease for which few treatments are available. Widespread vaccination against COVID‐19 may help protect those not yet able to get vaccinated. However, many people do not want to get vaccinated against COVID‐19. This can put them at increased risk of severe disease and death. \\nWhat was our aim? \\nWe wanted to find out which interventions to increase COVID‐19 vaccine uptake have been or are currently evaluated.\\xa0 \\nMethods \\nWe searched medical databases and trial registries until\\xa0the 11 of October 2021. We included all studies investigating interventions to increase COVID‐19 vaccine uptake. We excluded studies looking at other vaccines, for example, measles. We included all forms of studies as long as they had more than 100 participants.\\xa0 \\nOnce we found the studies, we categorised the interventions into the following groups: communication interventions, policy interventions, interventions to improve access, educational interventions, incentives, and multidimensional interventions. We summarised the results in an interactive scoping map. Furthermore, we mapped the study outcomes, the country in which the study was conducted, the study population, and the study design. \\nResults \\nWe included 96 studies in evidence mapping, 35 of which are ongoing and 61 studies with published results.\\xa0The interventions tested in these studies are very diverse. Many studies used communication strategies to convince people to get vaccinated against COVID‐19. \\xa0Interventions that included information on vaccination or a mixture of different strategies were also often used.\\xa0 \\nA majority of studies were conducted in English‐speaking countries of the global north, for example, the USA. Moreover, most studies investigated digital interventions in an online setting. The populations addressed varied across the studies. For example, studies addressed healthcare workers, ethnic minorities in the USA, students, soldiers, villagers, at‐risk patients, or the general population.\\xa0 \\nFor an overview, please see the interactive scoping map (https://tinyurl.com/2p9jmx24). \\xa0 \\nConclusion \\nWe identified a large number of studies that investigate how COVID‐19 vaccine uptake might be increased. However, more studies are needed focusing on lower‐middle‐income countries and on children. Future research should compare the effectiveness of different interventions to improve COVID‐19 vaccine uptake.\\xa0 \\n', '10.1002-14651858.CD011364.pub2-abstract.txt': 'Ultrasound use for insertion of arterial catheters in children\\nBackground \\nAn arterial catheter is a thin tube or line that can be inserted into an artery. Arterial catheters are used to monitor blood pressure during complex surgeries and during stays in intensive care. Ultrasound imaging (an image created with sound waves of soft tissue) allows anaesthesiologists and intensivists to see surrounding structures. Ultrasound can help medical practitioners accurately locate the artery and insert the catheter, and, particularly when surgeries involve children, ultrasound can prevent the need for multiple needle sticks. This reduces the occurrence of haematoma (a localized collection of blood outside the blood vessels) or damage to the artery, compared with other techniques such as palpation of the artery (feeling through the skin for the pulse) or Doppler auditory assistance (listening for a change to a higher pitch at the exact location of the artery). Our aim was to find out whether ultrasound offers any advantages over palpation of the artery or Doppler auditory assistance. \\nStudy characteristics \\nThe evidence is current to January 2016. We found five eligible studies ‐ four comparing ultrasound with palpation and one comparing ultrasound with Doppler auditory assistance. \\nKey results \\nWe included in the review children aged one month to 18 years. We found that ultrasound increased the rate of successful cannulation at the first attempt and reduced the formation of haematomas. Ultrasound also increased the success rate within two attempts. It is likely that ultrasound is more useful for infants and small children than for older children. It is also likely that ultrasound is more useful if the practitioner is experienced in its use. \\nQuality of the evidence \\nWe noted variation in the risk of bias of included studies. We rated the quality of evidence as moderate mainly because the number of studies was limited. For the same reason, we could not confirm the effect of age and expertise in ultrasound usage. \\nConclusions \\nOur evidence suggests that ultrasound is superior to other techniques for arterial catheter insertion, particularly in babies and young children. \\n', '10.1002-14651858.CD013438-pls.txt': 'Beta‐blockers to prevent death or serious events after surgery not involving the heart\\nThis review assessed evidence from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on whether beta‐blockers reduce deaths or other serious events when given to people undergoing surgery other than heart surgery. The findings for heart surgery are covered in another review. \\nBackground \\nSurgery increases stress in the body, which responds by releasing the hormones adrenaline and noradrenaline. Stress from surgery can lead to death or other serious events such as heart attacks, stroke, or an irregular heartbeat. For surgery that does not involve the heart, an estimated 8% of people may have injury to their heart around the time of surgery. Beta‐blockers are drugs that block the action of adrenaline and noradrenaline on the heart. Beta‐blockers can slow down the heart, and reduce blood pressure, and this may reduce the risk of serious events. However, beta‐blockers may lead to a very low heart rate or very low blood pressure which could increase the risk of death or a stroke. Prevention of early complications after surgery is important, but using beta‐blockers to prevent these complications is controversial. \\nStudy characteristics \\nThe evidence is current to 28 June 2019. We included 83 RCTs with 14,967 adults who were undergoing different types of surgery other than heart surgery. Eighteen studies are awaiting classification (because we did not have enough details to assess them), and three studies are ongoing. The types of beta‐blockers used in the studies were: propranolol, metoprolol, esmolol, landiolol, nadolol, atenolol, labetalol, oxprenolol, and pindolol. Studies compared these beta‐blockers with either a placebo (disguised to look like a beta‐blocker but containing no medicine) or with standard care. \\nKey results \\nBeta‐blockers may make little or no difference to the number of people who die within 30 days of surgery (16 studies, 11,446 participants; low‐certainty evidence), have a stroke (6 studies, 9460 participants; low‐certainty evidence), or experience ventricular arrhythmias (irregular heartbeat rhythms, starting in the main chambers of the heart, that are potentially life‐threatening and may need immediate medical treatment; 5 studies, 476 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). We found that beta‐blockers may reduce atrial fibrillation (an irregular heartbeat, starting in the atrial chambers of the heart, that increases the risk of stroke if untreated; 9 studies, 9080 participants; low certainty‐evidence), and the number of people who have a heart attack (12 studies, 10,520 participants; low‐certainty evidence). However, taking beta‐blockers may increase the number of people who experience a very low heart rate (49 studies, 12,239 participants; low‐certainty evidence), or very low blood pressure (49 studies, 12,304 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence), around the time of surgery. \\nIn a few studies, we also found little or no difference in the number of people who died after 30 days, who died because of a heart problem, or had heart failure. We found no evidence of whether beta‐blockers alter the length of time in hospital. \\nNo studies assessed whether people who were given beta‐blockers had a better quality of life after heart surgery. \\nCertainty of the evidence \\nThe certainty of the evidence in this review was limited by including some studies that were at high risk of bias, and we noticed that some of our findings were different if we only included placebo‐controlled studies or studies that reported how participants were randomized. We also found one large, well‐conducted, international study that had different findings to the smaller studies. It showed a reduction in heart attacks and an increase in stroke and all‐cause mortality when beta‐blockers were used, whilst the other studies did not show a clear effect. We were also less certain of the findings for outcomes with few studies, such as for ventricular arrhythmias. \\nConclusion \\nAlthough beta‐blockers may make little or no difference to the number of people who die within 30 days, have a stroke, or have ventricular arrhythmias, they may reduce atrial fibrillation and heart attacks. Taking beta‐blockers may increase the number of people with a very low heart rate or very low blood pressure around the time of surgery. Further evidence from large, placebo‐controlled trials is likely to increase the certainty of these findings, and we recommend the assessment of impact on quality of life. \\n', '10.1002-14651858.CD013315-pls.txt': \"Diverse strategies for preventing high altitude illness\\nBackground \\nThe term high altitude illness (HAI) is used to describe a group of brain and lung conditions that can occur when people travel to altitudes above approximately 2500 metres (approximately 8200 feet). Individuals can respond to high altitudes in different ways and experience a variety of symptoms. These include HAI‐related headache, nausea, vomiting and tiredness, often called acute mountain sickness. Drowsiness, confusion or unconsciousness can occur when the brain is particularly affected (high altitude cerebral oedema or HACE), and cough or breathlessness when it is the lungs (high altitude pulmonary oedema or HAPE). A number of different strategies are used to prevent HAI. In this review we assessed the evidence from randomized controlled trials on whether various approaches could prevent the onset of high altitude illness, with a focus on non‐drug approaches, herbs and natural supplements. \\nStudy characteristics \\nThe evidence is current to January 2019. We included 20 randomized controlled studies involving 1406 participants. The studies looked at diverse approaches to HAI prevention. These approaches included strategies to acclimatize to high altitudes by mimicking quick ascents by reducing levels of oxygen in the air that participants are breathing, and herbal products or vitamin supplements available without a prescription. \\nThe participants ranged in age between 17 and 65 years. Only one study included people at high risk of developing HAI as they had a history of HAI. Four trials provided the intervention between one to three days before making the ascent (20% of the studies), and eight between four to 30 days before departure for the ascent (40% of the studies). The participants in all these studies reached a final altitude of between 3500 and 5500 metres above sea level. Most of the studies did not provide clear information on how they were funded (55% of studies). Thirty additional studies were classified as either ongoing (14 studies), or awaiting classification (16 studies), and they will be considered in future versions of this suite of three reviews as appropriate. \\nKey results \\nThe evidence for any benefit of the various strategies is inconclusive, and even contradictory among the included studies. \\nIn three studies comparing normal levels of oxygen with low oxygen levels as a way of acclimatization before leaving for high altitudes, we found no differences in the risk of developing acute mountain sickness (3 trials, 140 participants; low‐quality evidence). Adverse events were not reported, nor were high altitude cerebral oedema (HACE) or pulmonary oedema (HAPE). \\nGinkgo biloba was compared with taking an inactive placebo in seven studies (523 participants) looking at acute mountain sickness. There was no difference between ginkgo biloba and placebo in terms of the risk of developing HACE (3 studies, 371 participants), or in the risk of developing tingling or pricking, often described as 'pins and needles', as a side effect of treatment (2 studies, 352 participants). No HAPE events were reported (3 studies, 371 participants). \\nGinkgo biloba was compared with acetazolamide, which is a drug used to prevent acute mountain sickness, in four studies (397 participants). The findings differed between the studies, and no conclusions could be drawn. Acetazolamide increased the risk of developing pins and needles in two studies (354 participants). No HAPE or HACE events were reported. Overall, the limited information on the safety of the various interventions means that their safety remains unclear. \\nQuality of the evidence \\nThe quality of the evidence was low to very low. We could not obtain the full text reports of some of the studies we had identified, which limited the number of studies included in the review. Many of the studies had small numbers of participants; and for some outcomes few events occurred so that any findings were uncertain. Additional research is needed to clarify the effectiveness and safety of the various strategies to reduce HAI. \\n\", '10.1002-14651858.CD013424.pub2-pls.txt': 'Pharmacological treatments for osteoporosis in patients with chronic kidney disease\\nWhat is the issue?Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) have an increased risk of osteoporosis (weakened bone strength), which can often lead to bone fracture. Several drugs are available for the treatment of osteoporosis; however, it is unknown whether these drugs are equally effective and safe in patients with CKD because bone strength impairment in these patients occurs via a different mechanism. \\nWhat did we do?Data were collected from studies including patients with osteoporosis and CKD stages 3‐5, and those undergoing dialysis (stage 5D) with data available on fracture, change in the bone mineral density (BMD; a bone strength index), and adverse events. We included seven studies with available evidence up to 25 January 2021, comparing anti‐osteoporotic drugs (abaloparatide, alendronate, denosumab, raloxifene, and teriparatide) with placebo (a dummy drug), in 9,164 postmenopausal women. We performed a meta‐analysis to assess the effects of these anti‐osteoporotic drugs. \\nWhat did we find?In postmenopausal women with CKD stages 3‐4, anti‐osteoporotic drugs may reduce vertebral fracture in low certainty evidence. Anti‐osteoporotic drugs probably make little or no difference to clinical fracture and adverse events in moderate certainty evidence. In postmenopausal with CKD stages 5 or 5D, it is uncertain whether anti‐osteoporotic drug reduces the risk of clinical fracture and death, and anti‐osteoporotic drug may slightly improve BMD at the lumbar spine in low certainty evidence. It is uncertain whether anti‐osteoporotic drug improve BMD at the femoral neck. \\nConclusionsAmong postmenopausal women with CKD stages 3‐4, anti‐osteoporotic drugs may reduce the risk of vertebral fracture. Among patients with CKD stages 5 and 5D, anti‐osteoporotic drug may slightly improve bone strength. However, these conclusions are based on limited data and therefore uncertain. \\n', '10.1002-14651858.CD013489.pub2-pls.txt': 'Medicine‐free treatment for stuttering in children aged six years and younger\\nWhat was the aim of this review? \\nThe aim of this review was to find out if\\xa0medicine‐free treatment for stuttering can improve speech fluency,\\xa0children\\'s communication attitudes and the impact on the child\\'s quality of life, and potential harmful effects in\\xa0children aged six years and younger, both in the short‐ and long‐term. We collected and analyzed all relevant studies to answer this question and found four studies. \\nKey messages \\nThe Lidcombe Program may result in lower stuttering frequency and higher speech efficiency\\xa0(i.e. number of words or syllables spoken per minute) for young children after receiving the amount of treatment included in the studies. We do not yet know the impact of the programme delivered in its entirety, as no study reported outcomes for children who had completed the programme, which is designed to last for one to two years. \\nOnly one study reported how treatment worked in the long run, but the effect of treatment could not be summarized, as the results for most children in the control group were missing. \\nWe require more high‐quality studies assessing stuttering treatments for young children, including studies that report on a broader range of outcomes and that assess treatments other than the Lidcombe Program. \\nWhat did the review study? \\nStuttering, or stammering as it is sometimes called, is a common communication disorder, that usually begins when children are between two and four years of age. Stuttering can be characterized by repetitions of individual speech sounds, parts of words or whole words; involuntary lengthening of speech sounds; or speech blockages. Moments of stuttering can also be accompanied by visible tension in the speaker\\'s face or voice, eye blinks or head nods. Stuttering can have a negative effect on how people feel about themselves and how they live their lives. Therefore, it is important to identify effective treatments for stuttering in young children to reduce the chance that they will experience these negative effects. \\nWhat were the main results of the review?\\xa0 \\nWe found four\\xa0studies, all of which compared young children who received the Lidcombe Program to young children on a wait‐list. In three studies, the children on the wait‐list did not receive any treatment until after the study was finished. In the fourth, the children on the wait‐list could receive treatment from their local speech language therapist (SLT) if they wanted to. At the end of the study, parents of seven children (35%) in the control group reported their child had received some treatment, either the Lidcombe Program or another treatment programme called \"Easy Does It\", while on the wait‐list. \\nThere were 151 children aged between two\\xa0and six\\xa0years in the four studies. In the Lidcombe Program, an SLT\\xa0conducted clinic visits with\\xa0the child and parent\\xa0in person\\xa0in a clinic or\\xa0spoke to them\\xa0by telephone. During these visits, parents were taught to conduct treatment\\xa0at home during 10‐ to 15‐minute daily\\xa0practice sessions. Two studies were conducted in Australia, one in New Zealand and one in Germany. Two studies were conducted for nine\\xa0months, one for 16 weeks and one for 12 weeks. One study was partially funded by the Rotary Club, Wiesbaden, Germany; and one was funded by the National Health and Medical Research Council of Australia.\\xa0One study did not report any funding sources and another reported that they did not receive any funding for the trial. \\nAll four studies reported the effects\\xa0of treatment on stuttering frequency. One study also reported on speech efficiency. We found no studies that looked at the effects of treatments for stuttering on stuttering severity;\\xa0communication attitudes;\\xa0emotional (how a child recognizes, expresses, and manages feelings), cognitive (how a child thinks, explores and works problems out) or psychosocial (how a child\\'s individual needs link to the needs or demands of society) development; or side effects. \\nThe included studies suggest that the Lidcombe Program may reduce stuttering frequency in young children compared to a wait‐list control group (very low‐quality evidence). One study also reported that the Lidcombe Program may increase speech efficiency in young children compared to a\\xa0wait‐list control group (moderate‐quality evidence). \\nOnly one study followed the children up to five years after treatment started, and at that time the results for most of the children in the control group were missing. Therefore, we do not know if the benefits of the treatment lasted over time. \\nHow up‐to‐date was this review? \\nWe searched for studies that had been published up to 16 September 2020. One additional database was searched on 20 October 2020.\\xa0 \\nHow reliable was the evidence generated by this review? \\nThe quality of the results related to stuttering frequency was very low and the results related to speech efficiency was moderate. This means\\xa0that we are uncertain that the treatment effect would stay the same if we added more studies to the review. More studies comparing different treatments for stuttering to a wait‐list control group are needed to know the effect of treatment for stuttering with greater certainty. \\n', '10.1002-14651858.CD013230-pls.txt': \"First aid treatments for oral poisoning\\nReview question \\nWe reviewed the evidence on the effects of first aid treatments for poisoning that could be feasibly given by people who are not health professionals. \\nBackground \\nMany first aid treatments are recommended for treating people who have ingested poisonous substances. Some treatments, such as activated charcoal (AC), bind to the poison, limiting the body's absorption of it. Others may induce vomiting (such as syrup of ipecac) or dilute or neutralize the poison (such as drinking water, milk or juices). Adjusting the person's body position may also have an effect. \\nStudy characteristics \\nIn December 2018 we searched for high‐quality studies (randomly dividing participants into different treatment groups) investigating treatments for poisoning that laypeople can perform. We found 24 studies with 7099 participants. All but one study took place in hospitals; the remaining one was in a home setting. \\nFourteen studies either did not specify the type of poison or studied different kinds. The others investigated overdoses of specific medicines (paracetamol, carbamazepine, antidepressant, benzodiazepine) or poisonous plants (yellow oleander or poisonous berries). \\nTwenty‐one trials studied different treatments with activated charcoal: as a single dose or multiple doses, with or without other first aid treatments (a substance to speed up bowel transit), and with or without hospital treatments. Six studies compared syrup of ipecac, with or without other first aid treatments (single‐dose activated charcoal plus bowel transit enhancing substance) versus no treatment. We found no studies that investigated the neutralization or dilution of the poison or the use of certain body positions. \\nKey results \\nTwo studies compared a single dose of activated charcoal to no treatment following poisoning with paracetamol or different kinds of poisoning. We are uncertain about the treatment's side effects, admission to intensive care or worsening of the patient, and there was no information about effects on death, symptom duration, poison uptake or hospitalization. \\nOne study compared a single dose of activated charcoal to ipecac in mixed types of poisoning. We are uncertain about the effect of activated charcoal compared to ipecac, on the patient's level of coma or the number of unwanted effects. There was no information about effects on death, symptom duration, poison uptake, hospitalization or intensive care admission. \\nOne study compared ipecac to no treatment in children who ate poisonous berries at home. There may be an increase in the number of unwanted effects for ipecac. There was no information about effects on death, poisoning symptoms, symptoms duration, poison uptake, hospitalization or intensive care admission. \\nWe also investigated the use of single‐dose or multi‐dose activated charcoal, with or without hospital treatment, compared to each other or no treatment. Furthermore, we investigated the added value of ipecac to single‐dose activated charcoal and the added value of adding bowel transit enhancing substances to AC. \\nCertainty of the evidence \\nAll but one study took place in a hospital setting, which means that the results cannot be directly applied to the lay setting. Because studies did not always report the methods they used, we are uncertain about the quality of the research conduct for many. Outcomes important to patients and pre‐specified by us as important outcomes for this review were often absent or incompletely reported. Our certainty about the results of this review is mostly low to very low. Therefore future research is highly likely to change the findings. \\nConclusion \\nBased on the identified evidence, we cannot draw any conclusions about the effects of any of the investigated first aid treatments in a lay setting. \\n\", '10.1002-14651858.CD013352.pub2-pls.txt': \"In‐bag manual versus uncontained power morcellation for laparoscopic myomectomy\\nReview question \\nCochrane authors reviewed the effectiveness and safety of in‐bag manual morcellation compared to uncontained power morcellation during laparoscopic myomectomy. The primary outcome of the review was a composite of intraoperative (during surgery) complications. \\nBackground \\nMyomectomy is a surgical procedure to remove uterine fibroids — also called leiomyomas. These common, non‐cancerous growths usually develop in the uterus during childbearing years, but they can occur at any age. In laparoscopic myomectomy, which is a minimally invasive procedure, the surgeon accesses and removes the fibroids through several small abdominal incisions. \\nLaparoscopic myomectomy is the gold standard for women with uterine leiomyomas, but it is difficult to remove large fibroids through the small incisions and tubes (laparoscopes). To overcome this challenge, surgeons developed a technique to break the large fibroids into smaller pieces (morcellation). \\nHowever, power morcellation (using a drill‐like instrument to cut up the fibroids) inside the abdomen may lead to the scattering of the tissues. These tissues may be benign (such as fibroids or endometriosis), but they may also be tissues from an undiagnosed cancer. A strategy to optimise women's safety is to cut up larger fibroids with a scalpel or scissors, inside a bag. \\nStudy Characteristics \\nWe included two randomised controlled trials, which enrolled 176 premenopausal women undergoing laparoscopic myomectomy; they were randomised to receive either in‐bag manual morcellation (87 women) or uncontained power morcellation (89 women). The literature was searched to 1 July 2019. \\nKey results \\nNeither study reported complications during or after surgery, including no diagnoses of leiomyosarcoma, for women in either group. \\nWe are very uncertain whether in‐bag morcellation reduces the total time of the operation, or improves the ease of morcellation. The evidence suggests that the morcellation operative time was slightly longer when the surgeon used in‐bag morcellation. However, the quality of the evidence is very low and we cannot be certain of any of these results. \\nQuality of the evidence \\nThe evidence was of very low quality. The main limitations were indirectness (both trials took place in high‐income settings and countries, therefore, our findings are limited to this type of setting), and imprecision (both trials had small sample sizes and wide confidence intervals). \\n\", '10.1002-14651858.CD013270.pub2-pls.txt': 'Surgery on both eyes on the same day or on different days: which works better to treat cataract in both eyes? \\nKey messages \\n‐ Current evidence supports there may be no important difference between surgery on both eyes on the same day (ISBCS) and surgery on different days (DSBCS) for the following clinical outcomes: eye (ocular) infection (endophthalmitis, a severe, sight‐threatening but rare complication), spectacle correction after surgery (refraction), complications, vision with spectacle correction (if needed), and patient‐reported outcomes (PROMs; questionnaires on vision). \\n‐ Current evidence supports the costs for ISBCS are lower compared to DSBCS, but evidence on the balance between the costs and how well it works (cost‐effectiveness) was lacking. \\n‐ Overall, the amount and quality of the evidence was limited.\\nWhat is cataract and how is it treated? \\nAge‐related cataract is a natural ageing process of the lens of the eye, in which the lens becomes cloudy and vision decreases. The only way to treat cataract is by surgery. During surgery, the clouded lens is removed and replaced by an artificial lens, implanted in the eye. Currently, most people undergo cataract surgery on both eyes on different days, with a period of days, weeks, or even months between surgeries, called delayed sequential bilateral cataract surgery (DSBCS). However, it is also possible to have cataract surgery on both eyes on the same day, called immediate sequential bilateral cataract surgery (ISBCS). \\nPotential advantages to ISBCS include fewer visits to the hospital, faster visual recovery, and lower healthcare costs. However, there are also potential disadvantages, such as developing complications in both eyes. Also, in ISBCS, outcomes of the first eye cannot be used when performing second‐eye surgery, which may result in worse refractive outcomes (increased spectacle dependence). \\nWhat did we want to find out? \\nWe wanted to find out if cataract surgery on both eyes on the same day is as safe, effective, and cost‐effective as having surgery on both eyes on different days. \\nWhat did we do?\\xa0 \\nWe searched for studies that looked at outcomes of ISBCS compared to DSBCS. We also searched for studies that looked at the balance between costs and outcomes for ISBCS compared to DSBCS (cost‐effectiveness). We compared and summarised the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes. \\nWhat did we find?\\xa0 \\nWe found 14 studies that involved 276,260 people (7384 who had ISBCS and 268,876 who had DSBCS). The studies were conducted in Canada, the Czech Republic, Finland, Iran, (South) Korea, Spain (Canary Islands), Sweden, the UK, and the USA. Most studies lasted for around three months. \\nMain results\\xa0 \\n‐ Endophthalmitis: the type of surgery (ISBCS or DSBCS) may make little to no difference in the occurrence of endophthalmitis in one eye (up to six weeks after surgery). None of the studies reported endophthalmitis in both eyes, but this event is most likely too rare to be detected by these studies. \\n‐ Refractive outcomes: there is probably little to no difference in refractive outcomes at one to three months after surgery with ISBCS compared to DSBCS. \\n‐ Other complications: there may be little to no difference in other complications up to three months after surgery with ISBCS compared to DSBCS, but we are very uncertain about the results. \\n‐ Costs: the economic studies in this review reported lower costs for ISBCS compared to DSBCS. One study reported that ISBCS is cost‐effective compared to DSBCS, but we are very uncertain about the results. \\n‐ Best‐corrected distance visual acuity (BCDVA; vision with spectacle correction if needed): the type of surgery (ISBCS or DSBCS) may have little to no effect on BCDVA at one to three months after surgery, but we are very uncertain about the results. \\n‐ PROMs (measured in questionnaires): the type of surgery (ISBCS or DSBCS) probably makes little to no difference in PROMs at one to three months after surgery. \\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence? \\nOverall, we had moderate to very little confidence in the evidence (endophthalmitis: little confidence, refractive outcomes: little to moderate confidence, complications: not confident, costs: little to no confidence, BCDVA: not confident, and PROMs: moderate confidence).\\xa0 \\nOur confidence is limited because:\\n‐ the evidence on endophthalmitis was based on few cases of endophthalmitis;\\n‐ the studies assessed complications in different ways;\\n‐ there were not enough studies to be certain about refractive outcomes and complications;\\n‐ studies on costs reported costs for only one hospital and included different funding sources; \\n‐ the studies assessed BCDVA in different ways and there were not enough studies to be certain about the results; \\n‐ there were concerns regarding the possibility that people in the studies were aware of what treatment they were getting, and not all studies provided data about everything that we were interested in (most outcomes).\\xa0 \\nHow up to date is this evidence? \\nThe evidence is up‐to‐date to 11 May 2021.\\n', '10.1002-14651858.CD013501.pub2-pls.txt': 'Vegan diets for the prevention of cardiovascular disease\\nBackground \\nIt is well known that diet plays a major role in cardiovascular disease risk. This review assesses the effects of providing dietary advice to follow a vegan diet (excluding all meat, fish, eggs, dairy and honey) or providing foods relevant to the diet (or both) to healthy adults, to people at increased risk of cardiovascular disease and to those with cardiovascular disease, in order to prevent new or recurrent cardiovascular disease, and to reduce the risk factors associated with it. \\nStudy characteristics \\nWe searched key databases of medical studies up to February 2020 and found 13 randomised controlled trials (RCTs) (in 38 papers) that met our criteria. We grouped studies into the following three categories to help us with our interpretation of the results: \\n1. Vegan dietary intervention compared to no intervention or a minimal intervention to prevent the onset of cardiovascular disease;2. Vegan dietary intervention compared to another dietary intervention to prevent the onset of cardiovascular disease;3. Vegan dietary intervention compared to another dietary intervention for people with existing cardiovascular disease, to prevent recurrence. \\nKey results \\nNone of the trials reported on the occurrence of cardiovascular disease either in those with or without disease to begin with. Risk factors for cardiovascular disease were reported in the included studies. There was moderate‐certainty evidence for some small reductions in lipid levels with the vegan diet compared to no or minimal intervention in people without disease, but also some very small changes in measures in the opposite direction for cardiovascular benefit. In people who already had cardiovascular disease there was very limited information, as only one trial met our criteria. Four trials reported on side effects of the diet, which were either absent or minor. \\nCertainty of the evidence \\nMost studies had limitations in study design, so the evidence should be interpreted cautiously. In particular, the overall number of people who took part in the studies was too small to rule out the possibility of chance findings, and too small to pick up any differences in effect on our measures. \\nConclusions \\nThe review concludes that there is no information currently about the effects of a vegan diet on cardiovascular disease occurrence. There is limited information on the effects of the diet on those who already have cardiovascular disease, and mixed results about risk factors for those without disease. We found eight studies that are still ongoing, and when we have the results from these we will incorporate them into the review to help reduce the uncertainty. \\n', '10.1002-14651858.CD006919.pub4-abstract.txt': 'Gonadotrophin‐releasing hormone agonists (GnRHa) used as an adjuvant to gonadotrophins in assisted reproduction treatments \\nReview question \\nResearchers from the Cochrane Collaboration reviewed the evidence about the most effective way of using gonadotrophin‐releasing hormone agonists (GnRHa) as part of controlled ovarian stimulation in women undergoing assisted reproduction technology (ART). \\nBackground \\nGnRHa are given along with hormone injections that stimulate the ovaries, in an attempt to prevent spontaneous release of eggs prior to their planned surgical retrieval. GnRHa have been proven to improve pregnancy rates; however, various regimens are described in the literature. We conducted this review to identify the most effective regimens. \\nStudy characteristics \\nWe found 37 randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of 3872 women comparing the use of GnRHa in various protocols. Twenty of these RCTs (1643 women) compared a long protocol with a short protocol. The evidence is current to April 2015. \\nKey results \\nIn comparisons of long GnRHa protocols (where GnRHa is given for at least 14 days prior to the start of ovarian stimulation) versus short GnRHa protocols (when the GnRHa is given at the start of stimulation) there was no conclusive evidence of a difference in live birth and ongoing pregnancy rates. However there was moderate quality evidence of higher clinical pregnancy rates in the long protocol groups. Our findings suggest that in a population in which 14% of women achieve live birth or ongoing pregnancy using a short protocol, between 13% and 23% will achieve live birth or ongoing pregnancy using a long protocol. \\nNone of the other analyses showed any evidence of a difference in birth or pregnancy outcomes between the protocols compared. There was insufficient evidence to make any conclusions regarding adverse effects. Further research is needed to determine which long protocol is most cost effective and acceptable to women. \\nQuality of the evidence \\nThe quality of the evidence ranged from moderate to low. The main limitations in the evidence were failure to report live birth or ongoing pregnancy, poor reporting of methods in the primary studies, and imprecise findings due to lack of data. Only 10 of the 37 included studies were conducted within the last 10 years. \\n', '10.1002-14651858.CD013669.pub2-pls.txt': 'Drugs and natural products for self‐harm in adults\\nWe have reviewed the international literature regarding pharmacological (drug) and natural product (dietary supplementation) treatment trials in the field. A total of seven trials meeting our inclusion criteria were identified. There is little evidence of beneficial effects of either pharmacological or natural product treatments. However, few trials have been conducted and those that have are small, meaning that possible beneficial effects of some therapies cannot be ruled out. \\nWhy is this review important? \\nSelf‐harm (SH), which includes intentional self‐poisoning/overdose and self‐injury, is a major problem in many countries and is strongly linked with suicide. It is therefore important that effective treatments for SH patients are developed. Whilst there has been an increase in the use of psychosocial interventions for SH in adults (which is the focus of a separate review), drug treatments are frequently used in clinical practice. It is therefore important to assess the evidence for their effectiveness. \\nWho will be interested in this review? \\nHospital administrators (e.g.\\xa0service providers), health policy officers and third party payers (e.g.\\xa0health insurers), clinicians working with patients who engage in SH, patients themselves, and their relatives. \\nWhat questions does this review aim to answer? \\nThis review is an update of a previous Cochrane Review from 2015 which found little evidence of beneficial effects of drug treatments on repetition of SH. This updated aims to further evaluate the evidence for effectiveness of drugs and natural products for patients who engage in\\xa0SH with a broader range of outcomes. \\nWhich studies were included in the review? \\nTo be included in the review, studies had to be randomised controlled trials of drug treatments for adults who had recently engaged in SH. \\nWhat does the evidence from the review tell us? \\nThere is currently no clear evidence for the effectiveness of antidepressants, antipsychotics, mood stabilisers, or natural products in preventing repetition of SH. \\nWhat should happen next? \\nWe recommend further trials of drugs for SH patients, possibly in combination with psychological treatment. \\n', '10.1002-14651858.CD012470.pub2-abstract.txt': \"Interventions for treating wrist fractures (broken wrists) in children\\nBackground and aim \\nWrist fractures are the most common bone injury in children. Most are buckle (or torus) fractures, where the bone surface bulges out. These minor fractures heal well. They are often treated with a wrist splint or a below‐elbow plaster cast.  More serious fractures are where the bone breaks, generally resulting in displacement of the bone parts. Usually the bone is manipulated back into place ('reduction'), followed by cast immobilisation, often with an above‐elbow cast including the elbow. When considered, surgery generally involves placing wires through the skin and into the bone (percutaneous wiring). \\nWe aimed to assess the best‐quality evidence for different treatments of wrist fractures in children. \\nResults of the search \\nWe searched medical databases up to May 2018 and included 30 studies with 2930 children. Studies included more male children and reported mean ages between eight and 10 years. We summarise the results from five key comparisons. \\nKey results \\nSix studies compared a removable splint with a below‐elbow cast for buckle fractures. One study found there may be little or no difference between the two devices in physical function at four weeks. Few children needed a change or reapplication of either splint or cast (4 studies). There were no refractures. We are uncertain whether there is any difference in pain during device use. There was insufficient evidence to evaluate time to return to former activities (recovery time), minor complications, and child or parent satisfaction. Two studies found lower healthcare costs for splints. \\nFour studies compared a soft or elasticated bandage with a below‐elbow cast for buckle fractures. We are uncertain if there is less disability at four weeks after bandaging. Few children changed device or needed extended immobilisation (3 studies). There were no serious adverse events. There was insufficient evidence to evaluate recovery time, wrist pain, minor complications, and satisfaction. Children found the bandage more convenient (1 study). \\nTwo studies (mainly buckle fractures) compared cast removal at home by parents versus at the hospital fracture clinic by clinicians (a cast saw was not required for home removal). All had recovered function at four weeks (1 study). There were few treatment changes and no serious adverse effects. Recovery time and number of children with minor complications were not reported. There may be no difference in pain at four weeks (1 study). There may be greater parental satisfaction for cast removal at home (1 study). One study found lower healthcare costs for home removal. \\nFour studies compared below‐elbow versus above‐elbow casts in usually displaced fractures. We are uncertain if children are less dependent on help when using below‐elbow casts. We are uncertain if there is a difference between the two casts in physical function at six months (1 study). We are uncertain about the finding that all children with above‐elbow casts needed another fracture reduction. There were no serious adverse events. Recovery time and minor complications were not reported. There may be little difference in needing physiotherapy for stiffness. Pain at one week may be less for below‐elbow casts (1 study). One study found lower healthcare costs for below‐elbow casts. \\nFive studies compared percutaneous wiring and above‐elbow cast immobilisation versus above‐elbow cast immobilisation alone after closed reduction of displaced fractures. Short‐term physical function was not reported. There may be no between‐group difference in function at six months (1 study). We are uncertain whether surgery reduces the risk of treatment failure, defined as early or difficult removal of wires, and remanipulation for loss in position. We are uncertain whether there are fewer serious adverse events with surgery. Recovery time, wrist pain, and satisfaction were not reported. There may be less need for physiotherapy after surgery. One USA study found treatment costs were similar. \\nQuality of the evidence \\nAll 30 studies had weaknesses that could affect the reliability of their results. We considered the evidence for all outcomes to be low or very low quality. \\nConclusion \\nThere is not enough evidence to determine the best ways of treating different types of wrist fractures in children. However, the review findings are consistent with the move away from cast immobilisation for buckle fractures. \\n\", '10.1002-14651858.CD013440.pub2-pls.txt': \"Improving the outcome of people with primary brain tumours and their carers using early palliative interventions \\nWhy this question is important \\nBrain tumours can have a significant impact on people and their carers. Brain tumours can impair people's physical, neurocognitive, and social functioning, which can affect the whole family, particularly informal caregivers, who often receive inadequate support. There is evidence in other cancers that providing access to palliative support in the early stages of a person's illness can help to improve their, and their caregivers', quality of life. However, it has not been confirmed that this is the case for people with brain tumours. \\nObjectives \\nWe aimed to assess studies that included early palliative care interventions, including referral to specialist palliative care services compared to usual care, for improving outcomes in adults diagnosed with a primary brain tumour and their carers. \\nHow we searched for evidence \\nWe searched electronic medical literature databases for studies that included a range of different types of medical trials, both published and ongoing. We handsearched the reference lists of key papers and searched for key authors of research in the area. We included adults confirmed with a primary brain tumour and informal caregivers such as relatives. \\nWhat we found \\nWe could not find any trials examining the impact of specialist palliative care teams on outcomes for patients or their carers. We included one trial which focused on a single symptom area – that of cognition – in a patient group of whom about half had a high‐grade tumour. The trial randomised patients between a group receiving a structured cognitive rehabilitation intervention and a group receiving usual rehabilitation care of medications and physiotherapy. Cognitive rehabilitation consisted of supervised computer‐based exercises, lasting 45 minutes at a time, four times a week, over a four‐week period. There was no important difference between the two groups apart from some improvement in visual attention and verbal memory in those who received the cognitive rehabilitation intervention. However, we assessed the certainty of the evidence as being very low, and we could find no evidence in this or other studies on any other aspect of palliative care. \\nWhat this means \\nNot enough research has been undertaken on early palliative care interventions which support people with primary brain tumours, and their caregivers. Research is needed which examines co‐ordinated approaches to overall palliative care provision, and interventions which focus on specific aspects of palliation in this population. \\n\", '10.1002-14651858.CD013246.pub2-pls.txt': \"Digital interventions for people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)\\nReview question \\nDo digital interventions help people to improve their self‐management of COPD and their health? Do they help to change their behaviour about managing their symptoms? \\nWhat is COPD? \\nCOPD is a chronic and progressive condition affecting the airways and lungs. Typically, COPD results from prolonged exposure to harmful chemicals found in tobacco smoke, leading to inflammation of the airways, as well as abnormal expansion of the airspaces of the lungs. Owing to the highly varied\\xa0nature of COPD, there is much variety in how the condition affects individuals’ lives. A persistent cough and breathlessness are characteristic symptoms of COPD, worsening during flare‐ups (exacerbations) and becoming more severe over time. This makes activities of daily living more difficult and greatly impacts quality of life. \\nManaging COPD is complex and varies depending on the severity of the condition. Self‐management techniques often play a role in relieving symptoms, such as breathing exercises, as well as a combination of medication and supplementary oxygen. \\n'Digital interventions' and 'telehealth' are terms used to encompass the use of technology to communicate and send information between a patient and a healthcare provider ‐ helping to manage the patient’s condition remotely. This may involve (but is not restricted to) the use of a mobile phone or tablet computer application to log symptoms and lung function, allowing a clinician to adjust medications in real‐time. It may also involve remotely training a patient in self‐management techniques. There is scope for those living with COPD to greatly benefit from the use of such interventions, offering convenient and accessible healthcare provision. \\nWhy did we do this review? \\nWe wanted to find out if digital interventions were helpful for people with COPD in terms of managing their condition, and if these interventions played a part in changing their behaviour towards self‐management. Additionally, we wanted to understand the behaviour change techniques incorporated in different digital interventions. \\nWhat evidence did we find? \\nMostly, digital interventions or multi component approaches did not improve walking distance or betterment in one's own belief in managing their condition. There was small short‐term improvement in quality of life with Internet‐based interventions but we cannot be certain whether the improvement is seen long term.\\xa0Breathing difficulties may improve with long‐term use of digital interventions, but they may have little to no effect on flare‐ups. Due to limited data available, we cannot say with confidence that digital interventions can be used to improve health in people with COPD, or that they reduce harm. There is little or no evidence about possible unwanted side‐effects of digital interventions.\\xa0More research in this field can provide more robust conclusions for their use and insight into people's behaviours towards these novel approaches. \\n\", '10.1002-14651858.CD011931.pub2-abstract.txt': \"Preventing pain after brain surgery\\nThe problem \\nThere is increasing evidence that people who have undergone brain surgery experience significant pain. This pain can have serious consequences including raised blood pressure, agitation, prolonged recovery time and an increased risk of long‐term headaches. Research studies have looked at different drugs in an attempt to reduce the risk of pain for these people. There is now more evidence about pain reduction options for adults undergoing brain surgery but there remains uncertainty as to which options work best. \\nThe question \\nThis review aimed to determine which drugs provide the best chance of reducing pain for adults undergoing brain surgery, by collecting and combining the results of studies that looked at pain‐relieving drugs for this patient group. To provide an accurate answer to this question, only studies conducted in accordance with an approved high standard were included. Studies published in different languages and countries were included in order to obtain as much information as possible. \\nIn addition to determining which drugs were best at preventing or reducing pain after brain surgery, this review attempted to determine additional information such as how much additional pain‐relieving treatment was required in addition to the treatment under study; whether participants' pain was adequately controlled or not; how drowsy the participants were; what side effects they experienced; and how long they needed to stay in intensive care and in hospital. This review also considered whether some treatments worked better when given before or after surgery or for people undergoing different approaches to brain surgery. \\nThe results \\nA total of 43 eligible studies, (42 complete and one still in progress), were found.

When only high‐quality studies were examined: NSAIDs reduced pain up to 24 hours after surgery, dexmedetomidine and local anaesthetics injected around specific scalp nerves reduced pain in the first 12 hours after surgery, pregabalin or gabapentin reduced pain in the first 6 hours after surgery and local anaesthetic injections around the surgical wound significantly reduced pain 48 hours after surgery, but did not affect pain at earlier time points. \\nWhen the timing of injection of local anaesthetics was examined, local anaesthetics injected around specific scalp nerves provided better early pain relief (first 6 hours) when injected after surgery and better late pain relief (12 and 24 hours) when injected before surgery. \\nThe following interventions were also found to reduce the need for additional pain‐relieving drugs: local anaesthetics injected around specific scalp nerves and dexmedetomidine. Gabapentin or pregabalin was found to reduce the risk of nausea and vomiting after surgery. \\nAcetaminophen was not found to prevent pain after brain surgery or reduce the need for additional pain‐relieving drugs. \\nInsufficient evidence was found to determine whether any of these drugs made the participants more or less drowsy, affected how long they needed to stay in intensive care or whether different drugs worked better for adults undergoing different approaches to brain surgery. \\nThe overall quality of the evidence that contributed to the results of this review was assessed and judged to be 'high' for pain‐reducing effects of NSAIDs, 'moderate' to 'low' for pain‐reducing effects of dexmedetomidine, acetaminophen, pregabalin and gabapentin and local anaesthetics injected around specific scalp nerves and ' low' to ' very low' for pain‐reducing effects of local anaesthetic injections around the surgical wound, additional pain relief requirements and risk of nausea and vomiting after surgery . \\n\", '10.1002-14651858.CD003737.pub4-abstract.txt': 'What are the benefits and risks of different treatments for intermittent exotropia (an eye co‐ordination problem that starts in childhood)? \\nKey messages \\n· Covering one eye with a patch improves the eye co‐ordination of children with intermittent exotropia more effectively than regular monitoring by an eye specialist. \\n· Few studies have compared other treatments for intermittent exotropia, and those that have do not provide clear answers about their benefits and risks. \\n· Well‐conducted studies are needed in this area to improve the management of intermittent exotropia. \\nWhat is intermittent exotropia? \\nIntermittent exotropia is an eye condition that develops in the first year of life. It causes one or both eyes to turn out toward the ear, typically when a child looks into the distance, daydreams, is tired, or is in bright sunlight. Only one eye turns out at a time, while the other eye points straight forwards. This can happen infrequently, or regularly throughout the day. \\nWhat treatments are available for intermittent exotropia? \\nRegular monitoring (observation) by an eye specialist may be all that is needed when a child’s eyes point in the same direction most of the time, or when intermittent exotropia does not affect vision. \\nFor children with more severe intermittent exotropia, several treatments are available, including: \\n· eye exercises, to improve a child’s control over their eye movements;\\n· glasses, to encourage the eyes to work together;\\n· eye muscle surgery, to adjust the position of the eyes; and\\n· covering one eye with a patch, to strengthen the other eye.\\nWhat did we want to find out? \\nWe wanted to find out:\\n· which treatment works best for intermittent exotropia; and\\n· whether treatments cause any unwanted (adverse) effects.\\nWhat did we do? \\nWe searched for studies that compared different treatments for intermittent exotropia against each other.

The studies compared: \\n· patching against observation (two studies); and\\n· different treatments involving surgery (four studies).\\nPatching compared to observation \\nThe evidence:\\n· shows that patching is better than observation for improving eye co‐ordination; and \\n· suggests that patching and observation may have similar effects on sharpness of near vision. \\nDifferent surgical procedures \\nThe evidence suggests that:\\n· surgery on the muscles that control the outward movement of both eyes is probably better for improving eye co‐ordination than surgery on the muscles that control both inward and outward movement in one eye; \\n· these two procedures may have similar effects on sharpness of near vision and quality of life, and may lead to similar numbers of adverse effects (such as small lumps under the skin); and \\n· there may be little to no difference in effect on eye co‐ordination when looking at distant objects between surgical procedures on the inside of the eye (‘plication’ and ‘resection’) when combined with surgery on the outside of the eye. \\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence? \\nThe evidence is based on a small number of studies, and several studies may have used methods likely to introduce errors in their results. In general, the studies provided limited information about the benefits and risks of different treatments for intermittent exotropia. For example, they often did not investigate adverse effects or effects on sharpness of vision at a distance and quality of life. \\nHow up‐to‐date is this evidence? \\nThe evidence is current to January 2021.\\n', '10.1002-14651858.CD012488.pub2-abstract.txt': \"Psychological therapies for anxiety and depression in children and adolescents with long‐term physical conditions \\nWhy is this review important? \\nMore than one in ten children and adolescents have long‐term physical conditions such as asthma, diabetes, and cancer.

We are moderately confident that knee arthroscopy probably does not provide any clinically important benefits in knee‐specific quality of life over a placebo procedure. Knee arthroscopy may not increase participant‐reported success compared with placebo. We have little confidence in the evidence because of differences across trials in reporting success and the small number of events. We are less certain of the risk of serious and total adverse events in arthroscopy versus placebo surgery: the evidence was uncertain because of the small number of events and incomplete reporting of study information. \\nAdverse events associated with surgery include total knee replacement, osteotomy, repeat arthroscopy, arthroscopy in opposite knee, cutaneous nerve lesion (damage to nerves in the skin), deep or superficial infection, general knee pain, swelling, instability, stiffness or decreased range of motion in the affected or opposite knee, haemarthrosis (bleeding into the knee joint), death, acute myocardial infarction (heart attack), hypoxaemia (decreased oxygen in the blood), deep vein thrombosis (blood clot in the deep veins), tendonitis (inflammation of tendons), pain from fall or other trauma, rupture of a Baker's cyst (a fluid‐filled sac behind the knee), and back or hip or foot pain. \\nArthroscopic surgery may or may not lead to slightly more subsequent knee surgery (replacement or osteotomy) than the placebo procedure. \\n\", '10.1002-14651858.CD015077-pls.txt': 'Spontaneous breathing activity in COVID‐19‐related lung failure\\nIs early spontaneous breathing beneficial in the treatment of lung failure in individuals with COVID‐19? \\nPeople with severe COVID‐19 can present with lung failure, which is called acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). This requires invasive mechanical ventilation through a breathing tube. It is possible to allow breathing, triggered by the patient (called spontaneous breathing), whilst being on a ventilator. However, it is unclear whether this is beneficial for such individuals, especially in the early phase of ventilation. \\nKey messages \\nWe found no evidence if spontaneous breathing is beneficial in the treatment of lung failure due to COVID‐19. \\nWhat are the advantages of early spontaneous breathing in ARDS?\\xa0 \\nThe advantage of spontaneous breathing during mechanical ventilation is the preserved movement of the diaphragm (the major muscle for breathing located under the lungs). It leads to better distribution of the inhaled air, especially in the pulmonary alveoli (small air sacs within the lungs) close to the diaphragm. In general, ventilation procedures with possible spontaneous breathing require lower doses of sedatives (which slow down brain activity). Since these can cause low blood pressure, it can additionally reduce the administration of cardiovascular medicines. \\nCan early spontaneous breathing be harmful in the treatment of ARDS? \\nDuring spontaneous breathing under mechanical ventilation, increased pressure fluctuations in the lungs may occur. Increased pressure difference within the lung is the main cause of ventilator‐associated lung injury. \\nWhat is the alternative to using early spontaneous breathing? \\nSpontaneous breathing may be suppressed by increased sedation or blockade of the nerves innervating muscles by medicines that allow for breathing (called neuromuscular blockade). The advantage of complete ventilator‐based breathing is a lower oxygen consumption of the muscles and the reduced risk of self‐inflicted lung injury. \\nWhat did we want to find out? \\nWe wanted to evaluate the benefits and harms of early spontaneous breathing activity in ventilated people with COVID‐19 with ARDS compared to ventilation strategies that avoid spontaneous breathing. \\nWhat did we do?\\xa0 \\nWe searched for studies that compared early spontaneous breathing during invasive mechanical ventilation with mandatory invasive ventilation and neuromuscular blockade in people with ARDS related to COVID‐19.

Possible side effects associated with GLA sourced from evening primrose oil include headache, nausea, and diarrhoea, and rare complications include allergy and seizures. \\nWhat is rheumatoid arthritis and what is herbal therapy? \\nWhen you have RA, your immune system, which normally fights infection, attacks the lining of your joints. This makes your joints swollen, stiff and painful. The small joints of your hands and feet are usually affected first. There is no cure for rheumatoid arthritis at present, so treatments are used to relieve pain and stiffness and improve your ability to move. \\nHerbal interventions are defined as any plant preparation (whole, powder, extract, standardised mixture) used for medicinal purposes. Historically, many herbal therapies have been used to treat RA. Like conventional non‐herbal drugs, many herbal therapies are believed to act by blocking the activity of these immune cells and substances and reducing inflammation in the joints, and some people believe they have fewer side effects.\\xa0 \\nBest estimate of what happens to people with rheumatoid arthritis:\\xa0 \\nPain (higher scores mean worse or more severe pain):\\n‐People who took eveing primrose oil, primrose oil, borage seed oil, or blackcurrent seed oil (wih the active ingredient GLA) rated their pain to be 33 points lower (9 to 56 points lower) on a scale of 0 to 100 after 6 months of treatment (33% absolute improvement). \\n‐People who took placebo rated their pain to be 19 points lower after treatment.\\nPhysical function (higher score means greater disability):\\n‐People who took GLA rated their disability 16% better.\\n‐People who placebo rated their disability 5% better.\\n', '10.1002-14651858.CD007263.pub3-abstract.txt': \"Dilute versus full‐strength formula in exclusively formula‐fed preterm or low birth weight infants \\nReview questionIs dilute formula milk (e.g. half the strength at double the volume) better tolerated than full‐strength formula milk in the initial feeding of preterm babies for whom breast milk is not available?\\xa0 \\nBackgroundBabies born preterm (at less than 37 weeks'\\xa0gestation) or with a low birth weight (less than 2500 grams) have special feeding requirements. Expressed breast milk is preferred, but preterm babies are often fed with formula milk because breast milk is not always available. The provision of artificial feeds varies considerably in preterm babies and there is concern that introducing full‐strength formulas too early may lead to the retention of feed in the stomach, which is associated with feeding intolerance and necrotising enterocolitis, a severe bowel disorder. \\nStudy characteristicsThe evidence for this review is current as of 1 October 2018. We included three trials that compared dilute formula milk (half‐strength, double‐volume) with full‐strength formula milk. The trials involved 102 preterm or low birth weight infants; two were conducted in the USA and one in India. The trials were small (14, 38 and 50 infants, respectively) and conducted between 25 and 30 years ago. The quality of two trials was judged to be poor due to insufficient information being provided in the trial publications, but judged to be moderate in the third trial (of 38 infants). None of the trials assessed necrotising enterocolitis\\xa0as an outcome. \\nKey resultsInfants receiving dilute formula (half‐strength, double‐volume) experienced fewer episodes of feeding intolerance and achieved full energy intake earlier than infants receiving full‐strength formula (20 kcal/oz (~ 68 to 70 kcal/100 mL)). \\nFeeding intoleranceTwo measures of feeding intolerance (abdominal distension and episodes of gastric residuals) were reported across the trials. Two trials (88 infants) provided data for\\xa0abdominal distension and gastric residuals. Infants fed dilute formula experienced 19% (CI 16% to 23%) fewer episodes of abdominal distension (> 2 cm), equivalent to 0.67 episodes per infant in the half‐strength group compared to 0.83 episodes in the full‐strength group. It was not possible to combine data on gastric residuals but both trials reported fewer episodes of gastric residuals in the dilute formula group. The third trial (14 infants) only reported that there was no difference between the groups with respect to these two outcomes. \\nTime to establish full enteral feedingIn two trials (88 infants) infants receiving dilute formula experienced a 22% (CI 16% to 28%) reduction in the number of days required to reach an adequate energy intake (420 joules/kilogram), equivalent to 8 days in the half‐strength group compared to 10.3 days in the full‐strength group. \\nCertainty of evidenceIn exclusively formula‐fed preterm or low birth weight infants, low‐certainty evidence shows that diluted formula may lead\\xa0to an important reduction in the time taken to attain adequate enteral fluid and energy requirements, without increasing indicators of feeding intolerance. The clinical importance of the reduction in episodes of feeding intolerance\\xa0is unclear. These findings are based on three small, old trials that may be of less relevance to current\\xa0practice. A lack of data on other important outcomes, such as the incidence of necrotising enterocolitis and weight gain, limits the usefulness of the studies. \\n\", '10.1002-14651858.CD013201.pub2-pls.txt': 'Stem cell‐based therapies for bleeding to the brain (germinal matrix‐intraventricular haemorrhage) in newborns born preterm \\nReview question \\nDo\\xa0stem cell‐based therapies save the lives or\\xa0improve the long‐term development of preterm newborns who have or may develop\\xa0bleeding to the brain (\"germinal matrix‐intraventricular haemorrhage\")? \\nBackground \\nNewborns born too early (\"preterm\"), especially\\xa0babies born\\xa0before\\xa028 weeks of pregnancy,\\xa0sometimes develop bleeding to the brain.\\xa0Babies with less severe bleeding may make a full recovery or may have only mild problems.

The aim of this Cochrane Review was to find out if school dental screening improves oral health of children; and if it does, which screening method works best. We found eight relevant studies to answer this question. This is the second update of a review that was published in December 2017 and first updated in August 2019. \\nKey message \\nThere is not enough evidence to draw conclusions about whether traditional school dental screening can improve dental attendance (can lead to children visiting the dentist more often). Moreover, it is not clear if improvement in dental attendance leads to better oral health. We still need high‐quality studies that measure the impact of screening on oral health over longer periods of time. \\nWhat did this review study? \\nOral diseases, especially tooth decay (called 'dental caries' by dentists), affect children worldwide. If untreated, oral health can deteriorate and negatively impact children's general well‐being. It also has a financial cost for families and society as a whole. \\nSchool dental screening involves a dental professional examining children's mouths and teeth at school and letting parents know about their child's oral condition and treatment needs. It aims to identify oral health concerns at an early stage and prompt parents to seek treatment where required. Whether this actually improves children's oral health is the question we wanted to answer in this review. \\nWhat were the main results of this review? \\nOur updated search identified one new study to be included since the last version of the review was published. In total, the review includes eight studies that presented results for 21,290 children. Four studies took place in the UK, two in India, one in the USA and one in Saudi Arabia. The children were 4 to 15 years old. Studies looked at the oral health and dental attendance of children who were screened in school compared to children who did not have screening. Some studies also compared different ways of screening and different forms of follow‐up (e.g. advice letter or referral). \\nWe do not know whether traditional school dental screening improves dental attendance. Studies looking at screening based on specific criteria (e.g. targeted at children not registered with a dentist) suggested it may be slightly more effective than no screening for improving attendance at the dentist. There may be\\xa0no difference between criteria‐based screening and universal screening for improving dental attendance, but we are very unsure about the results. \\nA personalised or specific referral letter to parents may improve dental attendance more than a non‐specific letter, but we are very unsure about the results. \\nScreening with added motivation (health education and offer of free treatment) may improve dental attendance compared to screening alone, but we are very unsure about the results. \\nOne study comparing different referral letters (with more or less information about dental diseases) found that neither was better than the other for improving dental treatment in children. \\nA specific referral letter did not encourage more parents to take their children to the dentist when compared to a letter with generic advice to visit the dentist. \\nThe eight studies followed up children for 3 to 11 months after they received screening. Therefore, we do not know the effects of screening over a longer period of time. \\nNone of the studies checked whether there were any negative effects of screening programmes or how much they cost. \\nHow up to date is the review? \\nWe searched for published studies up to 15 October 2021.\\n\", '10.1002-14651858.CD013376.pub2-pls.txt': \"Reducing aflatoxin intake with agricultural and nutritional education to improve growth of infants and children in low‐ and middle‐income countries \\nReview question \\nDoes providing agricultural and nutritional education about how to reduce the intake of aflatoxins (from contaminated food crops) in households and communities in low and middle‐income countries (LMICs) improve the growth of infants and children compared to usual or no education? \\nBackground \\nAflatoxins are toxins produced by moulds that contaminate food crops. Maize and groundnuts are the major dietary sources of aflatoxins, as they are eaten in large amounts by many people living in LMICs. Some research from LMICs suggests that there may be a link between aflatoxin intake during pregnancy and early childhood, and growth in infants and young children. \\nStudy Characteristics \\nWe included three trials, conducted in pregnant and breastfeeding women (1168 mother‐child pairs), women of childbearing age (N = 231), and infants and young children (< 59 months old), from rural, subsistence maize‐farming communities in Kenya, Tanzania, and Zimbabwe. One trial in Tanzania, at unclear risk of bias overall, provided data for this review, since one trial did not report any outcomes relevant to this review, and we were unable to obtain unpublished growth data for another, even after contacting the study authors. \\nThe trial, conducted in breastfeeding women and their babies, studied the effects of agricultural education (demonstrations to change farmers' practices after harvesting their maize crops to reduce aflatoxins (for example, by handsorting and de‐hulling the maize, using drying sheets and insecticides) on the babies' weight, standardised for age (weight‐for‐age z‐score (WAZ)), after six months (the z‐score measures the difference between these babies and the median of a population of similar babies). Farmers in the control group received routine services from agriculture extension workers. \\nKey results \\nVery low‐certainty evidence from one trial suggested that the WAZ of 128 children from farmers' households who received agricultural education may improve by a z‐score of 0.57, compared to 121 children from households where farmers only received routine services. This means that a baby girl in the intervention group, with a healthy weight, would gain about 450 to 690 grams more weight between three to nine months, compared to a baby girl in the control group. This is a meaningful difference. \\nAnother way of measuring the effect is to compare the proportion of underweight infants (WAZ ≥ 2 standard deviations below the reference median value) per group, after the intervention. In this case, agricultural education may reduce the proportion of underweight children, on average, by 6.7% (very low‐certainty evidence), compared to routine services. \\nNone of the included studies addressed the effects of nutritional education on length of height, or on unintended effects of agricultural or nutritional education. \\nEvidence about the effects on child growth of agricultural or nutritional education interventions that reduce aflatoxin exposure in LMICs was very limited. Data from one trial suggested that agricultural education, aimed at changing farmers' post‐harvest practices to reduce aflatoxin exposure, may result in the babies' increased weight‐for‐age, compared to usual or no education. \\nThe literature was searched to August 2019.\\nQuality of the evidence \\nWe have very little confidence in the results.

Diagnosis when the disease is still at an early stage (cancer is still within the womb, without spread into nearby tissues) is common, as most women with the disease experience abnormal vaginal bleeding and go to their doctors. However, delayed management of endometrial cancer still occurs. This is particularly a problem for women who are about to go through or are in the menopause. Providing educational information to women and healthcare providers regarding symptoms relating to endometrial cancer may raise awareness of the disease and reduce delayed treatment. We undertook this review to assess whether endometrial cancer education led to women with endometrial cancer symptoms visiting their doctors and being referred for treatment earlier than when there was no education. \\nThe aim of the review We undertook this review to assess whether endometrial cancer education led to women with endometrial cancer symptoms visiting their doctors and being referred for treatment earlier than when there was no educational information available. \\nMain findings We planned to include randomised controlled trials (studies in which people or groups of people are allocated by chance to two or more groups, treating them differently). In the absence of randomised controlled trials, we planned to include studies where participants were not randomised but that included an assessment of the benefits of health education compared to no health education. We searched scientific databases and checked the titles and abstracts of 4880 possibly relevant articles and assessed the full text of 16 of these references.

People with mild eczema have small patches of dry skin, and people with moderate eczema have larger, redder, or swollen areas of skin. People with severe eczema have red crusts and broken skin (which may ooze fluid) that develop all over the body. \\nAlthough there is currently no cure for eczema, treatments that aim to relieve symptoms are available. Usually, the first treatment option is to apply creams, ointments, or liquids to the affected skin. If this does not work, it is possible to take oral or injected (systemic) medicines that work throughout the body. \\nMany systemic medicines are available for eczema. To help people decide which one is most appropriate for managing their symptoms, we reviewed the evidence on benefits and risks of different systemic medicines for people with moderate or severe eczema. We particularly wanted to find out: \\n• whether some medicines were more likely than others to have an important positive effect on symptoms (defined as either at least a 75% improvement on the Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI), or improvement on the Patient‐Oriented Eczema Measure (POEM)—two scales that are used by clinicians to evaluate changes in eczema symptoms); and \\n• whether some medicines are associated with more serious unwanted events, including infection, than others. \\nHow we identified and assessed the evidence \\nFirst, we searched the medical literature for randomised controlled studies (studies where people are randomly divided into different treatment groups) because these studies provide the most robust evidence about the effects of a treatment. We then compared study results and summarised the evidence from all studies. Finally, we assessed how certain the evidence was. To do this, we considered factors such as the way studies were conducted, the size of studies, and the consistency of findings across studies. Based on our assessments, we categorised the evidence as being of very low, low, moderate, or high certainty. \\nWhat we found \\nWe found 74 studies that involved a total of 8177 people with moderate to severe eczema. Studies lasted between 2 weeks and 60 months. Treatments received varied from a single, one‐off dose to weekly doses for 60 months. These studies evaluated 29 different medicines by comparing them to a placebo (fake treatment) or to another medicine, or by comparing different doses of the same medicine. The medicine that was studied most frequently was dupilumab (12 studies), a laboratory‐made version of a protein, which blocks parts of the immune system involved in causing eczema. \\nDupilumab versus placebo \\nHigh‐certainty evidence shows that, compared to a placebo or other laboratory‐made proteins, dupilumab improves the symptoms of people with moderate to severe eczema in the short term (within 16 weeks of treatment). It is unclear whether this improvement is sustained after 16 weeks because no studies have looked at changes in POEM scores beyond that time, and because the evidence from studies that measured EASI scores was of very low certainty. Dupilumab may be associated with fewer serious unwanted events than placebo (low‐certainty evidence). \\nOther systemic medicines versus placebo \\nEvidence on the benefits and risks of other systemic medicines compared to placebo is limited because no studies have measured their effects on symptom improvement or serious unwanted effects, or because the certainty of the evidence is low or very low. \\nComparing different systemic medicines with one another \\nReviewers found too few studies that compared different systemic medicines against one another to determine which worked best for people with moderate to severe eczema. \\nWhat this means \\nEvidence shows that, compared to placebo, dupilumab improves the symptoms of people with moderate to severe eczema within 16 weeks of treatment and may be associated with fewer serious unwanted events. \\nReviewers found too few robust studies to conclude whether dupilumab improves symptoms beyond 16 weeks, or whether this medicine works better than older systemic medicines. Future studies need to compare different systemic treatments beyond 16 weeks in people with moderate to severe eczema. \\nHow up‐to‐date is this review? \\nThe evidence in this Cochrane Review is current to August 2019.\\n', '10.1002-14651858.CD013194-pls.txt': \"How accurate is visual inspection of skin lesions with the naked eye for diagnosis of melanoma in adults? \\nWhat is the aim of the review? \\nMelanoma is one of the most dangerous forms of skin cancer. The aim of this Cochrane Review was to find out how accurate checking suspicious skin lesions (lumps, bumps, wounds, scratches or grazes) with the naked eye (visual inspection) can be to diagnose melanoma (diagnostic accuracy). The Review also investigated whether diagnostic accuracy was different depending on whether the clinician was face to face with the patient (in‐person visual inspection), or looked at an image of the lesion (image‐based visual inspection). Cochrane researchers included 19 studies to answer this question. \\nWhy is it important to know the diagnostic accuracy of visual examination of skin lesions suspected to be melanomas? \\nNot recognising a melanoma when it is present (a false‐negative test result) delays surgery to remove it (excision), risking cancer spreading to other organs in the body and possibly death. Diagnosing a skin lesion (a mole or area of skin with an unusual appearance in comparison with the surrounding skin) as a melanoma when it is not (a false‐positive result) may result in unnecessary surgery, further investigations, and patient anxiety. Visual inspection of suspicious skin lesions by a clinician using the naked eye is usually the first of a series of ‘tests’ to diagnose melanoma. Knowing the diagnostic accuracy of visual inspection alone is important to decide whether additional tests, such as a biopsy (removing a part of the lesion for examination under a microscope) are needed to improve accuracy to an acceptable level. \\nWhat did the review study? \\nResearchers wanted to find out the diagnostic accuracy of in‐person compared with image‐based visual inspection of suspicious skin lesions. Researchers also wanted to find out whether diagnostic accuracy was improved if doctors used a 'visual inspection checklist' or depending on how experienced in visual inspection they were (level of clinical expertise). They considered the diagnostic accuracy of the first visual inspection of a lesion, for example, by a general practitioner (GP), and of lesions that had been referred for further evaluation, for example, by a dermatologist (doctor specialising in skin problems). \\nWhat are the main results of the review? \\nOnly 19 studies (17 in‐person studies and 2 image‐based studies) were clear whether the test was the first visual inspection of a lesion or was a visual inspection following referral (for example, when patients are referred by a GP to skin specialists for visual inspection). \\nFirst in‐person visual inspection (3 studies) \\nThe results of three studies of 1339 suspicious skin lesions suggest that in a group of 1000 lesions, of which 90 (9%) actually are melanoma: \\n‐ An estimated 268 will have a visual inspection result indicating melanoma is present. Of these, 185 will not be melanoma and will result in an unnecessary biopsy (false‐positive results). \\n‐ An estimated 732 will have a visual inspection result indicating that melanoma is not present. Of these, seven will actually have melanoma and would not be sent for biopsy (false‐negative results). \\nTwo further studies restricted to 4228 suspicious skin lesions that were all selected to be excised found similar results. \\nIn‐person visual inspection after referral, all lesions selected to be excised (8 studies) \\nThe results of eight studies of 5331 suspicious skin lesions suggest that in a group of 1000 lesions, of which 90 (9%) actually are melanoma: \\n‐ An estimated 108 will have a visual inspection result indicating melanoma is present, and of these, 39 will not be melanoma and will result in an unnecessary biopsy (false‐positive results). \\n‐ Of the 892 lesions with a visual inspection result indicating that melanoma is not present, 21 will actually be melanoma and would not be sent for biopsy (false‐negative results). \\nOverall, the number of false‐positive results (diagnosing a skin lesion as a melanoma when it is not) was observed to be higher and the number of false‐negative results (not recognising a melanoma when it is present) lower for first visual inspections of suspicious skin lesions compared to visual inspection following referral. \\nVisual inspection of images of suspicious skin lesions (2 studies) \\nAccuracy was much lower for visual inspection of images of lesions compared to visual inspection in person. \\nValue of visual inspection checklists \\nThere was no evidence that use of a visual inspection checklist or the level of clinical expertise changed diagnostic accuracy. \\nHow reliable are the results of the studies of this review? \\nThe majority of included studies diagnosed melanoma by lesion biopsy and confirmed that melanoma was not present by biopsy or by follow‐up over time to make sure the skin lesion remained negative for melanoma. In these studies, biopsy, clinical follow‐up, or specialist clinician diagnosis were the reference standards (means of establishing final diagnoses). Biopsy or follow‐up are likely to have been reliable methods for deciding whether patients really had melanoma. In a few studies, experts diagnosed the absence of melanoma (expert diagnosis), which is less likely to have been a reliable method for deciding whether patients really had melanoma. There was lots of variation in the results of the studies in this review and the studies did not always describe fully the methods they used, which made it difficult to assess their reliability. \\nWho do the results of this review apply to? \\nThirteen studies were undertaken in Europe (68%), with the remainder undertaken in Asia (n = 1), Oceania (n = 4), and North America (n = 1). Mean age ranged from 30 to 73.6 years (reported in 10 studies). The percentage of individuals with melanoma ranged between 4% and 20% in first visualised lesions and between 1% and 50% in studies of referred lesions. In the majority of studies, the lesions were unlikely to be representative of the range of those seen in practice, for example, only including skin lesions of a certain size or with a specific appearance. In addition, variation in the expertise of clinicians performing visual inspection and in the definition used to decide whether or not melanoma was present across studies makes it unclear as to how visual inspection should be carried out and by whom in order to achieve the accuracy observed in studies. \\nWhat are the implications of this review? \\nError rates from visual inspection are too high for it to be relied upon alone. Although not evaluated in this review, other technologies need to be used to ensure accurate diagnosis of skin cancer. There is considerable variation and uncertainty about the diagnostic accuracy of visual inspection alone for the diagnosis of melanoma. There is no evidence to suggest that visual inspection checklists reliably improve the diagnostic accuracy of visual inspection, so recommendations cannot be made about when they should be used. Despite the existence of numerous research studies, further, well‐reported studies assessing the diagnostic accuracy of visual inspection with and without visual inspection checklists and by clinicians with different levels of expertise are needed. \\nHow up‐to‐date is this review? \\nThe review authors searched for and used studies published up to August 2016.\\n\", '10.1002-14651858.CD015397-pls.txt': 'Unintended consequences of school‐based measures to manage the COVID‐19 pandemic\\nWhy is this question important? \\nCountries worldwide have taken many public health and social measures to prevent and control the spread of SARS‐CoV‐2, a highly contagious respiratory virus responsible for COVID‐19. A range of measures have been put in place to minimise transmission of SARS‐CoV‐2 within schools and the wider community. Schools have the potential to be settings of high viral transmission because they involve extended interactions amongst people in close proximity.\\xa0A previous review located and examined studies on the effectiveness of such school‐based measures regarding SARS‐CoV‐2 transmission. It is equally important to look at their unintended consequences on health and society in order that policymakers and parents can make informed decisions.\\xa0Unintended consequences of a public health measure may be beneficial or harmful (or a mix of both).\\xa0A public health measure may result in a mix of benefits and harms. For this review, we planned to examine the unintended consequences of measures designed to prevent and control the spread of SARS‐CoV‐2 in schools. This review can therefore be seen as complementing the previous review on the effectiveness of such measures.\\xa0 \\xa0 \\nWhat did we do? \\nFirstly, we searched nine databases for studies that assessed any measure put in place in the school settings (primary or secondary schools, or both) to prevent transmission of the virus. We considered all types of studies and a broad range of outcomes. \\nSecondly, we grouped the identified studies according to the types of measures they examined. We then described which approaches were used in the studies, where these were conducted, and which unintended consequences were evaluated.\\xa0 \\nWhat did we find? \\nWe found 18 studies that matched our inclusion criteria. Five studies used ‘real‐life’ data (observational studies); five studies used data generated by a computer and based on a set of assumptions (modelling studies); three studies were experimental studies (e.g. laboratory‐based); and four studies used qualitative methods, meaning they based their findings on interviews with people. One study used mixed methods, combining numerical and non‐numerical (qualitative) information.\\xa0 \\nStudies examined four different types of measures, as follows.\\n‐ Measures to reduce contacts (4 studies): policies to reduce the number of students in the school building (i.e. reducing the number of students present per class) and/or to reduce the number of contacts of students (e.g. through defined groups or staggered arrival, breaks, and departures). \\n‐ Measures to make contacts safer (14 studies): practices to ensure safer contacts between people in the school and classroom setting (e.g. mask mandates or distancing regulations), to modify the environment or activities (e.g. enhanced cleaning or ventilation practices). \\n‐ Surveillance and response measures to detect SARS‐CoV‐2 infections (6 studies): testing and/or screening strategies (e.g. temperature taking, screening tests for students and staff, and testing of symptomatic students and staff) and self‐isolation or quarantine measures. \\n‐ Multicomponent measures (1 study): interventions using a combination of at least two of the above measures. \\nWe looked at the following unintended outcomes.\\n‐ Educational consequences (11 studies), e.g. changes in school performance, advancement to the next grade, or change in graduation numbers. \\n‐ Psychosocialoutcomes\\xa0(7 studies), e.g. mental health, anxieties about going to school. \\n‐ Physical health and health behaviour outcomes beyond COVID‐19 (3 studies), e.g. hand eczema due to increased handwashing. \\n‐ Environmental consequences (3 studies), e.g. changes in air quality in classrooms. \\n‐ Socio‐economic consequences (2 studies), e.g. economic burden on families.\\xa0 \\nWhat did we conclude? \\nWe identified a wide range of unintended consequences of school‐based measures designed to prevent the spread of SARS‐CoV‐2. However, the evidence base is small, and there are large gaps where more research is needed. This scoping review is a first step in gauging the extent of those consequences. More research is needed\\xa0to collect additional information and to enable a more thorough analysis of the evidence. Psychosocial consequences (e.g. mental health issues, depression, loneliness) and equity and equality consequences (e.g. disadvantages for children from low‐income households, unfair distribution of work between genders for parents, are in need of further attention. We recommend that future research look at interventions such as fixed groups, alternating physical presence at school and staggered arrival departure and break times, as well as testing and quarantine measures.\\xa0 \\nHow up to date is this evidence? \\nThe evidence is up to date to\\xa0March 2021.\\n', '10.1002-14651858.CD004508.pub4-abstract.txt': \"Early versus delayed feeding for reducing complications after gynaecologic surgery\\nReview Question \\nWhat are the risks and benefits of eating food early, versus delaying food for at least 24 hours after abdominal gynaecologic surgery? \\nBackground \\nPhysicians often delay giving food and drink to women after abdominal gynaecologic surgery (uterine fibroids, endometriosis, ovarian cysts, uterine and ovarian cancer) until bowel function recommences (typically 24 hours after surgery). This is to reduce the risk of complications such as vomiting, gastrointestinal disruptions and wound rupturing or leakage. However, it has been suggested that some women may recover more quickly if food is introduced earlier. We reviewed evidence from randomised controlled trials of early and delayed feeding after abdominal gynaecologic surgery. \\nStudy Characteristics \\nWe assessed evidence on the following outcomes:\\n1. Nausea, vomiting, cramping abdominal pain, bloating, abdominal distension, wound complication, deep venous thrombosis, urinary tract infection, pneumonia. \\n2. Time to first: bowel sound, gas, stool, start of regular diet.\\n3. Length of hospital stay\\nEarly feeding was defined as having fluids or food within 24 hours of surgery. Delayed feeding was defined as having fluids or food 24 hours after surgery, and only if there are bowel sounds, passage of gas or stool, and a feeling of hunger. \\nThe evidence is current to April 2014\\nKey Results \\nWe included five published studies of 631 women, mainly with gynaecologic cancer.\\nRecovery of bowel function was faster in those with early feeding. There was no difference in rates of nausea or vomiting, abdominal distension, need for a postoperative nasogastric tube or time to first bowel movement, but early feeding was associated with a shorter time to bowel sounds and onset of gas. The early feeding group resumed a solid diet 1½ days sooner than those having delayed feeding and the hospital stay was one day shorter. Also, the early feeding group were more satisfied with the feeding schedule, although only one study reported this. \\nEarly feeding appeared safe, without increased postoperative complications and with fewer infectious complications overall. \\nQuality of the Evidence \\nMost of the evidence was moderate quality. The main limitation was lack of blinding, which could influence the findings for subjective outcomes such as self‐reported symptoms, hospital stay, patients' satisfaction and quality of life. \\nConclusions \\nThe evidence suggests that eating and drinking on the first day after abdominal gynaecologic surgery is safe and could reduce the length of hospital stay. \\n\", '10.1002-14651858.CD010382.pub2-abstract.txt': \"Non‐drug management of breathing problems for children with severe physical and intellectual impairment \\nBackground For a variety of reasons, some children live with very severe intellectual and physical problems; they are unable to walk or talk and require a lot of care. In this study we refer to them as children with severe global developmental delay (SGDD); this is not a specific diagnosis but is rather an 'umbrella term' used to describe a group of children with similar problems. These children may have weak or stiff muscles and deformities of their skeleton; often they have problems with swallowing, resulting in food or saliva going into their lungs. Frequently they have a poor cough reflex and lack the strength required to expel secretions when they do cough. When we sleep, our breathing becomes shallower; for some children with SGDD whose breathing is already shallow when awake, falling asleep means that they do not breathe sufficiently deeply to take in enough oxygen and breathe out enough carbon dioxide. The consequence of these problems is that their respiratory system becomes weakened; they are more likely to develop chest infections, and relatively minor infections can make them very unwell. This can result in their spending a lot of time in hospital. This affects the quality of life for these children and families and is very expensive. Many types of treatment could help, but no good summary of studies has been prepared to tell healthcare professionals which treatments are best and when they should be used; this is the reason for this review. \\nReview question The aim of our review was to discover how effective each type of treatment is for managing breathing problems in children with severe global developmental delay. As so many treatments are available, we decided to look only at treatments that do not involve drugs. \\nStudy characteristics We carried out a wide database search to look for studies of interventions for the management of breathing problems in children with severe neurological impairment. We found 15 studies of interest, which included a number of different types of treatment. \\nKey results The results showed that several different treatments provided potential benefits, and for most interventions no serious adverse effects were reported. However, the quality of the studies was not good enough to inspire confidence in the findings. Night‐time positioning equipment and spinal bracing were shown to have a potentially negative effect in some participants. Although some studies looked at the same type of treatment, they used it in different ways or used different measures to assess effectiveness, so we could not put the results together. \\nQuality of the evidence Of the 15 studies included here, only four used the 'gold standard' study design for health interventions. The remainder of the studies used less robust study designs, which limits the strength of the results. Further well‐designed randomised studies including larger numbers of participants are required to guide healthcare professionals to select the most effective treatments. \\nThis plain‐language summary is current to November 2013.\\xa0 We updated searches in November 2019 and July 2020 and added six studies to awaiting classification, but these results have not been fully incorporated into the review. \\n\", '10.1002-14651858.CD013196.pub2-pls.txt': \"Telehealth technologies for people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)\\nReview question \\nDo telehealth technologies help improve the health of people who have COPD?\\nBackground \\nChronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) includes a group of lung conditions that cause breathing difficulties. Symptoms include shortness of breath (dyspnoea), coughing, and increased mucus. COPD causes limited airflow in the lungs when breathing out; this can be measured by spirometry (a measure to assess how well the lungs function). The spirometer takes two measurements: volume of air when breathing out forcefully in one second, and total amount of air breathed out. When COPD gets worse over time, this leads to greater symptom severity and can reduce quality of life. Disease progression and sudden flare‐ups (exacerbations) of symptoms can increase someone's risks of hospitalisation and death. Telehealth technologies could improve delivery of health care for people with COPD, which could reduce exacerbations, improve quality of life, and lower rates of hospitalisation. However, it is unclear whether providing telehealth care improves health‐related outcomes for people with COPD. We wanted to explore whether telehealth technologies were helpful for people with COPD. \\nWhat are telehealth technologies? \\nStudy investigators used a range of telehealth technologies. Some included remote monitoring technology, which requires daily use of a laptop or a tablet with monitoring equipment, with results received by the healthcare professional. Typical monitoring equipment included a stethoscope (to measure blood pressure and heart rate), a pulse oximeter (to measure oxygen levels in the blood), a spirometer (to measure lung function), a thermometer, and other devices. Interventions involved regular phone calls with healthcare professionals for patients to talk about their symptoms and completion of health questionnaires. \\nIdentifying and selecting studies \\nWe searched online databases up until April 2020. We searched for studies published worldwide, in any language, at any time. Two review authors looked at lists of studies separately, then agreed on which studies should be included. \\nTo find the best answer to our question, we looked for studies that recruited people with COPD of any severity. To make the comparison fair, we looked for studies in which investigators compared remote monitoring, remote monitoring plus usual care, and multi‐component treatments. People included in these studies had to have the same random chance (like the flip of a coin) to receive one of these teleheath technologies or usual care. \\nKey results \\nWe found 29 studies (5654 people with moderate to very severe COPD) that were suitable for inclusion in our review. Duration of these studies ranged from 3 to 12 months. \\nWe did not find any important benefits or harms for patients who were monitored with any of the telehealth technologies when we looked at number of exacerbations, improvement in quality of life, and reduction in breathing distress symptoms, hospitalisations, or death. However, people who were monitored through telehealth technology plus usual care had some reduction in risk of hospital re‐admission. Thus, telehealth technologies that were part of a care package reduced COPD‐related hospital re‐admissions. \\nWe could not be certain of any harms of stand‐alone remote monitoring. We are also uncertain of any benefits or harms of stand‐alone remote monitoring of patient experiences or reports of breathing distress. \\nQuality of evidence \\nCurrently, no good quality evidence is available. We are very uncertain about evidence for exacerbations, quality of life, dyspnoea symptoms, hospitalisations, deaths, and side effects. However, we are moderately certain about our findings for hospital re‐admissions. \\nConclusion \\nWe are not clear whether telehealth technologies for monitoring or consultation provide benefit, but we have not found any information on harms. Telehealth could play a role in the care and management of people with COPD. Telehealth as part of multi‐component care packages may provide short‐term benefit for quality of life and hospital re‐admissions. Telehealth in the form of remote monitoring in addition to usual care may reduce the risk of hospital re‐admission. There is little impact on exacerbations, quality of life, and death. Owing to limited information, the findings of this review should be interpreted with caution. More studies are needed to determine whether telehealth provides any long‐term benefits for people with COPD of varying severity. \\n\", '10.1002-14651858.CD012948-abstract.txt': \"Planned birth at or near term for improving health outcomes for pregnant women with pre‐existing diabetes and their infants \\nWhat is the issue? \\nThe aim of this Cochrane review was to find out if planning an elective birth at or near the term of pregnancy, compared to waiting for labour to start spontaneously, has an impact on the health of women with diabetes and the health of their babies. This review focuses on women who have diabetes before becoming pregnant (pre‐existing diabetes). Elective birth is carried out either by induction of labour or caesarean section, and 'at or near term' means 37 to 40 weeks' gestation. \\nTo answer this question, we searched for all relevant studies (date of search: 15 August 2017), with the aim of collecting and analysing them together. \\nWhy is this important? \\nWhen women with diabetes (Type 1 or Type 2) become pregnant they are at higher risk of complications than women who do not have diabetes. For example, their babies may be larger and have a higher risk of death in the later weeks of pregnancy. Because of these risks, many clinicians have recommended that women with diabetes have an elective birth (usually by induction) at or near term (37 to 40 weeks' gestation), rather than waiting for labour to start spontaneously or until 41 weeks' gestation if all is well. Induction has the disadvantage of increasing the incidence of forceps or ventouse births, and women often find it difficult to cope with an induced labour. Caesarean section is a major operation which can lead to blood loss, infections and increased chance of problems with subsequence births. Early birth can increase the chance of breathing problems for babies. It is important to know which approach to birth has a better impact on the health outcomes of women with pre‐existing diabetes and their babies. \\nWhat evidence did we find? \\nWe found no studies that addressed our specific question.\\nWhat does this mean? \\nIn the absence of randomised studies, we are unable to say if women with pre‐existing diabetes and their babies experience better health outcomes if they have a planned birth (by induction of labour or caesarean section at 37 to 40 weeks' gestation) compared to waiting for labour to begin spontaneously or until 41 weeks' gestation if all is well.

Standard therapy consists of surgery and chemotherapy. Responses to chemotherapy are generally good; however, most women experience relapse, for which no curative treatment is available. The presence of certain immune cells in tumours is associated with longer survival. This suggests that stimulation of anti‐tumour immune responses (i.e. immunotherapy) might be a useful approach for improving outcomes among women with ovarian cancer. \\nReview question This review evaluated the feasibility of antigen‐specific active immunotherapy. Antigen‐specific active immunotherapy aims to induce anti‐tumour immune responses through administration of a tumour antigen ‐ a molecule that is expressed by tumour cells and is hardly expressed by healthy cells. Reviewers collected information on clinical outcomes, immunological responses, and side effects. \\nMain findings We identified 67 studies, which included 3632 women with ovarian cancer and were published between 1966 and 2017. The most frequently described strategy was administration of antibodies targeting the tumour antigen CA‐125 (2347 participants in 17 studies). Most of these studies primarily evaluated safety and immunological responses. Severe flu‐like and gastrointestinal symptoms occurred in 7% to 30% of participants. Researchers frequently detected antibodies and immune cells recognising the tumour antigen CA‐125, albeit response rates varied between studies. Despite these promising immunological responses, four large studies reported no survival advantage for participants treated with CA‐125‐directed antibody over those given placebo. \\nFor strategies not relying on antibody administration, similar conclusions cannot yet be drawn. Overall, study authors report that treatment was well tolerated and inflammatory side effects at the injection site were most frequently observed. Researchers observed responses of the immune system for most strategies studied, but the clinical benefit of these strategies remains to be evaluated in large trials. \\nCertainty of the evidence and conclusions Because no high‐certainty evidence of clinical benefit is currently available, antibody therapy targeting CA‐125 should not be incorporated into standard treatment in its current form. \\nBased on lack of uniformity in included studies, we strongly advocate universal adoption of response definitions, guidelines for adverse events reporting, and directives for trial conduct and reporting. Furthermore, results from ongoing randomised controlled trials (RCTs) are awaited, and further RCTs should be conducted. \\n', '10.1002-14651858.CD013790.pub2-pls.txt': 'Do heated tobacco products help people to quit smoking, are they safe for this purpose, and have they led to falls in smoking rates? \\nKey messages \\nHeated tobacco probably exposes people to fewer toxins than cigarettes, but possibly more than not using any tobacco. Falls in cigarette sales appeared to speed up following the launch of heated tobacco in Japan, but we are uncertain whether this is caused by people switching from cigarettes to heated tobacco. \\nWe need more independently funded research into whether heated tobacco helps people stop smoking, whether it results in unwanted effects, and the impact of rising heated tobacco use on smoking rates.\\xa0 \\nWhat are heated tobacco products?\\xa0 \\nHeated tobacco products are designed to heat tobacco to a high enough temperature to release vapour, without burning it or producing smoke. They differ from e‐cigarettes because they heat tobacco leaf/sheet rather than a liquid. Many of the harmful chemicals in cigarette smoke are created by burning tobacco. So heating not burning tobacco could reduce the amount of chemicals a user ingests. Some people report stopping smoking cigarettes entirely by switching to using heated tobacco. \\nWhy we did this Cochrane Review\\xa0 \\nBecause cigarette smoking is addictive, many people find it difficult to stop despite the harm it causes. We aimed to find out whether trying to switch to heated tobacco helps people stop smoking cigarettes, and whether it results in unwanted effects. We also wanted to find out whether rising heated tobacco use has affected smoking rates or cigarette sales. \\nWhat did we do? \\nWe looked for studies that reported on the use of heated tobacco for stopping smoking, and on unwanted effects and toxin exposure in people asked to use heated tobacco. Here we only included randomised controlled trials, where treatments were given to people at random. This type of study is considered the most reliable way of determining if a treatment works. Finally, we searched for studies looking at changes in smoking rates and cigarette sales following the launch of heated tobacco to market. We included studies published up to January 2021. \\nWhat we found \\nOur search found 13 relevant studies. No studies reported whether heated tobacco helps people stop smoking cigarettes. Eleven trials, all funded by tobacco companies and with 2666 adult smokers, compared unwanted effects and toxin levels in people randomly assigned to use heated tobacco or to continue smoking cigarettes or abstain from tobacco use. \\nTwo studies looked at how trends in cigarette sales changed following the launch of heated tobacco in Japan. \\nWhat are the results of our review?\\xa0 \\nWe do not know whether using heated tobacco helps people to stop smoking cigarettes (no studies measured this). \\nWe are uncertain whether the chances of getting unwanted symptoms from being asked to use heated tobacco are different compared with cigarettes (6 studies, 1713 participants) or no tobacco (2 studies, 237 participants). Serious unwanted symptoms in the short time period studied (average 13 weeks)\\xa0were rare in all groups, which means we are uncertain about any differences. Toxin levels were probably lower in people using heated tobacco than those smoking cigarettes (10 studies, 1959 participants), but may be higher than in people not using any tobacco products (5 studies, 382 participants). \\nThe launch of heated tobacco products in Japan may have caused the decline in cigarette sales to speed up over time (two studies), but it is unclear whether the fall in the percentage of people who smoke also sped up because no studies looked at this.\\xa0 \\nHow reliable are these results? \\nResults are based on data from a small number of studies, most of which were funded by tobacco companies.\\xa0 \\nResults on unwanted effects are likely to change as more evidence becomes available. However, we are moderately confident that levels of measured toxins are lower in people using heated tobacco than smoking cigarettes, but less confident that levels were higher than in people not using any tobacco. We are also less confident that the launch of heated tobacco caused the fall in cigarette sales to speed up, as results came from a single country. \\n', '10.1002-14651858.CD011106.pub2-abstract.txt': 'The usefulness of protocols for reducing the time newborn infants spend on mechanical ventilation in the neonatal intensive care unit \\nReview question \\nAre protocols useful for reducing the time newborn infants spend on mechanical ventilation in the neonatal intensive care unit?  Background \\nMechanical ventilation is used to help newborns to breath when they are too sick or born too premature to breath on their own. However, mechanical ventilation is not without risk, and can cause (permanent) damage to the lungs. For example, the pressure needed to fill the lungs with air may destroy the very fragile air sacs, and result in scaring of the lungs. For this reason, it is important to recognize when a newborn is mature and strong enough to start breathing for himself/herself, and to reduce (wean) the ventilator support. There is, unfortunately, no current agreement on the best way to wean newborns off the ventilator. Researchers have studied the usefulness of standardized protocols to guide the process of weaning off the ventilator in adults and children. In adults, 17 studies of weaning protocols have shown benefit in helping the doctors and nurses wean adults off the ventilator in a safe and timely manner. In children, three studies of weaning protocols have shown they are beneficial in reducing time on the ventilator, but the studies were too few to show harms. As yet, we do not know if weaning protocols in neonates provide benefits or harms. However, these standardized protocols have supplied us with firm evidence for their usefulness in weaning from mechanical ventilation in the care of children.  Study characteristics \\nThe purpose of this review was to look at weaning protocol studies in newborn infants to see if we could draw conclusions on their usefulness for weaning practice in neonatal care.

Because some of the locations are difficult to reach, some of the tumour may be left behind, even after aggressive surgery. When this happens, radiation to the postoperative area can help reduce the chance of the tumour coming back. Given the closeness to the spinal cord and other important organs, special radiation techniques are required to maximise tumour control, while minimising harm to normal tissues in the body. \\nWhy is this review important?At the time of this review, there is a lack of evidence to confirm a benefit with proton therapy compared to conventional photon radiation treatment. However, it is important to note that this review found a number of delivery techniques for both proton and photon therapy. As evidence comparing the latest techniques for proton and photon therapy emerges, we will update this review. \\nThe aim of the review:The aim of this Cochrane Review was to find out whether proton therapy is more effective than photon therapy for improving local control, and reducing mortality, recurrence, and treatment‐related toxicity. We collected and analysed all relevant studies to answer this question. \\nWhat are the main findings?We included six studies that enrolled 187 adults with chordoma, four of which we included in a meta‐analysis. We are uncertain whether proton radiation therapy compared to conventional photon radiation treatment improves local control, because our confidence in the evidence was very low (2 observational studies, 39 participants). We are uncertain whether proton therapy compared to photon therapy reduces mortality (4 observational studies, 65 participants), recurrence (4 observational studies, 94 participants), or treatment‐related toxicity (1 observational study, 33 participants). \\nQuality of the Evidence:We found very low‐certainty evidence for all outcomes due to high risk of bias in all the included observational studies, very small sample sizes, and varying ranges in the duration of participants' follow‐up period between studies. \\nAuthors' conclusions:From the currently available evidence, we do not know if proton therapy, used for adults with chordoma, is associated with clinically appreciable benefits and acceptable harms. \\nThe existing research on this question is solely of non‐randomised design, and is underpowered, with substantial imprecision.

Between 80% and 90% of people with CF are not able to produce enough pancreatic enzymes to breakdown and absorb fat, protein and fat‐soluble vitamins from food. This can lead to fatty stools (poo) and weight loss. It is thought that if fat is not digested properly, it could contribute to a higher risk of developing constipation or other serious gut complications such as distal intestinal obstruction syndrome. \\nPERT provides the enzymes required to breakdown fat and the dosage is based upon the fat content of a meal or the person's body weight. PERT has been shown to improve weight and is associated with improved lung function. Despite current dose guidance, there are differences in PERT doses and there is no set guidance for when the therapy should be taken in relation to a meal (i.e. before, during or after eating). \\nSearch date \\nThe evidence is current to: 24 June 2021.\\nStudy characteristics \\nWe did not find any studies where PERT was given to people with CF who were pancreatic insufficient at different timings relative to their meals. We excluded nine studies. Four of these assessed the timing of PERT administration, but they had a cross‐over design where participants had\\xa0one intervention and then swapped to the second intervention. We excluded these studies because they did not leave enough time between the different interventions to be sure that the effects of the first intervention were not affecting the results from the second intervention.

One study was terminated early and we will assess this again at the first update of this review if we are able to obtain more information from the investigators. \\nKey results \\nNo studies met the eligibility criteria.

Lung cancer survival is significantly dependent on when a person is diagnosed with the disease. It is essential to detect the disease as early as possible by radiography (chest x‐ray) or by computed tomography (CT) scan, which is a more detailed type of radiography where multiple images of the lung are taken. The aim of this review was to gather information on the use of CT scan to detect lung cancer earlier and to find out if early detection of lung cancer reduces death from lung cancer. We also evaluated potential harms that can occur from using CT to screen for lung cancer, such as additional investigations and their related complications. \\nDescription of included trials \\nThe evidence is current to 31 July 2021. We included 11 trials, with a total of 94,445 participants. The trials came from the USA and Europe. The earliest trial started in 1991, and the most recent started in 2011. The participants were adults over the age of 40. The frequency of screening with CT ranged from yearly to more than 2.5 years. \\nKey findings \\nEight of the trials (91,122 participants) were included in the main outcome analysis of lung cancer‐related mortality. In people over 40 years with significant smoking exposure, CT screening reduced deaths from lung cancer by 21%, with 226 people needing to undergo screening to prevent one death from lung cancer. We also found that deaths from any cause (including lung cancer) were less with CT screening. However, the effect was much lower (only 5% reduction in risk).\\xa0Lung cancer was detected more frequently in the group of people who had CT screening compared with no screening. However, CT scans can induce\\xa0false‐positive scans (a test that is positive or indeterminate for lung cancer, when the person does not actually have lung cancer). We found that false‐positive results were more common among people who were screened with CT than chest x‐ray. Because of that, those that underwent CT screening had more tests to investigate both cancer and non‐cancer‐related diseases. Screening also implies a risk of detecting lung cancers that may have never progressed to cause harm to the person (this is referred to as overdiagnosis). The risk of lung cancer overdiagnosis with CT screening was estimated to be 18%. \\nThe trials were too different or did not provide enough information to look at the impact of screening on stopping smoking or quality of life. There was some evidence to suggest there were no long‐term psychological harms from screening, with some people in the CT screening group feeling less anxious compared to the control groups who were not offered screening. \\nCertainty of evidence \\nThe overall certainty of evidence was moderate when it came to outcomes regarding death, with moderate‐ to low‐certainty evidence for other outcomes.

Examples of such tools are\\xa0track and trigger systems or early warning systems kept by the bedside in maternity care. \\nWhy is this important? \\nMany natural functional changes occur in a woman's body during pregnancy. As a result, a pregnant woman, who may appear healthy and well, can become rapidly very sick. This is called clinical deterioration. If not detected sufficiently early and treated successfully, the pregnant woman can become seriously ill or even die. Examples are serious bleeding, development of convulsions when a woman has high blood pressure, blood clots and serious infection. Simple bedside tools or charts can be used by maternity care providers (midwives and doctors) to record information on a woman's health. The recorded health measures include her blood pressure, pulse rate, breathing rate, body temperature, and other health measures such as urine output and mental alertness. The tools have been introduced so that the measures are observed, recorded and interpreted together, rather than as single measures. The intention is to detect when serious illness is, or might be developing. Medical staff can then step in to prevent serious harm.\\xa0 \\nWhat evidence did we find? \\nWe searched for evidence on 28 May 2021 and identified two studies that compared an early warning system with standard care. One study was a single‐centre study involving 700 women and the second was a stepped‐wedge cluster trial (multiple centres grouped into 'clusters') involving 536,233 women. Different clusters of centres introduced the tool over time until all centres were using the tool. Both studies were carried out in low‐resource healthcare settings. The tools were called the 'Saving Mothers Score' (SMS) and the CRADLE Vital Sign Alert (VSA) device. Risk of bias in the two studies was low or unclear.\\xa0 \\nWe found that the tools probably do not reduce maternal death. Women may have less serious bleeding (or haemorrhage) when an early warning tool is used. This finding was supported by low‐certainty evidence.\\xa0We also found that the tools may make little or no difference to a potentially life‐threatening body response to infection (sepsis), to blood pressure with swelling, protein in the urine and convulsions (eclampsia), to a serious illness in pregnancy that affects the blood and the way the liver works (HELLP), or being admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU). Use of the tools probably reduces the time a woman stays in hospital (moderate‐certainty evidence). We also found that the tools may make little or no difference to the death of the baby in the first month after birth (neonatal death). This finding was supported by low‐certainty evidence. Neither of the two included studies reported cost outcomes. \\nWhat does this mean? \\nUse of early warning tools for women in maternity care in low‐resource settings\\xa0may reduce serious bleeding and probably reduces the number of days a woman stays in the hospital but may not reduce maternal or infant deaths. More studies are required on the different early warning systems in low‐resource settings. Studies are also needed in middle‐ and high‐resource settings, and in high‐ and low‐risk pregnant women. \\n\", '10.1002-14651858.CD013697.pub2-pls.txt': \"Treating long‐lasting blepharitis (swollen and itchy eyelids): how well do antibiotics (medicines that kill bacteria) work when taken by mouth (orally)? \\nKey messages· We did not find enough evidence to show how well antibiotics taken by mouth can treat long‐lasting blepharitis. \\n· One antibiotic tested may improve some clinical aspects (symptoms and course of the disease), but we are uncertain about its benefit in this respect, and it may also cause a higher number of unwanted effects. \\n· More studies are needed to find out how well antibiotics taken by mouth can treat long‐lasting blepharitis. \\nWhat is blepharitis?Blepharitis is a common condition affecting the eyes. It causes swelling and redness on the edges of the eyelids, making them feel sore, and an itching or a gritty feeling in the eyes. The most common causes of blepharitis are infection by a type of bacteria that lives on the surface of the eye, or skin conditions such as dermatitis. \\nHow is blepharitis treated?Blepharitis is usually treated by regularly cleaning the eyelids, or using a cream or eye drops containing an antibiotic (a type of medicine that kills bacteria). If these do not work, then taking antibiotics by mouth (orally) is often tried. However, there are no guidelines about which type of antibiotic to give, what dose to use, or how long treatment should last. \\nWhat did we want to find out?We wanted to find out how well antibiotics given by mouth can treat long‐lasting blepharitis. \\nWhat did we do?We searched for studies that tested antibiotics given by mouth to treat long‐lasting blepharitis. \\nWhat did we find?We found 2 studies in 220 adults with long‐lasting blepharitis. One study took place in the USA and lasted for three months; it tested the antibiotic doxycycline compared to placebo treatment (a 'dummy' treatment that does not contain any medicine but looks identical to the medicine being tested). The other study took place in South Korea and tested the effects of high or low doses of doxycycline compared to placebo treatment. \\nOne study was funded by a pharmaceutical company; the other study did not report a source of funding. The studies measured results of treatment in different ways, so it was not possible to combine the studies' results to analyse them together. \\nWhat are the main results of our review?We are uncertain about the effects of doxycycline on symptoms such as itching, burning, and watery eyes, as evaluated by people taking part in the studies. \\nOne study measured changes in how much an affected eye watered (produced tears) before and after one month of treatment. High‐ and low‐dose doxycycline may improve the eye's ability to produce tears (evidence from 1 study with 93 people in each dose group). \\nOne study evaluated dryness of the eye by measuring the time it took for a dry spot to appear on the surface of the eye after blinking (the 'tear film break‐up time'). Taking doxycycline (high‐ and low‐dose) for one month may improve problems with dryness (evidence from 1 study with 93 people in each dose group). \\nTaking doxycycline for one month may cause more unwanted effects than taking a placebo (evidence from 1 study in 139 people). The number of unwanted effects reported was higher in the high‐dose doxycycline group. \\nNo studies measured:\\n· how many bacteria were present in the eye before or after treatment;\\n· people's well‐being (quality of life); or\\n· the costs and benefits of the treatments tested.\\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?We have very low confidence in the evidence because of limitations in the ways the studies were conducted, and because the results of the studies varied widely and were inconsistent. One study was funded by a pharmaceutical company, which could have affected the way the study was designed, conducted, and reported. Further research is likely to change and increase our confidence in the results. \\nHow up‐to‐date is the evidence?The evidence is current up to 29 August 2020. \\n\", '10.1002-14651858.CD013465.pub2-pls.txt': 'Individualized versus standard diet fortification for growth and development in very low birth weight infants receiving human milk \\nReview question: does individualized rather than standard, non‐individualized addition of nutrients and calories to breast milk feeds safely improve growth and other outcomes in preterm infants? \\nBackground: preterm infants are at risk for poor growth following birth. Breast milk reduces their risk of illness but does not meet their nutritional needs. Therefore, breast milk fed to preterm infants must be fortified with extra nutrients. Usual methods of fortifying breast milk treat all breast milk and all preterm infants the same. However, two methods are available for individualizing fortification for each preterm infant. Targeted fortification adds nutrients to breast milk based on the results of breast milk analysis. Adjustable fortification adds nutrients based on the results of preterm infant laboratory results. Individualized fortification may improve preterm infant growth or other outcomes. However, it is not known whether targeted or adjustable fortification is safe or improves outcomes for preterm infants compared with the standard method. \\nStudy characteristics: through literature searches updated to September 2019, we found seven studies that tested the effects of targeted or adjustable fortification of breast milk feeds compared to standard fortification in preterm infants, yielding eight publications (521 total participants were enrolled in these studies). One study that was published after our literature search was completed is awaiting classification. \\nKey results: targeted or adjustable fortification improves short‐term growth compared to standard fortification in preterm infants. Determining the best way to customize breast milk feeds is necessary, as is clarifying its safety and effects on other clinical outcomes. \\nCertainty of evidence: very low to moderate. Moderate certainty means that the true effect of individualized fortification on growth in preterm infants is likely to be close to the result of this review but there is a possibility that it is substantially different. Low certainty means that the true effect may be substantially different from the results of this review. Very low certainty means that the true effect of individualized fortification on growth in preterm infants is likely to be substantially different from the results of this review. Certainty of evidence was downgraded most often in this review due to small numbers of participants in included studies and significant differences in study design and outcome measures among included studies. \\n', '10.1002-14651858.CD013512.pub2-pls.txt': 'What surgical procedure works best to slow the progression of keratoconus (an eye disease)? \\nWhy is this question important?Keratoconus is a disease that affects the thin, clear outer layer of the eye, known as the cornea. Normally, the cornea is dome‐shaped. In people with keratoconus, the cornea slowly thins, and a cone‐shaped bulge develops in the center of the cornea. The disease usually begins between the ages of teens and 40, and persists throughout life. It causes blurry or distorted vision that may not be improved by wearing glasses and may result in perforation of the cornea and other visual problems. \\nTreatments such as glasses and contact lenses can be used to improve the vision of people with keratoconus. However, these do not slow the progression of the disease. The only treatment known to slow disease progression is ‘corneal collagen crosslinking’ (CXL). \\nCXL is a surgical procedure that aims to strengthen the cornea and prevent further thinning. It involves shining ultraviolet A (invisible) light rays onto eyes that have been treated with eye drops containing riboflavin (a vitamin). When the light rays meet the riboflavin, new links form between the fibers that make up the cornea. \\nThere are two types of CXL. One type requires the removal of the cells on surface of the cornea, to make it easier for the riboflavin to reach the cornea. This procedure is called ‘epithelium‐off CXL’. The other type does not require the removal of these cells. This procedure is called ‘transepithelial CXL’. Surgeons who carry out this procedure can use chemicals to help riboflavin penetrate the cells on the surface of the cornea. They can also deliver riboflavin to the cornea using a small electrical current (iontophoresis). \\nEpithelium‐off CXL is the more commonly used procedure. However, transepithelial CXL could have advantages, such as faster healing and less patient discomfort. We reviewed the evidence to find out which of these two procedures is more beneficial and less risky for people with keratoconus. \\nHow did we identify and evaluate the evidence?We searched the medical literature for studies that compared epithelium‐off CXL against transepithelial CXL. Then we compared the results and summarized the evidence from all the studies. We rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes, and the consistency of findings across studies. \\nWhat did we find?We found 13 studies with a total of 567 people. The studies took place in Europe, the Middle East, India, Russia, and Turkey. The shortest studies lasted six months, and the longest study lasted more than three years. Eleven studies compared transepithelial CXL without iontophoresis against epithelium‐off CXL. Three studies compared transepithelial CXL with iontophoresis against epithelium‐off CXL. \\nTransepithelial CXL without iontophoresis compared to epithelium‐off CXL \\nWe do not know if one procedure is better than the other for preventing progression of keratoconus or visual loss because too few robust studies have compared the effects of these two CXL methods. \\nEvidence from four studies suggests that corneal hazing (clouding of the cornea) or scarring are probably more common with epithelium‐off CXL. \\nTransepithelial CXL with iontophoresis compared to epithelium‐off CXL \\nEvidence from two studies suggests that there may be little to no difference between the two procedures in changes to vision clarity. We do not know if one procedure is better than the other to prevent progression of keratoconus because two few robust studies have compared the two methods. \\nThe evidence does not suggest that one procedure leads to more unwanted events than the other. However, our confidence in this evidence is low, because it is based on three studies that did not use robust methods. \\nWhat does this mean?Due to a lack of robust evidence, we do not know if epithelium‐off CXL or transepithelial CXL is better for slowing keratoconus progression. \\nAdverse events such as corneal hazing or scarring are probably more common with epithelium‐off CXL than with transepithelial CXL without iontophoresis. \\nWe need more and larger studies to strengthen the evidence. These should compare the benefits and the risks of different CXL procedures. Studies should aim to follow patients for more than 12 months, so that long‐term effects can be compared as it can take at least that much time for corneal tissue to heal from any procedure. \\nHow‐up‐to date is this review?The evidence in this Cochrane Review is current to January 2020. \\n', '10.1002-14651858.CD013263.pub2-pls.txt': 'What are the benefits and risks of a single injection of ketorolac (an anti‐inflammation medicine) for relieving short‐term pain after surgery in adults? \\nKey messages \\n· Ketorolac may reduce short‐term pain after surgery by 50% (half) or more in more people than a placebo (dummy treatment).· There may be little to no difference between ketorolac and other anti‐inflammation medicines in the number of people whose pain is reduced by half or more.· Ketorolac probably causes slightly more unwanted effects than placebo and other anti‐inflammation medicines; more evidence is required to establish if it causes serious unwanted effects. \\nTreating short‐term pain after surgery \\nIt is common for people to feel pain in the short term (within six hours) after surgery. Often, medicines called non‐steroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are given to relieve this pain. \\nNSAIDS work by stopping the body’s production of chemicals that cause inflammation and pain. A potential\\xa0advantage of using NSAIDs is that they may limit the need for stronger pain‐relief medicine such as opioids. Opioids can cause unwanted (adverse) events such as nausea and vomiting, constipation, breathing problems and allergic reactions. People may become addicted to opioids if they take a lot of them. \\nNSAIDs can also cause unwanted effects. These include bleeding at the site of the surgical wound, and potential injury to the kidneys and gut. It is therefore important to weigh the benefits and risks of NSAIDs when considering using them to reduce pain shortly after surgery. \\nWhat did we want to find out? \\nWe wanted to find out about the benefits and risks of using a specific NSAID, ketorolac, for relief of short‐term pain after surgery. Ketorolac can be given as an injection, which may be useful when patients cannot take medicines by mouth. \\nWhat did we do? \\nWe searched for studies that involved adults (aged over 18) and compared a single injection of ketorolac against: \\n· a placebo (dummy treatment); or· another treatment. \\nWe compared and summarized the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes. \\nWhat did we find? \\nWe found 12 studies that involved 1905 people in total. The studies investigated the treatment of pain after surgery on the abdomen, pelvis, teeth, bones, joints and muscles. Most studies (10) treated people with a dose of 30 milligrams of ketorolac. They compared ketorolac against: \\n· a placebo;· another NSAID; or· an opioid. \\nHere we present the findings from comparisons between ketorolac and placebo or other NSAIDs. \\nPain reduction \\nThe evidence suggests that:\\n· around three times more people may have their pain reduced by 50% (half) or more within six hours of surgery when treated with ketorolac rather than placebo; and· there could be little to no difference between ketorolac and other NSAIDS in the number of people with pain reduced by 50% or more within four or six hours of surgery. \\nNeed for extra pain medicines (rescue medication) \\nKetorolac could delay the need for rescue medication compared to placebo or other NSAIDs. The evidence is not robust enough to show if fewer people need rescue medicine when treated with ketorolac. \\nAdverse effects \\nKetorolac probably causes slightly more adverse effects than placebo and other NSAIDS. Serious adverse effects (such as blood collecting in the muscles around the abdomen, causing severe pain) were rare in the studies we found; the evidence suggested there may be little to no difference in the number of serious adverse events between ketorolac and placebo or other NSAIDS. \\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence? \\nStudies were small, and most may have been conducted in ways that could introduce errors into their results. This limited our confidence in the evidence. \\nHow up to date is this evidence? \\nThe evidence is up to date to April 2020.\\n', '10.1002-14651858.CD009379.pub3-abstract.txt': 'Amniotic membrane transplantation for the treatment of ocular burns\\nHow an ocular burn damages the eye \\nThe cornea is the transparent window of the eye that helps focus light to form an image of the outside world. For the cornea to remain transparent, it must have a healthy surface layer of epithelium, a stable tear film, and an absence of blood vessels. The epithelium is the moist cellular layer that covers the cornea, the white part of the eye, and the inside of the eyelids. The epithelium that covers the cornea is different from the epithelium of the conjunctiva. It is maintained in this state by a population of specialised stem cells found at the margin of the cornea (the limbus). In the normal eye, corneal epithelial cells slowly migrate from the limbus towards the centre of the cornea. \\nA burn to the eye initially damages the surface epithelial layer, but it can also damage the deeper structures of the eye and the eyelids. A characteristic of an acute burn is an epithelial defect. This defect can fully recover after a minor burn. However, if the burn damages the stem cells of a segment of the limbus, the normal epithelium central to that area may not recover. The cornea is then covered by a functionally different type of epithelium derived from the peripheral conjunctiva, which may take weeks or months, and the cornea can become hazy and vascularised. In the absence of any epithelial covering, an additional risk is that the deeper tissues of the exposed cornea (stroma) may become progressively thinner and eventually perforate. The more extensive the damage to the limbus (measured in clock hours), the worse the outcome. The abnormal surface of the cornea, as well as haze and damage to structures within the eye (iris, lens, retina, optic nerve), can all lead to loss of vision. \\nTreatments for ocular burns \\nA burn to the surface of the eye is an emergency, and the eye must be washed immediately with water or saline to remove any chemical agents. The amount of damage to the epithelium (an epithelial defect) and the blood vessels at the edge of the cornea are measured, estimating the risk of future complications. The eye is then treated with medicines to reduce the risk of further complications and help the epithelial layer recover. Some doctors also use an amniotic tissue membrane placed over the surface of the eye. The amniotic membrane is the sac that surrounds a baby as it develops inside its mother. \\nWhy we did this Cochrane Review \\nWe wanted to know whether using an amniotic membrane with medicines is better than just medicines. \\nWhat did we do? \\nWe looked for studies in which an amniotic membrane was used to treat eyes that had been burned. We then looked for studies comparing eyes treated with medicines and an amniotic membrane patch with eyes treated using only medicines. We looked for randomised controlled trials, in which the treatment that people received was decided at random because these studies give the most reliable evidence about the effect of treatment. We assessed the treatment of moderate burns and severe burns separately, because they have different outcomes. We measured whether the treatment worked by comparing the proportion of eyes in which the epithelium over the cornea had failed to recover 21 days after the injury, visual function at the end of treatment, the presence of abnormal new blood vessels on the cornea, scarring between the cornea and the lids, the time taken for the epithelium to heal and adverse events in the intervention and control groups. We assessed the risk of bias in the randomised controlled study findings across pre‐specified domains. We used the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) criteria to evaluate certainty of evidence include risk of bias, imprecision, inconsistency, indirectness, and publication bias.\\xa0 \\nWhat we found \\nWe found two randomised controlled studies comparing the effect of medicines with the addition of an amniotic membrane patch inserted within seven days of the injury against medicines alone. One study suggested that treatment with amnion may be beneficial in moderate burns, but we found the certainty of the evidence to be low due to a high risk of bias and serious imprecision. For severe burns, there were no important differences between eyes that received an amniotic membrane and eyes that did not.\\xa0 \\nConclusions \\nThere is only uncertain evidence from randomised controlled studies of an important difference in healing between eyes treated with medicines and an amniotic membrane within seven days of an ocular burn and eyes that are treated only with medicines. Further research is needed to identify the best treatment for acute burns to the eye to reduce the risk of potentially devastating consequences and visual loss. \\nHow up to date is this review?Searches were last done in September 2021. \\n', '10.1002-14651858.CD013779-pls.txt': \"What is the best way to support resilience and mental well‐being in frontline healthcare professionals during and after a pandemic? \\nWhat is ‘resilience’? \\nWorking as a 'frontline' health or social care professional during a global disease pandemic, like COVID‐19, can be very stressful. Over time, the negative effects of stress can lead to mental health problems such as depression and anxiety, which, in turn, may affect work, family and other social relationships. ‘Resilience’ is the ability to cope with the negative effects of stress and so avoid mental health problems and their wider effects. \\nHealthcare providers can use various strategies (interventions) to support resilience and mental well‐being in their frontline healthcare professionals. These could include work‐based interventions, such as changing routines or improving equipment; or psychological support interventions, such as counselling. \\nWhat did we want to find out? \\nFirst (objective 1), we wanted to know how successfully any interventions improved frontline health professionals’ resilience or mental well‐being. \\nSecond (objective 2), we wanted to know what made it easier (facilitators) or harder (barriers) to deliver these interventions. \\nWhat did we do? \\nWe searched medical databases for any kind of study that investigated interventions designed to support resilience and mental well‐being in healthcare professionals working at the front line during infectious disease outbreaks. The disease outbreaks had to be classified by the World Health Organization (WHO) as epidemics or pandemics, and take place from 2002 onwards (the year before the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak). \\nWhat did we find? \\nWe found 16 relevant studies. These studies came from different disease outbreaks ‐ two were from SARS; nine from Ebola; one from Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS); and four from COVID‐19. The studies mainly looked at workplace interventions that involved either psychological support (for example, counselling or seeing a psychologist) or work‐based interventions (for example, giving training, or changing routines). \\nObjective 1: one study investigated how well an intervention worked. This study was carried out immediately after the Ebola outbreak, and investigated whether staff who were training to give other people (such as patients and their family members) 'psychological first aid' felt less ‘burnt out’. We had some concerns about the results that this study reported and about some of its methods. This means that our certainty of the evidence is very low and we cannot say whether the intervention helped or not. \\nObjective 2: all 16 studies provided some evidence about barriers and facilitators to implement interventions. We found 17 main findings from these studies. We do not have high confidence in any of the findings; we had moderate confidence in six findings and low to very low confidence in 11 findings. \\nWe are moderately confident that the following two factors were barriers to implementation of an intervention: frontline workers, or the organisations in which they worked, not being fully aware of what they needed to support their mental well‐being; and a lack of equipment, staff time or skills needed for an intervention. \\nWe are moderately confident that the following three factors were facilitators to implementation of an intervention: interventions that could be adapted for a local area; having effective communication, both formally within an organisation and informal or social networks; and having positive, safe and supportive learning environments for frontline healthcare professionals. \\nWe are moderately confident that the knowledge and beliefs that frontline healthcare professionals have about an intervention can either help or hinder implementation of the intervention. \\nKey messages \\nWe did not find any evidence that tells us about how well different strategies work at supporting the resilience and mental well‐being of frontline workers. We found some limited evidence about things that might help successful delivery of interventions.

Very low birth weight newborn infants (i.e. those neonates with a gestational age less than 32 weeks) have low level of antithrombin in the blood. On the basis of an observational study in very preterm infants, it has been suggested that the administration of drugs that prevent clotting (anticoagulants) such as antithrombin may reduce the risk of intraventricular hemorrhage and progression of intraventricular hemorrhage, a frequent complication of preterm neonates. This systematic review synthesizes the available evidence on the effectiveness of antithrombin in preventing intraventricular hemorrhage in very preterm neonates. \\nStudy characteristics: We included two trials for a total of 182 newborn infants comparing antithrombin with placebo (sugar or albumin solution). \\nResults: The use of antithrombin does not reduce the risks of bleeding in the brain, mortality or any other relevant outcomes in very preterm neonates when compared to placebo. However, the data collected are too limited to draw definitive conclusions on the use of antithrombin in the prevention of intraventricular hemorrhage (i.e. bleeding in the brain). \\nConclusions: The results of this systematic review are consistent with either a benefit or a detrimental effect of antithrombin and do not provide a definitive answer to the review question. \\n', '10.1002-14651858.CD004314.pub3-abstract.txt': \"A comparison of botulinum toxin type A versus botulinum toxin type B for involuntary positioning of the head, or cervical dystonia \\nThe review question \\nWe reviewed the evidence about the effect of botulinum toxin type A (BtA) compared to botulinum toxin type B (BtB) in people with involuntary positioning of the head, or cervical dystonia. This is an update of a previous Cochrane Review and we assessed the effectiveness (reduction in severity, disability and pain) and safety of BtA versus BtB in cervical dystonia. \\nBackground \\nCervical dystonia, also called spasmodic torticollis, is a disease that causes undesired, uncontrollable, often painful, abnormal placement of the head. It is a relatively uncommon condition (affecting 57 to 280 people per million) that can be very disabling and can affect a person's quality of life negatively. In most cases the cause is unknown and no cure exists. Since cervical dystonia is normally a long‐term disease it requires long‐term treatment. \\nBotulinum toxin (Bt) is a powerful, natural chemical that can cause severe paralysis (an inability to move in the part of the body where it is applied) in animals and humans. It can also be used to treat many conditions, in particular those with involuntary muscle contractions, such as cervical dystonia. Bt is delivered by injections into the muscles that contract to produce the disease. There are different types of Bt, not all are available for treating health conditions. BtA is typically the first‐used treatment in cervical dystonia, but botulinum toxin type B (BtB) is an alternative option. The relative strength of each Bt formulation is variable, and the cost for 200 units varies from GBP 198 to GBP 308. \\nStudy characteristics \\nWe performed a rigorous search of the medical literature in October 2016 and found three studies that compared a single treatment session of BtA with BtB. These studies included a total of 270 participants, with on average a moderate disease impairment. The participants remained in the studies for a short period of time ‐ between 16 and 20 weeks after the treatment. The average age of people in the studies was 53.3 years, and they had had cervical dystonia for an average of 6.6 to 7.9 years before taking part in the trials. Most, 63.3%, of the people in the studies were women. All three of the studies were funded by drug manufacturers with possible interests in the results of the studies. \\nKey results \\nThe results show little or no difference between BtA and BtB in the main measures of overall improvement and safety, including the total number of adverse (unwanted or harmful) events. There was also little or no difference between BtA and BtB in the self‐evaluations reported by the study participants. Based on the results we would expect that, out of 1000 people with cervical dystonia treated with BtB, there would be 362 more people who experience dry mouth/sore throat compared to 1000 people treated with BtA. The studies which looked at the duration of effect showed little or no difference between BtA and BtB. None of the studies examined the impact of either Bt on quality of life. \\nQuality of the evidence \\nAll of the studies included participants that were different to the average person who suffers from cervical dystonia. To be included participants had to have a history of successful treatment with Bt. People with certain types of cervical dystonia, in particular the forms that make the head turn backward or forward, were not allowed to participate in the studies. \\nNot enough participants were included across the studies for us to be completely confident in the results for the total number of adverse events, the self‐reported evaluations by participants or the pain assessment. \\nThe quality of the evidence for overall improvement and total number of adverse events was low. The quality of the evidence for more sore throat/dry mouth in people receiving BtB is moderate. The quality of the evidence where participants gave their self‐assessments is low. \\nNo definite conclusions can be drawn regarding overall safety and long‐term utility of BtA compared to BtB in cervical dystonia. \\n\", '10.1002-14651858.CD013515.pub2-pls.txt': \"What are the benefits and risks of psychological therapies for adults and young people over 12 years old with painful temporomandibular disorders (TMDs)? \\nKey messages \\nThe overall results are mixed, but indicate that psychological therapies may be a useful approach for painful TMD as there is some limited evidence that they can reduce the pain. Our review suggests that they may do this at least as well as other available treatments. Any negative effects of psychological therapies are unclear, and more research is needed before we can know whether they provide a noticeable benefit while causing no or few problems. \\nWhat is the condition? \\nTemporomandibular disorders (TMDs) are conditions that affect the jaw joint and the muscles that move it.

Most of the reports we found compared psychological therapy to medication or the use of a special mouthguard.\\xa0 \\nWe chose to focus on three measures of success. These were reduction in pain intensity, interference with activities caused by pain ('pain disability'), and psychological distress. We looked for details of these measures immediately after treatment and a few months later. We also looked for information on any 'adverse effects' (negative side effects of the treatments).\\xa0 \\nWe used standard Cochrane methods to decide which studies to include, collect the key information from the studies, judge whether or not the studies were biased in any way, and judge how certain we can be about the results. \\nWhat did we find? \\nOverall we found 22 relevant studies. Most of the studies reported on one particular form of psychological therapy called cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT). We did not have enough information to draw any conclusions about any other psychological therapies. \\nThe results told us that CBT was no different to other treatments (e.g. oral splints, medicine) or usual care/no treatment in reducing the intensity of the TMD pain by the end of treatment. There was some evidence that people who had CBT might have slightly less pain a few months after treatment.\\xa0 \\nThere was some evidence that CBT might be better than other treatments for reducing psychological distress both at the end of treatment and a few months later. This was not seen in the one study that compared CBT against usual care. \\nIn terms of how much pain interfered with activities, there was no evidence that there was any difference between CBT and other treatments.\\xa0 \\nThere was too little information to be sure about whether psychological treatments cause adverse effects (problems caused by treatment such as feeling unwell or worse pain or unexpected effects). Only six of the 22 studies measured what adverse effects participants experienced. In these six studies, adverse effects associated with psychological treatment seemed to be minor in general and to occur less often than in alternative treatment groups.\\xa0 \\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence? \\nWe have little confidence in the evidence because many of the studies had design limitations. There was also variation in the length of treatment and in how it was delivered. This means that we need to be cautious in interpreting the results that we found and they may not be reliable. \\nHow up to date is the evidence? \\nWe searched for studies up to 21 October 2021.\\n\", '10.1002-14651858.CD013231.pub2-pls.txt': \"The use of respiratory support\\xa0without endotracheal tube\\xa0(i.e. non‐invasive) in babies to manage rapid breathing (transient tachypnea of the newborn) \\nReview question \\nDoes the use of\\xa0respiratory support\\xa0without endotracheal tube\\xa0(i.e. non‐invasive) in babies with rapid breathing (transient tachypnea of the newborn) improve lung function and reduce the need for invasive respiratory support with an endotracheal tube? \\nBackground \\nTransient tachypnea (abnormally rapid breathing) of the newborn is characterized by high respiratory rate (more than 60 breaths per minute) and signs of respiratory distress (difficulty in breathing). It typically appears within the first two hours of life in infants born at or after 34 weeks' gestational age.\\xa0Although transient tachypnea of the newborn usually improves without treatment, it might be associated with wheezing in late childhood.\\xa0The idea behind using non‐invasive respiratory support for transient tachypnea of the newborn consists of\\xa0reducing\\xa0fluid from small cavities within the lungs called the alveoli and providing support to the baby with breathing difficulties.

However, NSAIDs can have side effects. NSAIDS (such as ibuprofen) may result in bleeding (e.g. at the site of an incision or wound) and may result in injury to the kidneys and gut.\\xa0 \\nPatients need more and better treatment options to help manage short‐term pain after surgery. There is a lot of concern about using opioids to treat short‐term pain because of the risk that patients can develop unpleasant side effects or opioid over‐use disorder. It is therefore important to weigh the benefits and risks of NSAIDs when considering using them to reduce pain shortly after surgery. \\nWhat did we want to find out? \\nIbuprofen is a NSAID that can be delivered intravenously. We wanted to know if intravenous ibuprofen (delivered by injection or drip) is a helpful treatment option to manage moderate‐to‐severe pain when patients cannot take medicines by mouth.\\xa0 \\nWhat did we do? \\nTo make the comparison fair, patients in the studies must all have had the same random chance (like the flip of a coin) to receive the ibuprofen or the other treatment.\\xa0 \\nWe searched the medical literature (clinical studies) up to June 2021, where intravenous ibuprofen was used to treat pain after surgery in adults (aged over 18) and compared against: \\n‐ a placebo (a control treatment, such as a bag of saline administered into a vein); or \\n‐ another medicine.\\nWhat did we find? \\nWe found only one study which was suitable to include in our review.\\xa0The study looked at the management of pain after bunionectomy. Bunionectomy is a surgery to remove a bunion at the base of the big toe. This study evaluated 201 people, mostly females.

Of interest were live birth rate, gastrointestinal side effects and additional reproductive outcomes. \\nBackground \\nWomen with PCOS often have infrequent or no periods because they do not ovulate (release an egg), which can result in infertility. They may also develop problems such as obesity and diabetes. High levels of insulin, a hormone that allows the body to use sugar for energy, may be a cause of PCOS and levels are generally higher in obese women. Metformin helps the body use insulin more effectively and improves ovulation in women with PCOS. However, metformin may cause side effects such as nausea, diarrhoea or constipation (gastrointestinal side effects). \\nStudy characteristics \\nWe searched for studies in women with PCOS that compared metformin alone or with CC, letrozole or LOD, against CC, letrozole, LOD, placebo (sham treatment) or no treatment. This review updates the previous version of the review. We included 41 randomised controlled trials (where women were randomly allocated to a treatment) with 4552 women. 13 studies are new for this update. We combined results from the studies and assessed the quality of the studies to judge how confident we could be in their results. The evidence is current up to December 2018. \\nKey results \\nMetformin versus placebo/no treatment \\nMetformin may increase the chances of having a live birth compared with no treatment or placebo, however women taking metformin probably experience more gastrointestinal side effects. With placebo, the live birth rate is 19%, and it would be between 19% and 37% with metformin. The risk of gastrointestinal side effects is 10% with placebo, but higher with metformin, between 22% and 40%. Women taking metformin are probably more likely to get pregnant and may be more likely to ovulate. We are uncertain about the effect of metformin compared to placebo or no treatment on miscarriage. \\nMetformin plus CC versus CC alone \\nWe are uncertain if metformin plus CC improves live birth rate compared to CC alone, but gastrointestinal side effects are probably more common. The live birth rate with CC alone is 24% which may change to between 23% to 34% with metformin and CC combined. With CC alone, the risk of gastrointestinal side effects is 9%, which increases to between 21% to 37% with metformin and CC combined. However, pregnancy rate is probably improved with metformin and CC. Ovulation rates may be improved with metformin and CC. There was no clear evidence of an effect on miscarriage. \\nMetformin versus CC \\nWe combined all the studies and found that the quality of evidence was very low, results were inconsistent, and we could not confidently draw conclusions. Obese women had a lower birth rate with metformin, while non‐obese women showed a possible benefit from metformin. The live birth rate of non‐obese women with CC is 26%, which may increase to between 26% and 50% with metformin. However, in obese women, the live birth rate is 22% which may decrease to between 5% to 13% with metformin. Similarly, among obese women taking metformin there may be lower rates of clinical pregnancy and ovulation while, non‐obese women taking metformin may have more pregnancies; there was no clear difference in ovulation rates. We are uncertain whether there is a difference in miscarriage rates between women taking metformin or CC. No studies reported gastrointestinal side effects. It is possible that a woman's body mass index (a measure of healthy weight based on height and weight) affects which treatment she should take, although further research is required to establish this. The limited improvement in outcomes such as diabetes with metformin highlights the importance of weight loss and lifestyle adjustment, particularly in overweight women with PCOS. \\nQuality of the evidence \\nThe quality of the evidence ranged from very low to moderate. The main problems were that the studies’ methods were poor or unclear, or they did not report all their results (risk of bias), or they were inaccurate and inconsistent. \\n\", '10.1002-14651858.CD013228-pls.txt': 'Short‐acting insulin analogues versus regular human insulin for type 2 diabetes mellitus\\nReview question \\nAre short‐acting insulin analogues better than regular human insulin for adult, non‐pregnant people with type 2 diabetes? \\nBackground \\nShort‐acting insulin analogues act more quickly than regular human insulin. They can be injected immediately before meals and lead to lower blood sugar levels after food intake. Whether people with diabetes really profit from these newer insulins is debated. \\nStudy characteristics \\nWe found 10 randomised controlled trials (clinical studies where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups) comparing the short‐acting insulin analogues insulin lispro, insulin aspart, or insulin glulisine to regular human insulin in 2751 participants. The people in the included trials were monitored (followed) for 24 to 104 weeks. \\nThis evidence is up to date as of 31 October 2018.\\nKey results \\nWe are uncertain whether short‐acting insulin analogues are better than regular human insulin for long‐term blood glucose control or for reducing the number of times blood sugar levels drop below normal (hypoglycaemic episodes). The studies were too short to reliably investigate death from any cause. We found no clear effect of insulin analogues on health‐related quality of life. We found no information on late diabetes complications, such as problems with the eyes, kidneys, or feet. No study reported on socioeconomic effects, such as costs of the intervention and absence from work. \\nCertainty of the evidence \\nThe overall certainty of the included studies was low or very low for most outcomes, mainly because all studies were carried out in an open‐labelled fashion (study participants and study personnel knew who was getting which treatment).

People with this condition often feel depressed, tired, and stiff, and have difficulty sleeping. Mixed exercise is defined as regular sessions of two or more types of exercise including aerobic (walking or cycling), strengthening (lifting weights or pulling against resistance bands), or flexibility (stretching) exercise. \\nStudy characteristics \\nReviewers searched for studies until December 2017, and found 29 studies (2088 people) conducted in 12 different countries. The average age of study participants was 51 years, and 98% were female. The average exercise programme was 14 weeks long with three sessions of 50 to 60 minutes per week. All exercise programmes were fully or partially supervised. Reviewers were most interested in comparing mixed exercise groups to control groups (19 studies; 1065 people). People in control groups either received no treatment or continued their usual care. \\nKey results – mixed exercise vs control \\nEach outcome below is measured on a scale that goes from 0 to 100, where lower scores are better. \\nHealth‐related quality of life (HRQL)  \\nAfter 5 to 26 weeks, people who exercised were 7% better (3% better to 11% better) or improved by 7 points on a 100 point scale. \\nPeople who exercised rated their HRQL at 49 points.\\nPeople in the control group rated their HRQL at 56 points.\\nPain  \\nAfter 5 to 26 weeks, people who exercised had 5% less pain (1% better to 9% better) or improved by 5 points on a 100 point scale. \\nPeople who exercised rated their pain at 53 points.\\nPeople in the control group rated their pain at 58.6 points.\\nTiredness  \\nAfter 14 to 24 weeks, people who exercised were 13% less tired (8% better to 18% better) or improved by 13 points on a 100 point scale \\nPeople who exercised rated their tiredness at 59 points.\\nPeople in the control group rated their tiredness at 72 points.\\nStiffness  \\nAfter 16 weeks, people who exercised were 7% less stiff (1% better 1 to 12% better) or improved by 7 points on a 100 point scale. \\nPeople who exercised rated their stiffness at 61 points.\\nPeople in the control group rated their stiffness at 68 points.\\nAbility to do daily activities (physical function)  \\nAfter 8 to 24 weeks, people who exercised were 11% better (7% to 15%) or improved by 11 points on a 100 point scale. \\nPeople who exercised rated their physical function at 38 points.\\nPeople in the control group rated their physical function at 49 points.\\nHarms ‐ Some participants experienced increased pain, soreness, or tiredness during or after exercise. Studies reported no injuries or other harms. However, reporting of harms was missing or incomplete in many studies. We are uncertain whether risk is increased with exercise. \\nLeaving the study early – 11% of control participants left the study early compared with 12% of exercisers. \\nLong‐term effects ‐ Analysis of long‐term effects of HRQL showed maintenance of mixed exercise effects at 6 to 12 weeks and at 13 to 26 weeks but not at 27 to 52 weeks. Very low‐quality evidence suggests that it is uncertain whether mixed exercises improve HRQL in the long term. Withdrawals and adverse events were not measured. \\nOther ‐ Reviewers found no evidence that the benefits and harms of mixed exercise were any different from education programmes, cognitive‐behavioural training, biofeedback, medication, or other types of exercise. \\nConclusions and quality of evidence \\nMixed exercise may improve HRQL and the ability to do daily activities, may decrease pain and tiredness, and may be acceptable to individuals with fibromyalgia. Low‐quality evidence suggests that mixed exercise may slightly improve stiffness. When compared to other exercise or non‐exercise interventions, we are uncertain about the effects of mixed exercise. Although mixed exercise appears to be well tolerated (similar numbers of people leaving the study across groups), evidence on harms was scarce, so we are uncertain about its safety. Reviewers considered the quality of evidence to be low to moderate because of small numbers of people in the studies, some issues involving study design, and the low quality of results. \\n', '10.1002-14651858.CD012216.pub2-abstract.txt': \"18F‐florbetapir PET scan for the early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease dementia and other dementias in people with mild cognitive impairment \\nReview question: In people with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), does using a 18F PET scan with florbetapir predict the progression to Alzheimer's disease dementia (ADD) and other dementias? \\nBackground \\nDue to global ageing, the number of people with dementia is expected to increase dramatically in the next few decades. Diagnosing dementia at an early stage is desirable, but there is no widespread agreement on the best approach. A range of simple pen and paper tests used by healthcare professionals can assess people with poor memory or cognitive impairment. Whether or not using special PET scans that detect amyloid —one of the hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease— improves our ability to predict the progression from MCI to ADD or other forms of dementia remains unclear. Since these tests are expensive, it is important that they provide additional benefits. \\nAim \\nWe aimed to evaluate the accuracy of the 18F‐florbetapir PET scan in identifying those people with MCI who clinically progress to ADD, other types of dementia, or any form of dementia over a period of time. \\nStudy characteristics \\nThe evidence is current to May 2017. We found three studies including 453 participants with MCI. Two studies evaluated the progression from MCI to ADD and one study evaluated the progression from MCI to any form of dementia. \\nRegarding the two studies that evaluated the progression from MCI to ADD, one study had 401 participants with a follow‐up of 1.6 years and the mean age was 72 years. The other study had 47 participants with a follow‐up of three years, and the mean age was 72 years. \\nThe other study that looked at any form of dementia included 5 participants over 90 years old. \\nTwo of the studies were funded by the test manufacturer.\\nQuality of the evidence \\nThe main limitation of this review was that our findings were based on only three studies, with insufficient detail on how the people were selected, whether the information from the scan was assessed separately from the final diagnosis. The studies were considered to be at high risk of bias due to potential conflicts of interest detected. \\nKey findings \\nIn this review, we found the following results based on the three studies.\\nAt a follow‐up of 1.6 years, using visual assessment, the scan correctly classified 89% of the participants who progressed to ADD but only 58% of the participants who did not progress to ADD. This means that in a group of 100 people with MCI, 15% of whom will develop ADD, we would expect 13 of 15 people to have a positive result and the other 2 participants to be falsely negative. Also 49 people who will not develop ADD would have a negative result, but 36 people who will not develop ADD would have a positive result (false positives). \\nIn the study that followed up people for three years and used visual assessment, the scan correctly classified 67% of people who progressed to ADD and 71% who did not progress to ADD. This means that in a group of 100 people with MCI, 19 of whom will develop ADD, we would expect 13 people to have a positive result of the scan and 6 people to have a falsely negative result. In addition, 58 of 81 participants who will not progress to ADD would have a negative result, but 23 people who will not develop ADD would have a positive result (false positives). The small number of participants evaluated at three years lowered our confidence on these estimates of accuracy. \\nRegarding progression to any form of dementia, the extremely small number of participants meant that we were unable to provide meaningful estimates of accuracy. \\nWe conclude that 18F‐florbetapir PET scans cannot be recommended for routine use in clinical practice to predict the progression from MCI to ADD or any form of dementia based on the currently available data.

If left untreated, about 50% to 60% of HIV‐infected infants will die by the age of two years. Children infected before birth are especially at high risk of death. HIV is incurable; however, there are medications that suppress HIV, known as antiretroviral drugs (ART). When HIV is detected early, severe illness and death from HIV‐related infections can be prevented by taking this medication.

Acute low back pain is defined as the presence of pain in the back, below the ribs and above the buttocks, for under 12 weeks. We compared NSAIDs to placebo, paracetamol, other NSAIDs, other drugs, and non‐drug treatments. \\nBackground \\nAcute low back pain is common, and causes pain and disability. Physicians often prescribe NSAIDs to treat acute low back pain. Different types of NSAIDs are available, both over‐the‐counter and as prescription drugs. \\nStudy characteristics \\nWe searched for randomised controlled trials that were published or registered before 7 January 2020. We included 32 trials with 5356 participants. Trial participants were 16 to 78 years old and had acute low back pain. Study length varied from one day to six months. The studies took place in many different countries. More than half of the studies was done in Europe and North‐America. \\nKey results \\nNSAIDs were slightly more effective than placebo for pain reduction in the first three weeks. On average, the pain intensity decreased by 7.3 points on a 100‐point scale. This means there was a small difference between the two treatments, but it was not clinically relevant. People receiving NSAIDs also scored 2.0 points better on a 24‐point disability scale than those receiving placebo. This is unlikely to be of real‐world benefit. There was a similar number of side effects between people receiving NSAIDs and people receiving placebo. However, the type of studies that we investigated are not designed to find side effects. Therefore, we should be careful about drawing conclusions based upon these findings. \\nWe also compared two different types of NSAIDs; non‐selective NSAIDs versus COX‐2 inhibitors. We found no clear differences in effect. There was also a similar number of reported side effects of the digestive system, such as abdominal pain, nausea, diarrhoea, or stomach symptoms. \\nQuality of the evidence \\nThere is moderate quality evidence that NSAIDs are slightly more effective than placebo for reducing short‐term pain, and high quality evidence that they are slightly more effective than placebo for reducing disability in acute low back pain.

These studies showed that trials with positive findings (defined either as those that were statistically significant (P < 0.05), or those findings perceived to be important or striking, or those indicating a positive direction of treatment effect), had nearly four times the odds of being published compared to findings that were not statistically significant (P ≥ 0.05), or perceived as unimportant, or showing a negative or null direction of treatment effect. This corresponds to a risk ratio of 1.78 (95% CI 1.58 to 1.95), assuming that 41% of negative trials are published.Two studies found that trials with positive findings also tended to be published more quickly than trials with negative findings.

NB‐UVB delivers almost exclusively 311 nm radiation, whereas BB‐UVB can be divided into two types: selective BB‐UVB (305 to 325 nm radiation) and conventional BB‐UVB (280 to 320 nm radiation). \\nThis review included 13 small randomised controlled trials (RCT), with a total of 662 participants. Most of these were of poor methodological quality. \\nFor treating CPP, the clearance rate between the NB‐UVB and oral PUVA groups were inconsistent in three RCTs. In one, there was no difference between the groups, and in the other two, the clearance rate was in favour of oral PUVA. The evidence from the comparison of NB‐UVB with bath PUVA in terms of clearance rate was also inconsistent: Pooled data from two left‐right body comparison RCTs found no significant difference between the two groups, while another RCT favoured bath PUVA. \\nTwo RCTs found NB‐UVB plus retinoid (re‐NB‐UVB) and PUVA plus retinoid (re‐PUVA) had similar effects for treating people with CPP or guttate psoriasis. One RCT found no significant differences between NB‐UVB and selective BB‐UVB for clearing CPP or in the number of withdrawals due to side‐effects. \\nIn participants with PPP, one RCT found there were no statistically significant differences between NB‐UVB treated sides and topical PUVA treated sides in terms of clearance rate. \\nIn summary, NB‐UVB may be preferred to oral or bath PUVA because it is more convenient to use. NB‐UVB seemed to be equal to selective BB‐UVB for clearing CPP. Evidence regarding NB‐UVB and conventional BB‐UVB is limited. The long‐term safety of NB‐UVB needs to be confirmed. The efficacy of NB‐UVB for clearing PPP needs to be confirmed in future studies. \\n\", '10.1002-14651858.CD013168.pub2-pls.txt': 'Internal iliac artery revascularisation versus internal iliac artery occlusion for endovascular treatment of aorto‐iliac aneurysms \\nBackground \\nAn aorto‐iliac aneurysm is a dilatation (aneurysm) of the aorta, the main large blood vessel in the body, which carries blood out from the heart to all organs and iliac arteries (distal branches of the aorta). The aneurysm can grow and burst (rupture), which leads to severe bleeding and is frequently fatal; an estimated 15,000 deaths occur each year from ruptured aortic abdominal aneurysms in the USA alone. To avoid this complication, the aorto‐iliac aneurysm should be repaired when the maximum diameter of the aorta reaches 5 cm to 5.5 cm, or when the maximum diameter of the common iliac arteries reaches 3 cm to 4 cm. \\nEndovascular repair of aorto‐iliac aneurysms is one approach that is used to manage this condition: a tube (stent‐graft) is placed inside the aorto‐iliac aneurysm, so that blood flows through the stent‐graft and no longer into the aneurysm, excluding it from the circulation. To achieve a successful deployment of the stent‐graft, a good seal zone (fixation zone) is needed in the aorta (proximal) and in the common iliac arteries (distal). However, in 40% of patients, the distal seal zone in the common iliac arteries is inadequate. In these cases, most commonly the stent‐graft is extended to the external iliac artery and the internal iliac artery is blocked (occluded). However, this obstruction (occlusion) is not without harms: the internal iliac artery supplies blood to the pelvic organs (rectum, bladder, and reproductive organs) and the pelvic muscles, and occlusion is associated with complications in the pelvic area such as buttock claudication (cramping pain in the buttock during exercise), sexual dysfunction, and spinal cord injury. \\nNew endovascular devices and techniques such as iliac branch devices have emerged to maintain blood flow into the internal iliac artery. These special stent‐grafts position the distal seal zone within the external iliac artery, and a side branch of the graft allows for revascularisation of the internal iliac artery, while excluding the aneurysm from the circulation, promoting an adequate distal seal zone, and maintaining pelvic circulation. This may also preserve the quality of life of treated individuals and may reduce serious complications including spinal cord ischaemia, ischaemic colitis, and gluteal necrosis. \\nThis review aimed to assess the effects of internal iliac artery revascularisation compared with internal iliac artery occlusion during endovascular repair of aorto‐iliac aneurysms. \\nStudy characteristics and key results \\nWe searched for evidence that directly compared internal iliac artery revascularisation versus internal iliac artery occlusion for endovascular treatment of aorto‐iliac aneurysms. Our searches up to 28 August 2019 did not identify any randomised controlled trials (clinical studies in which people are randomly (by chance alone) put into one of several intervention groups) that met our criteria. Studies are needed to help vascular and endovascular surgeons choose the best option for endovascular repair of aorto‐iliac aneurysms and isolated iliac aneurysms with an inadequate distal fixation zone. \\nConclusion \\nWe found no RCTs that compared internal iliac artery revascularisation versus internal iliac artery occlusion for endovascular treatment of aorto‐iliac aneurysms. High‐quality studies that evaluate the best strategy for managing the endovascular repair of aorto‐iliac aneurysms with inadequate distal seal zones in the common iliac artery are needed. \\n', '10.1002-14651858.CD013307.pub3-pls.txt': \"Non‐drug approaches for preventing delirium in adults receiving care in hospital outside of intensive care and high dependency units \\nReview question \\nWe reviewed the evidence for non‐pharmacological (non‐medication‐based) approaches to prevent delirium in adults in hospital, not including those treated in intensive care units (ICU, specialised wards for the care of critically ill patients). \\nBackground \\nDelirium is an important illness which is common among adults, especially older adults who are in hospital. It is sometimes referred to as an 'acute confusional state'. Typically, a person with delirium has sudden onset of confusion, which fluctuates, and often includes impaired concentration, memory and thinking skills; reduced awareness of surroundings; drowsiness or agitation and restlessness; and hallucinations, which are usually visual (seeing things which are not really there).\\xa0It can be distressing for the individual with delirium and their family. It is also associated with increased risks of complications, such as dying in hospital, having a longer hospital stay, and requiring more care after discharge. Increasingly, there is evidence that delirium is associated with an increased risk of permanent worsening of memory and thinking skills, including development or worsening of dementia.\\xa0 \\nNon‐pharmacological approaches are approaches which do not use medications, but which focus on other aspects of care. They are already recognised as important in reducing the risk of delirium, particularly multicomponent interventions which target several of the common risk factors for delirium. It is not known which components of these complex interventions are most important in preventing delirium and this was something we wanted to find out.\\xa0 \\nStudy characteristics \\nWe searched up to 16 September 2020 for reports of studies in which people in hospital were randomly allocated to a non‐pharmacological intervention intended to prevent delirium or to usual hospital care. \\xa0We found 22 studies with 5718\\xa0participants. Fourteen of the studies were of multicomponent approaches; two studies looked at different cut‐offs for giving a blood transfusion after an orthopaedic operation; the remaining six studies all considered different approaches. \\nKey findings \\nMulticomponent approaches probably reduce occurrence of delirium by 43% compared to usual hospital care. This means that two in five cases of delirium in adults in hospital wards (other than ICU) can be prevented by multicomponent, non‐pharmacological approaches. These interventions may also reduce the length of time people stay in hospital and, if delirium does occur, they may reduce the duration of the delirium episode by about a day. However, these approaches may have little or no effect on the risk of dying in hospital.\\xa0The studies did not investigate the effect of multicomponent interventions on the development or worsening of dementia. There was little information about whether the interventions had any harmful effects.\\xa0 \\nUsing a new statistical technique, we found \\xa0that the following components within each intervention were most important for preventing delirium: \\xa0(a) trying to keep people well‐oriented to their surroundings and making their surroundings more familiar, (b) providing stimulation to memory and thinking skills, and (c) trying to improve sleep (through sleep hygiene\\xa0measures). We could not be so certain about the effect of other components, largely because not enough evidence was available. More research is needed comparing the specific components included in multicomponent interventions to help determine the most effective and efficient ways to prevent delirium.\\xa0 \\nThe evidence for other, single‐component, non‐pharmacological interventions was very limited.\\xa0 \\nCertainty of the evidence \\nThere were some limitations in the studies which may affect the results. In many included studies\\xa0the people in the study and sometimes researchers were aware of who was and was not receiving the intervention.\\xa0 \\nThere was very little information about people living with dementia, who are at greater risk of experiencing delirium.\\xa0 \\nExternal funding \\nFunding to support researchers to undertake this review was received from the National Institute for Health Research (Incentive Award 130725) and Medical Research Scotland (Vacation Scholarship).\\xa0 \\n\", '10.1002-14651858.CD013240.pub2-pls.txt': 'Long‐term pituitary down‐regulation before in vitro fertilisation (IVF) for women with endometriosis \\nReview question \\nWe reviewed the efficacy and safety of treating women with known endometriosis (a disease characterised by the presence of endometrial tissue outside the cavity of the womb) with gonadotrophin‐releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist medication for a period of three to six months prior to in vitro fertilisation (IVF) and intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI). We aimed to compare this intervention to no treatment prior to IVF/ICSI, pretreatment with long‐term continuous combined oral contraception (COC) or surgical treatment to remove endometriomas (cysts forming in the ovaries as a consequence of endometriosis). \\nBackground \\nMany women affected by endometriosis suffer with infertility and may, as a result, seek IVF/ICSI treatment. IVF/ICSI is known to be less successful in women with endometriosis and a variety of interventions prior to IVF/ICSI have been proposed to try and improve outcomes. These include long‐term GnRH agonist therapy, long‐term continuous COC therapy or surgery to remove endometriomas. \\nStudy characteristics \\nWe found eight randomised controlled trials comparing long‐term GnRH agonist therapy with no pretreatment including a total of 640 women with endometriosis prior to IVF/ICSI. The evidence is current to January 2019. \\nKey results \\nCompared to no pretreatment, we are uncertain whether long‐term GnRH agonist therapy prior to IVF/ICSI in women with endometriosis affects the live birth rate. The evidence suggests that if the chance of live birth rate is assumed to be 36% with no pretreatment, the chance following long‐term GnRH agonist therapy would be between 9% and 31%. We are also uncertain whether this intervention affects complication rate, clinical pregnancy rate, multiple pregnancy rate, miscarriage rate, mean number of oocytes and mean number of embryos. No studies compared long‐term GnRH agonist therapy to long‐term continuous COC therapy or surgery to remove endometriomas. \\nQuality of the evidence \\nThe evidence was of very low quality. The main limitations in the evidence were lack of blinding (the process where the women participating in the trial, as well as the research staff, are not aware of the intervention used), inconsistency (differences between different studies) and imprecision (random error and small size of each study). \\n', '10.1002-14651858.CD013225.pub3-pls.txt': 'Treatments for seizures in catamenial (menstrual‐related) epilepsy\\nBackground \\nCatamenial (menstrual) epilepsy describes a worsening of seizures in relation to the menstrual cycle and may affect around 40% of women with epilepsy. There are specific times within the menstrual cycle when women are most at risk: in the days leading up to a menstrual period and during a menstrual period (perimenstrual or catamenial type 1 pattern); at the time of ovulation (catamenial type 2 pattern); and in the second half of their cycle (luteal phase, or catamenial type 3 pattern). The reason for this increased risk may relate to changes in the levels of progesterone (a hormone released by the ovaries) around the time of a menstrual period and oestrogen (a female sex hormone) surge around ovulation. Studies in animals have demonstrated that lower progesterone may affect how the brain reacts to the brain chemical gamma‐Aminobutyric acid (GABA), which is important in preventing seizures. The link between high levels of oestrogen and risk of seizures remains unclear. \\nCurrent treatment of catamenial epilepsy depends on whether a woman has regular or irregular menstrual periods. If a woman has regular periods, hormonal (e.g. progesterone supplements) and non‐hormonal treatments (e.g. clobazam or acetazolamide) taken prior to and during a period may be used. In women who do not have regular periods, and who therefore cannot predict their period days, stopping periods using synthetic hormones (e.g. medroxyprogesterone (Depo‐Provera) or gonadotropin‐releasing hormone (GnRH) analogues (triptorelin and goserelin)) are treatment options. \\nCatamenial epilepsy is common in women with epilepsy, and may have a significant negative impact on quality of life. Women may not receive appropriate treatment for their catamenial seizures. There is uncertainty regarding which treatment works best and when in the menstrual cycle treatments should be taken. There are also concerns about the possible impact on fertility, the menstrual cycle, bone health, and cardiovascular health. This review aimed to address these issues in order to inform clinical practice and future research. \\nObjectives \\nThe aim of this review was to examine the effectiveness of hormonal and non‐hormonal treatments in stopping seizures in women with catamenial epilepsy. \\nMethods \\nWe searched electronic databases to find relevant studies in which treatment was continued for at least 12 weeks. Our outcomes of interest were: average change in seizures, percentage of women achieving a reduction in seizures by at least 50%, and percentage of women who became seizure‐free. We also examined the reasons why women dropped out of the studies and any reported side effects. \\nResults \\nWe included four randomised controlled trials (studies in which participants are randomly assigned to one of two or more treatment groups) of hormonal treatments in the review, two trials evaluating progesterone and two evaluating norethisterone. In all of these studies, the treatment was compared to a placebo (a harmless sugar pill). We did not find any studies testing non‐hormonal treatments or any studies in women with irregular periods. The four included studies involved a total of 192 women aged between 13 and 45 years experiencing catamenial epilepsy. The included studies did not demonstrate any significant differences between groups when comparing progesterone or norethisterone to placebo for seizure outcomes. The included studies reported limited information on side effects, but women taking progesterone were no more likely to withdraw from the study due to side effects than those receiving placebo. \\nThe evidence is current to July 2021.\\nCertainty of the evidence \\nWe judged the certainty of the evidence to be very low to moderate, as the included studies provided unclear information on methods of blinding, recruited small numbers of participants, and were inconsistent in reporting treatment outcomes. \\nConclusions \\nWe found very limited, mostly low‐certainty evidence, of no difference in seizure outcomes for norethisterone and progesterone versus placebo in women with catamenial epilepsy. Our review highlights an overall lack of information on the effectiveness of a wide range of other hormonal and non‐hormonal treatments currently being used. Further studies in women with catamenial epilepsy are needed in this area. \\n', '10.1002-14651858.CD006251.pub4-abstract.txt': \"Interventions to reduce injuries in construction workers\\nOccupational injury rates among construction workers are the highest among the major industries. While various organisations have proposed several injury control strategies, their effectiveness for reducing the rate of injuries in the construction industry remains uncertain. \\nWhat is the aim of this review? \\nTo find out which interventions are most effective for reducing on‐the‐job injuries in construction workers. \\nKey messages \\nWe conducted a systematic search of the literature on preventing occupational injuries among construction workers. We included 17 studies in this updated review, rating the evidence as very low quality. Multifaceted interventions and company incentives for upgrading equipment may be effective in reducing injury. However, an evidence base is still needed for the vast majority of safety measures that safety manuals, consultants and safety courses routinely recommend. \\nWhat was studied in the review? \\nWe looked at different types of workplace interventions, including the introduction of new regulations, safety campaigns, training, inspections, occupational health services, and company subsidies. We evaluated the quality of the studies and the effectiveness of interventions, rating the evidence as very low quality. \\nWhat are the main results of the review? \\nIntroducing regulations alone may or may not be effective for preventing non‐fatal and fatal injuries in construction workers. Regionally oriented interventions such as a safety campaigns, training, inspections or occupational health services may not be effective for reducing non‐fatal injuries in construction workers. However, a multifaceted safety campaign and a multifaceted drug‐free workplace programme at the company level, along with subsidies for replacement of scaffoldings, may be effective in reducing non‐fatal injuries. \\nAdditional strategies are needed to increase the employers' and workers' adherence to the safety measures that are prescribed by regulation. \\nHow up‐to‐date is this review? \\nWe searched for studies that had been published up to 1 April 2017.\\n\", '10.1002-14651858.CD012626.pub2-abstract.txt': \"What are the most effective ways to encourage people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) to be more physically active? \\nBackground \\nBeing physically active is important for everyone's health. It can be particularly difficult for people with COPD and we do not know the best way to improve physical activity. \\nStudy characteristics \\nThis review includes 76 studies involving 8018 people with COPD (published before 27 June 2019). Most studies were funded by government bodies, although some were sponsored by equipment or drug manufacturers. Many strategies have been developed and different studies have measured physical activity in lots of different ways. This means that it was hard to compare and combine their findings. It was also hard to tell exactly what was involved in some of the interventions, and therefore which components were important for improving physical activity. \\nKey results \\nSome studies looked at current interventions for people with COPD, including pulmonary rehabilitation and different types of exercise training as well as self‐management and education. Other studies have looked at special types of nutritional supplements, oxygen therapy, surgery, muscle stimulation and singing. \\nSome strategies that did work involved exercise training, physical activity counselling and COPD medications. Some studies showed that people did an extra 6 to 24 minutes of at least moderate‐intensity physical activity, as well as walking for longer or taking more steps each day. However, we are still uncertain about when or how these approaches should be used. Only a few studies followed people up after the intervention finished. It is not clear exactly what needs to be done to improve physical activity in the long term, which is what may be required for health benefits. \\nQuality of the evidence \\nThe quality of evidence was generally low, due to difficulties working out exactly what people did in the studies, and also because there were lots of single studies (some quite small) looking at different types of interventions. This means that it was difficult to generalise these findings to all people with COPD. \\n\", '10.1002-14651858.CD013212.pub2-pls.txt': 'Screening strategies for hypertension\\nReview question \\nWhat effects do the different ways of screening for hypertension (mass, targeted, or opportunistic) have in decreasing illness and death? \\nBackground \\nHypertension is a long‐term non‐communicable disease (NCD), also known as high, raised, or elevated blood pressure. Blood pressure is expressed by two measurements (systolic (SBP) and diastolic (DBP) pressures), which are the maximum and minimum pressures. High blood pressure is generally diagnosed when resting blood pressure is persistently at SBP ≥ 130/140 millimetres mercury (mmHg) or at DBP ≥ 80/90 mmHg for adults. \\nEven though blood pressure in the arteries is continuously raised, in many cases, high blood pressure does not cause symptoms. Nonetheless, hypertension can increase the risk for heart failure, stroke, vision loss, and chronic kidney disease, and so on, in the long term. People who have unhealthy diets, consume harmful amounts of alcohol and/or tobacco, and are physically inactive are at higher risk of hypertension. \\nEarly detection, adequate treatment, and good control of high blood pressure can lower the risk of complications associated with hypertension. Although early detection through screening of hypertension has the potential to contain health‐related costs, reducing the burden of hypertension will to some extent involve addressing behavioural and socioeconomic risk factors (such as income, occupation, and level of education). Therefore, it is unclear whether early detection of mild hypertension can positively impact health‐related costs in the long term and improve health outcomes by reducing the need for hospitalisation and management of hypertension‐related complications, which can be severe. \\nReview methods \\nWe searched various electronic databases on this topic until 9 April 2020. We searched for studies written in any language, whether published or not. We planned to include studies that compared one type of screening strategy for hypertension versus no screening strategy, that is, mass screening versus no screening, targeted screening versus no screening, and opportunistic screening versus no screening. We were interested in studies in which participants were healthy adolescents, adults, and elderly people, and in which researchers measured clinical outcomes, health system outcomes, and adverse events. \\nKey results \\nWe found no studies that met the criteria described above.\\nQuality of the evidence \\nHigh‐certainty evidence that can tell us whether mass, targeted, or opportunistic screening strategies are effective for reducing illness and death associated with hypertension is lacking. \\n', '10.1002-14651858.CD013247.pub2-pls.txt': \"What are the benefits and risks of ocrelizumab for multiple sclerosis?\\nKey messages \\n– Ocrelizumab is a recently approved medicine to treat people with multiple sclerosis (MS). In relapsing‐remitting MS (where people experience flare‐ups of symptoms), ocrelizumab probably substantially reduces flare‐ups, may substantially reduce worsening of symptoms, and probably makes little or no difference to unwanted effects compared with interferon beta‐1a (a standard treatment for MS), 96 weeks after treatment starts. \\n– Compared to placebo (a dummy medicine) after 120 weeks of treatment for primary progressive MS (where people's symptoms worsen gradually), ocrelizumab may reduce worsening of symptoms.

This damage prevents messages travelling from the central nervous system to other parts of the body. It causes a range of potential symptoms from pins and needles to difficulties with balance and walking.\\xa0 \\nThere are several types of MS. In relapsing‐remitting MS, people have 'flare‐ups' of disease followed by periods of recovery. In primary progressive MS, people's symptoms gradually worsen over time.\\xa0 \\nWhat is ocrelizumab? \\nOcrelizumab is a medicine that has been recently approved to treat relapsing‐remitting MS and primary progressive MS. It is a disease‐modifying therapy, which is a type of medicine that treats the underlying symptoms of MS. Ocrelizumab targets white blood cells in the body's immune system. It sticks to a type of these cells called B cells, and stops them attacking the central nervous system. This prevents inflammation and nerve damage, reducing the number and severity of relapses and slowing the worsening of symptoms. \\nWhat did we want to find out? \\nWe wanted to find out if ocrelizumab is more effective than any other medicine or placebo in people with relapsing‐remitting MS and primary progressive MS. \\nWe were interested in how many people:\\n– had symptom flare‐ups;\\n– had worsening symptoms;\\n– experienced unwanted effects; and\\n– stopped treatment due to unwanted effects.\\nWhat did we do? \\nWe searched for studies that compared ocrelizumab against any other medicine or placebo for people with a confirmed diagnosis of relapsing‐remitting MS or primary progressive MS.

First, people dropped out of the studies unevenly, which meant more people had one treatment than the other. Second, there was not enough information about some of our points of interest to allow us to draw conclusions for outcomes, there was not enough information available for us to be confident in the results. Finally, changes in symptoms shown by scans could have been due to causes other than disease progression. \\nHow up‐to‐date is this evidence? \\nThe evidence is up‐to‐date to 8 October 2021.\\n\", '10.1002-14651858.CD011749.pub2-abstract.txt': \"Medicines to treat delirium in critically ill adult patients\\nReview question \\nWe reviewed the evidence from randomized controlled trials for the benefits and safety of all prescription medicines used to treat critically ill adult patients with delirium in the intensive care units (ICUs) of hospitals. \\nBackground \\nDelirium is commonly associated with surgery, infection, or critical illness. It is experienced as new‐onset, generally short‐term inability to think clearly. Patients with delirium shift between periods of clear thinking and periods of agitation and/or great sleepiness and confusion. Lack of sleep, pain, a noisy environment, physical restraint, and the use of sedatives and strong analgesics are some of the contributing factors. Delirium affects both immediate and longer‐term health outcomes of critically ill patients as it can increase the length of time a breathing machine is required, time spent in the ICU and in hospital, and the chance of functional weakening and death. The odds of a poor outcome with delirium are increased with frail patients and those of advanced age and already present cognitive difficulties. Frequently, delirious ICU patients are given medicines to help treat symptoms such as agitation. \\nStudy characteristics \\nThis review is current to 21 March 2019. We found 14 randomized controlled studies that enrolled a total of 1844 adult participants. Six different classes of medicines were tested. These were antipsychotic drugs used as tranquillizers in ten studies; the sedative alpha2 agonist dexmedetomidine in three studies; statins that reduce cholesterol in two studies; opioids as part of pain management in one study; serotonin antagonists for nausea and vomiting in one study; and cholinesterase inhibitors, which are medicines for Alzheimer's disease, in one study. Ten studies compared medicine to placebo ‐ an inactive medicine also known as a sugar pill; four studies compared different drugs. Eleven studies with 1153 participants reported on the main outcome of this review ‐ duration of delirium. \\nKey findings \\nWhen drug classes were directly compared with placebo, only the alpha2 agonist dexmedetomidine was found to reduce the duration of delirium, and the cholinesterase inhibitor rivastigmine was found to prolong the duration of delirium. Each of these results is based on findings from a single small study. The other drugs when compared to placebo did not change delirium duration. The Review authors used the statistical method of network meta‐analysis to compare the six different drug classes. Dexmedetomidine was ranked most effective in reducing delirium duration, followed by atypical antipsychotics. However, network meta‐analysis of delirium duration failed to rule out the possibility of no difference for all six drug classes compared to placebo. Using this method, we did not find that any drug improved the duration of coma, length of stay, long‐term cognitive outcomes, or death. The alpha2 agonist dexmedetomidine shortened time spent on a breathing machine. Adverse events often were not reported in these trials or were rare when reported. An analysis of reported events showed that events were similar to those reported with placebo. We found 10 ongoing studies and six studies awaiting classification that, once published and assessed, may change the conclusions of this review. \\nQuality of the evidence \\nMost of the included studies were small but of good design.

In cases of severe AKI, kidney replacement therapy/dialysis (KRT) using circuits is necessary. Continuous kidney replacement therapy is performed continuously over 24 hours. Clotting of the CKRT circuit can interfere with this treatment. To prevent this, a variety of non‐pharmacological (not using medication) interventions have been studied. We aimed to summarise current evidence regarding the efficacy of non‐pharmacological interventions for preventing clotting of extracorporeal circuits during CKRT. \\nWhat did we do? \\nWe searched for available evidence from the Cochrane Kidney and Transplant Specialised Register up to 25 January 2021. Our review summarised the results of 20 randomised studies involving a total of 1143 people. \\nWhat did we find? \\nWe found that the quality of the 20 included studies was low, and the number randomised was small. The majority of the included studies did not report death as an outcome. We found that continuous venovenous haemodiafiltration (CVVHDF), as compared with continuous venovenous haemofiltration (CVVH), may prolong circuit lifespan. In addition, pre‐dilution haemofiltration, as compared with post‐dilution haemofiltration, a longer catheter placing the tip at the right atrium, as compared with a shorter catheter placing the tip in the superior vena cava, and surface‐modified double lumen catheter, as compared with standard double lumen catheter, may extend the circuit lifespan. However, higher blood flow compared to standard blood flow rate might not affect circuit lifespan. Overall, the data was limited and of very low certainty. \\nConclusions \\nWe found that the effects of non‐pharmacological interventions in people with AKI receiving CKRT remain unclear. There is a need for studies assessing CKRT circuit lifespan as well as other clinically important outcomes. \\n', '10.1002-14651858.CD013365.pub2-pls.txt': \"CAR T‐cell therapy for people with diffuse large B‐cell lymphoma which returns after treatment or no longer responds to treatment \\nBackground \\nDiffuse large B‐cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is a fast‐growing cancer of the lymphatic system, an important part of the immune system. It affects blood cells that produce antibodies to fight infections. \\nDLBCL is potentially curable. Most people with DLBCL respond well to initial therapies such as chemotherapy. For some people, the disease becomes refractory, which means it no longer responds to treatment, or it relapses, which means it returns after treatment. As a second‐line treatment, people with DLBCL can receive chemotherapy coupled with stem‐cell transplantation, but not all people are candidates for this therapy. From those who are, around 50% experience relapse after treatment. People who relapse or are refractory to advanced lines of treatment and those who are not candidates for a stem‐cell transplant have a very poor prognosis: Only half of them survive longer than six to 12 months. \\nA promising treatment for these people is 'chimeric antigen receptor' (CAR) T‐cell therapy, which utilises the body's own immune cells (T‐cells) to fight DLBCL. T‐cells are removed from the person's blood, equipped with so‐called 'chimeric antigen receptors' (CARs), that help to recognise and destroy the cancer cells, in the laboratory and then delivered back into the person's blood. \\nWhat was our aim? \\nWe wanted to explore whether CAR T‐cells are an effective treatment for people with DLBCL that returns after treatment (relapses) or no longer responds to treatment (is refractory). We also wanted to explore the frequency of unwanted effects associated with CAR T‐cell therapy. \\nWhat did we do? \\nWe searched for all available clinical studies on treatment with CAR T‐cells for people with relapsed or refractory DLBCL to summarise the current evidence. We also evaluated the risk of bias in included studies and rated our confidence in the evidence. \\nWhat did we find? \\nWe found 13 studies with information on 679 participants (who had received several prior lines of therapy) that received CAR T‐cell therapy. None of the studies had a control group. This means CAR T‐cells were not compared with another treatment. We decided not to meta‐analyse the study results and reported all results narratively. We also found 38 ongoing studies. \\nWhat are the key results? \\nEight studies with 567 participants evaluated overall survival. After 12 months, around half of participants were alive in four studies. In one study, around half of participants were alive after 24 months. The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of CAR T‐cells on survival. \\nTwo studies (294 participants at study start; 59 participants at study end) reported that quality of life improved over time. The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of CAR T‐cells on quality of life. \\nDeaths related to the therapy were not reported.\\nFive studies (550 participants) reported on adverse events. Almost all participants (99% to 100%) experienced some kind of adverse event (including mild events). Between 68% and 98% of participants had adverse events that were severe. CAR T‐cells may increase the risk of adverse events but the evidence about the exact risk is very uncertain. \\nIn three studies (253 participants), 56% to 68% of participants experienced serious adverse events, while in one study (28 participants), participants had no serious adverse events. CAR T‐cells may increase the risk of serious adverse events but the evidence about the exact risk is very uncertain. \\nEleven studies (675 participants) reported on the frequency of 'cytokine release syndrome' (CRS), an overreaction of the immune system that is typically seen in CAR T‐cell therapy. It includes fever and can include symptoms such as chills, muscle pain or dizziness. Several scales were used across the studies to describe CRS. In five studies using the same scale, between 42% and 100% of participants had CRS. CAR T‐cells may increase the risk of CRS but the evidence about the exact risk is very uncertain. \\nNine studies (575 participants) reported when DLBCL relapsed (returned) or progressed (got worse). Four studies reported that, at 12 months, DLBCL did not progress in 44% to 75% of participants. In one study, 64% of participants did not relapse at both 12, and 18 months. The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of CAR T‐cells on DLBCL relapse or progress. \\nThirteen studies (620 participants) reported how many participants had a complete response (all signs of cancer disappeared). In three studies, between 40% and 45% of participants experienced a complete response at six months. The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of CAR T‐cells on complete response. \\nWhat does this mean? \\nThe evidence on CAR T‐cells in the treatment of relapsed or refractory DLBCL is very uncertain. This is mainly because, today, there are no direct comparisons of CAR T‐cells with other treatments. People who receive CAR T‐cells can have severe adverse events that require additional treatment. We identified many ongoing studies and some of them compare CAR T‐cells with standard care. We will keep evaluating the evidence on this novel therapy. \\nHow up‐to‐date is this review? \\nThe evidence is current to September 2020.\\n\", '10.1002-14651858.CD006237.pub4-abstract.txt': \"What are the best ways to help people with depression go back to work?\\nWhat is depression? \\nDepression is a common mental health problem that can cause a persistent feeling of sadness and loss of interest in people, activities, and things that were once enjoyable. A person with depression may feel tearful, irritable, or tired most of the time, and may have problems with sleep, concentration, and memory. \\nDepression may affect people's ability to work. People with depression may be absent from work (off sick), or feel less able to cope with working. \\nGoing back to work \\nReducing depressive symptoms may help people with depression to go back to work. Treatments include medications and psychological (talking) therapies, or a combination of both. Changes at the workplace could also help, such as: \\nchanging a person's tasks or working hours;\\nsupporting them in a gradual return to work; or\\nhelping them to cope better with certain work situations.\\nWhy we did this Cochrane Review \\nWork can improve a person's physical and mental well‑being; it helps build confidence and self‐esteem, allows people to socialise, and provides money. We wanted to find out if workplace changes and clinical programmes could help people with depression to return to work. \\nWhat did we do? \\nWe searched for studies that looked at whether workplace changes and clinical programmes affected the amount of sick leave taken by people with depression. Clinical programmes included: medicines (anti‐depressants); psychological therapies; improved healthcare by doctors; and other programmes such as exercise and diet.\\xa0 \\nSearch date: we included evidence published up to 4 April 2020. \\nWhat we found \\nWe found 45 studies in 12,109 people with depression. The studies took place in Europe (34\\xa0studies), the USA (8), Australia (2) and Canada (1). \\nThe effects of 'care as usual' were compared with those of workplace changes and clinical programmes to find out: \\nhow many days people with depression were on sick leave\\nhow many people with depression were off work;\\npeople's symptoms of depression; and\\nhow well people with depression could cope with their work.\\nWhat are the results of our review? \\nOur main findings within the first year of follow‐up, for workplace changes or treatments compared with usual care, are listed below. \\nWorkplace changes combined with a clinical programme:\\nprobably reduce the number of days on sick leave (on average, by 25 days for each person over one year; 9 studies; 1292\\xa0participants); \\ndo not reduce the number of people off work (2 studies; 1025\\xa0participants);\\nmay reduce symptoms of depression (8 studies; 1091 participants); and\\nmay improve ability to cope with work (5 studies; 926 participants).\\nWorkplace changes alone:\\nmay increase the number of days on sick leave (2\\xa0studies, 130\\xa0participants);\\nprobably do not lead to more people off work (1 study; 226\\xa0participants);\\nprobably do not affect symptoms of depression (4 studies; 390 participants); and\\nmay not improve ability to cope with work (1 study; 48 participants).\\nImproved healthcare alone:\\nprobably reduces the number of days on sick leave, by 20 days (in two, well‐conducted studies in 692 participants, although not in all 7\\xa0studies, in 1912\\xa0participants); \\nprobably reduces symptoms of depression (7 studies; 1808 participants); and\\nmay reduce ability to cope with work (1 study; 604 participants).\\nPsychological therapies alone:\\nmay reduce the number of days off work, by 15 days (9 studies; 1649\\xa0participants); and \\nmay reduce symptoms of depression (8 studies; 1255 participants).\\nWe are uncertain if psychological therapies alone affect people's ability to cope with work (1\\xa0study; 58 participants). \\nHow reliable are these results? \\nOur confidence in these results is mostly moderate to low. Some findings are based on small numbers of studies, in small numbers of participants. We also found limitations in the ways some studies were designed, conducted and reported. \\nKey messages \\nCombining workplace changes with a clinical programme probably helps people with depression to return to work more quickly and to take fewer days off sick. We need more evidence to assess which combination of workplace changes and clinical programmes works best. \\nImproved healthcare probably also helps people with depression to take fewer days off sick. \\n\", '10.1002-14651858.CD013390.pub2-pls.txt': 'What are the benefits and risks of different surgical procedures for infantile nystagmus syndrome (an eye disorder that develops shortly after birth)? \\nWhy is this question important?Infantile nystagmus syndrome (INS) is an eye disorder that causes involuntary movement of the eyes from side to side, up and down, or in circles. INS typically develops shortly after birth, and persists throughout life. It is often associated with visual problems, such as:‐ long‐sightedness (when people can see distant objects clearly, but near objects appear blurred);‐\\xa0or\\xa0short‐sightedness (when people can see near objects clearly, but distant objects appear blurred). \\nThere is currently no cure for INS. However, it is possible to reduce eye movement and improve people’s vision. One of the main options is eye surgery, which involves operating on the muscles that control eye movement. Several different surgical procedures can be used: some procedures involve detaching and reattaching the eye muscles, whereas others require complete removal of these muscles.\\xa0\\xa0 \\nIt is unclear whether some surgical procedures for INS have more benefits or risks than others. To find out which surgical procedures work best, we reviewed the evidence from research studies. We were particularly interested in whether different surgical procedures could improve vision and quality of life in people with INS. We also wanted to know about any adverse (unwanted) effects. \\nHow did we identify and evaluate the evidence?First, we searched for randomised controlled studies, in which people were randomly divided into two or more treatment groups. This makes it less likely that any differences between treatment effects were actually due to differences in the people who received them (rather than due to the treatments themselves, which is what we wanted to find out). \\nWe then compared the results, and summarised the evidence from all the studies. Finally, we rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes, and the consistency of findings across studies. \\nWhat did we find?We found one study, set in India, that involved a total of 10 people with INS who were followed for six months after surgery. The study authors did not report any information about:\\xa0‐\\xa0the age and gender of the people who took part in it;‐ or\\xa0the source of funding for the study. \\nThe study compared two different surgical procedures:\\xa0‐\\xa0one procedure in which two horizontal rectus muscles (eye muscles that control side‐to‐side eye movements) were moved from their original position to a position further back on the eyeball; and‐\\xa0another procedure in which four horizontal rectus muscles were detached and reattached, in their original position.The procedures were conducted in both eyes. \\nThe study compared the effects of the treatments on:‐\\xa0clarity of vision six months after surgery;‐\\xa0intensity of eye movement six months after surgery;‐\\xa0adverse events six months after surgery; and‐\\xa0quality of life. \\xa0 \\nThe study did not investigate the effects of treatments on:‐\\xa0head posture;‐\\xa0the amount of time when the eye is still; or‐\\xa0the time it takes to recognise objects. \\nWe have very little confidence in the evidence from the study we found, because:‐\\xa0it is based on a very small number of people; and‐ the patients and researchers in the study knew which type of surgery each patient received. This knowledge may have influenced the study results. \\nWe therefore cannot determine whether the two procedures investigated in the study had different benefits and risks. \\nWhat does this mean?There is insufficient evidence to determine whether some surgical procedures are better than others for INS. We need researchers to conduct robust randomised controlled trials in future, so that we can compare different procedures. This would help clinicians, and people with INS, to make treatment decisions based on evidence from research. \\nHow‐up‐to date is this review?The evidence in this Cochrane Review is current to July 2020. \\n', '10.1002-14651858.CD013218.pub2-pls.txt': 'Rapid tests for diagnosing malaria caused by Plasmodium vivax in people living in areas where malaria is very common \\nWhat is the aim of the review? \\nMalaria infection is caused mainly by two species of malaria parasite: Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax. The aim of this review was to evaluate rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) to diagnose P vivax infection. \\nWhy are rapid tests for P vivax malaria important? \\nFor clinical management, knowing which parasite species is causing the malaria is important as the drug treatments differ. For P vivax infection, an additional drug is required to eliminate the infection from the liver. For public health control of malaria, we know that P falciparum is declining over the previous 15 years, and infections from P vivax have therefore increased in importance. \\nWhat was studied in this review? \\nRDTs provide results quickly and are often as a dipstick. We studied RDTs that specifically test for P vivax malaria. RDTs are simple to use, point‐of‐care tests. They are suitable for use in rural settings by primary healthcare workers, using drop of blood on the dipstick that causes colour change and a distinct line that indicates a positive test result. Healthcare workers in rural areas can perform RDTs for P vivax without needing a laboratory or special equipment. We wanted to find out which brands of RDTs were the most accurate for diagnosing P vivax malaria. We compared the new tests against the standard form of diagnosis with microscopy, and also more recent methods polymerase chain reaction (PCR): a molecular method to identify P vivax DNA in blood samples. \\nWhat are the main results of the review? \\nWe included 10 studies that looked at the accuracy of six diagnostic test brands for detecting P vivax malaria in people with suspected malaria symptoms. The studies were conducted in Ethiopia (four studies), India (two studies) and Bangladesh, Brazil, Colombia, and Sudan (one study each). \\nCompared with microscopy, the Care Start Malaria Pf/Pv Combo test performed well with 99% sensitivity and specificity (four studies). This means that: \\n• for every 100 people tested who have P vivax malaria, one person will have a negative test result, and might not receive the right treatment soon enough; \\n• for every 100 people tested who do not have P vivax malaria, one will have a positive result, and might receive unnecessary treatment. \\nCompared with microscopy, the Falcivax Device Rapid test had a sensitivity of 77% and a specificity of 99% (two studies). This means that: \\n• For every 100 people tested who have P vivax malaria, 23 people will have a negative test result; and, \\n• for every 100 people tested who do not have P vivax malaria, one person will have a positive result. \\nWe are moderately confident (certain) in the accuracy results for the Care Start Malaria Pf/Pv Combo test. The results are from a small number of studies (four), so our findings may change when results from further studies become available. \\nWe are less confident in the accuracy results for the Falcivax Device Rapid test, because these came from only two studies. Our findings for this test will probably change when results from further studies become available. \\nOur results are based on a small number of studies, so we could not reliably assess all six brands of antibody test or compare their accuracy. Most studies included in this review had limitations: it was not clear how people were selected for testing, or how the study results were assessed and checked, which could have affected the results. Some rapid antibody tests were investigated by only one study. Some studies did not report clearly how common P malaria was in the area where the study was done. \\nHow up‐to‐date is this review? \\nThe review authors searched for studies published up to 30 July 2019.\\n', '10.1002-14651858.CD011462.pub2-abstract.txt': 'Use of shorter radiation treatments for prostate cancer\\nReview question \\nWe asked if giving radiation therapy (cancer treatment with high energy x‐rays) for localized prostate cancer in fewer fractions (treatment visits for radiation) and shorter overall treatment time with a larger dose (more than 2 Gray) given each day, works as well as the usual (conventional) number of fractions (1.8 Gray per day to 2 Gray per day) for cancer control and had similar side effects. \\nBackground \\nUsing fewer fractions, with a larger dose given at each visit is possibly better for treating prostate cancer with radiation. Radiation therapy for prostate cancer can cause bladder and bowel side effects, and affect sexual function. If using larger doses for each treatment, with fewer treatments overall (called hypofractionation), works as well for cancer control, and the side effects and effects on certainty of life are about the same, then hypofractionation may benefit men with prostate cancer contained within the prostate (localized) who are treated with radiation therapy. If cancer control is as good, and the side effects about the same, then using fewer (but larger dose) radiation treatments may be more convenient for men with prostate cancer, use fewer resources and save money. \\nStudy characteristics \\nThis evidence is current to 15 March 2019. The men studied were ages 64 years and over and had prostate cancer limited to the pelvis. \\nKey results \\nWe studied the use of fewer, but larger doses of radiation to treat 8278 men with prostate cancer.

Mental health promotion may, for example, involve a classroom‐based well‐being intervention for children. An example of prevention is trauma‐focused therapy to prevent post‐traumatic stress disorder. Treatment may, for example, include psychological therapy for depression. We found 23 systematic reviews and 15 protocols of reviews in progress. Together the 23 published systematic reviews included 336 references, 175 of which were unique studies. Reviews more commonly included refugees and asylum seekers than internally displaced persons, and were more frequently focused on adults than children. There was more attention on the treatment of post‐traumatic stress disorder than there was for mental health promotion or prevention, or for the treatment of depression or anxiety. Studies of Cognitive Behavioural Therapy, Narrative Exposure Therapy, and integrative and interpersonal therapies were most likely to be included in reviews. \\nThe quality of reviews was limited by a range of issues, many of which related to poor reporting of the review methodology. \\nThe evidence available from systematic reviews may not match the need for evidence‐based interventions for the mental health of involuntary migrants.

Venous leg ulcers can cause distress and pain to patients, and can be very costly to the health service. \\nWhat did we want to find out? \\nStandard treatment options for venous leg ulcers often include compression therapy. This involves applying external pressure around the lower leg to help the return of blood from the legs to the heart. Compression therapy uses bandages, stockings or other devices. \\nWe wanted to find out if compression therapy delivered by bandages and stockings compared with no compression: \\n‐ heals venous leg ulcers;\\n‐ has any unwanted effects;\\n‐ improves people’s quality of life;\\n‐ has health benefits that outweigh the costs (cost‐effectiveness); and\\n‐ reduces pain.\\nWhat did we do? \\nWe searched for randomised controlled trials (clinical studies where the treatment or care people receive is chosen at random).

The vast majority (90%) of these injuries are temporary and get better within eight weeks. However if they last for longer than six months they are considered to be permanent. Damage to these nerves can lead to altered sensation in the region of the lower lip and chin, or tongue or both. Furthermore, damage to the nerve supplying the tongue may lead to altered taste perception. These injuries can affect people's quality of life leading to emotional problems, problems with socialising and disabilities. Accidental injury after surgery can also give rise to legal action. \\nThere are many interventions or treatments available, surgical and non‐surgical, that may enhance recovery, including improving sensation. They can be grouped as. \\n1. Surgical – a variety of procedures. 2. Laser treatment – low‐level laser treatment has been used to treat partial loss of sensation. 3. Medical – treatment with drugs including antiepileptics, antidepressants and painkillers. 4. Counselling – including cognitive behavioural and relaxation therapy, changing behaviour and hypnosis. \\nStudy characteristics \\nThe Cochrane Oral Health Group carried out this review, and the evidence is current as of 9 October 2013. There are two studies included, both published in 1996, which compared low‐level laser treatment to placebo or fake treatment for partial loss of sensation following surgery to the lower jaw. There were 15 participants in one study and 16 in the other, their ages ranging from 17 to 55 years. All had suffered accidental damage to nerves of the lower jaw and tongue causing some loss of sensation following surgery. \\nKey results \\nLow‐level laser therapy was the only treatment to be evaluated in the included studies and this was compared to fake or placebo laser therapy. No studies were found that evaluated other surgical, medical or counselling treatments. \\nThere was some evidence of an improvement when participants reported whether or not sensation was better in the lip and chin areas with low‐level laser therapy. This is based on the results of a single, small study, so the results should be interpreted with caution. \\nNo studies reported on the effects of the treatment on other outcomes such as pain, difficulty eating or speaking or taste.

Traditionally it has been thought to have clinical benefits for patients with angina, including the reduction of the occurrence of acute myocardial infarction (AMI), and complications of some types of heart surgery. Some studies also suggest a possible benefit in reducing the frequency and severity of angina attacks and improving symptoms. However, none of these individual studies have been reviewed systematically. \\nThe review authors systematically reviewed evidence from 18 randomised controlled trials for the benefit of tongxinluo with or without other treatments, including routine care or placebo, for patients with unstable angina. All the trials were conducted in China. The total number of participants was 1413, ranging in age from 25 to 88 years. Most studies randomised patients to receive tongxinluo with conventional medication or conventional medications alone. \\nThere was some evidence from seven studies that tongxinluo improved the electrocardiogram (ECG) changes indicating ischaemia and reduced the number of people with no improvement or worsening of ECG (six studies). Some improvement in angina symptoms (10 studies) and reduced numbers of people showing no improvement or worsening of symptoms were apparent with tongxinluo.

A clinical diagnosis of dementia usually involves brain scans, physical examinations and history taking. As a first step, we often use memory and thinking tests to identify people who need further assessment. Traditionally these tests are performed in‐person, but modifications of the tests allow them to be used over the telephone or via video calls – sometimes called 'remote assessment'. \\nThe need for remote assessment has become particularly urgent due to COVID‐19. However, there are potential benefits of remote assessment beyond the COVID‐19 pandemic. Physically attending appointments can be difficult for some people and remote assessments offer greater convenience. Remote assessments are also useful in research, as a large number of people can be reached in a fairly short amount of time. \\nA test delivered by telephone may not be as good as the in‐person equivalent, and getting these tests right is important. One the one hand, If a test suggests someone has dementia when they do not (called a false positive), this can have an emotional impact on the person and their family. On the other hand, not identifying memory and thinking problems when they are present (called a false negative), mean that the person does not get the treatment and support that they need. \\nWhat was the aim of this review? \\nWe aimed to assess whether memory and thinking tests carried out by telephone or video call can detect dementia. \\nWhat was studied in this review? \\nWe looked at various memory and thinking tests. Many tests have been developed over time and they differ in their content and application, but most are based on a modification of a traditional in‐person test. \\nWhat were the main results of this review? \\nThe review included 31 studies, using 19 different memory tests, with a total of 3075 participants. \\nOnly seven tests were relevant to our question regarding accuracy of remote testing. With the limited number of studies, estimates on the accuracy of these tests are imprecise. Our review suggests that remote tests could correctly identify people with dementia between 26% and 100% of the time, and could correctly rule out dementia 65% to 100% of the time. \\nThe remaining 24 studies compared a remote test with the face‐to‐face equivalent. These studies suggested that remote test scores usually agreed with in‐person testing, but this was not perfect. \\nHow reliable are the results of the studies in this review? \\nIn these studies, a clinical diagnosis of dementia was used as the reference (gold) standard. We identified a number of issues in the design, conduct and reporting of the studies. A particular issue was around the selection of participants for the studies. Studies often did not include people with hearing or language impairments that may have complicated remote testing. \\nWho do the results of this study apply to? \\nMost studies investigated older adults (over 65 years). The findings may not be representative of all older adults with dementia, as some studies only examined specific groups of people, for example, after stroke. The studies were usually performed in specialist centres by experts. So, we do not know how well these tests identify dementia in routine community practice. \\nWhat are the implications of this review? \\nThe review highlights the lack of high‐quality research describing accuracy of telephone‐ and video call‐based memory and thinking tests. There were many differences between the studies included in this review such as the type of test used, participants included, the setting in which the study is carried out and language studied. This made comparisons between studies difficult. Our review suggests that remote assessments and in‐person assessments are not always equivalent. In situations where access to in‐person assessment is difficult, remote testing could be used as a useful first step. Ideally, this should be followed up with an in‐person assessment before a diagnosis is made. Due to limited studies, and differences in the way studies were carried out, we cannot recommend one particular remote test for the assessment of dementia. \\nHow up to date is this review? \\nThis search was performed in June 2021.\\n\", '10.1002-14651858.CD013776.pub2-pls.txt': \"Blue light‐enhanced versus white light resection in the treatment of non‐muscle invasive bladder cancer \\nReview question \\nHow does a resection (surgical removal) of bladder cancer supported with a special visualization\\xa0method (blue light) compare to a standard resection with white light in people\\xa0in whom a tumor of the inner bladder wall is suspected? \\nBackground \\nIn people suspected of having bladder cancer, suspicious tissue is cut from the inner bladder wall using a special instrument inserted through the urethra\\xa0into the bladder.\\xa0However,\\xa0it is sometimes\\xa0difficult to tell what is normal bladder versus what is cancer.

Warfarin is an effective treatment which has been used for many years but needs to be closely monitored, especially at the beginning of treatment, as there is a wide variation in response to dose. Monitoring of the response to dose is done using an International Normalized Ratio (INR) and it is important that patients remain within a narrow range (typically 2 to 3 INR) due to the need to balance the goal of preventing blood clots with the risk of causing excessive bleeding. \\nThis review included 12 randomised controlled trials comparing different warfarin doses given to patients beginning warfarin treatment. Most of the studies had a high risk of bias so the results were interpreted with caution. \\nThose trials that were included compared loading doses in several different situations. The review authors divided the trials into four categories, 5 mg versus 10 mg initial doses (four studies), 5 mg versus other doses (two studies), 5 mg or 10 mg versus age adjusted doses (two studies), 5 mg or 10 mg versus genotype adjusted doses (four studies). \\nThe review authors concluded that there is still considerable uncertainty between the use of a 5 mg and a 10 mg loading dose for the initiation of warfarin. In the elderly, there is some evidence that lower initiation doses or age adjusted doses are more appropriate. However, there is insufficient evidence to warrant genotype adjusted dosing.

Symptoms include burning, dryness or uncomfortable sensations in the mouth and changes to taste, with no obvious underlying medical or dental cause. BMS is usually persistent and suffered long term, and can lead to a reduced quality of life (QoL). Currently, scientific research suggests that BMS is caused by underlying damage to the nerves. There are many treatments available including drugs for anxiety, other psychological conditions and increasing saliva production, protective barriers and treatments applied to the mouth surface amongst others. \\nStudy characteristics \\nThis review of studies was carried out through Cochrane Oral Health, and the evidence is current up to 31 December 2015. \\nWe found 23 studies (assessing 1121 people; 83% were women), published between 1995 and 2015 to include in this review. Twenty‐one studies assessed short‐term (up to three months) symptom relief, and four studies assessed long‐term (from three to six months) symptom relief. Seventeen studies provided information about side effect occurrence, seven studies assessed a measure of QoL, and two studies assessed changes in taste and feeling of dryness. \\nAll of the 23 treatments included in this review were compared to a placebo (fake treatment): antidepressants and antipsychotics (two studies), antiseizure drugs (one study), types of tranquillisers (four studies), saliva stimulants (one study), dietary supplements (12 studies), directed energy waves (one study), physical barriers (one study), psychological therapies (one study), and treatments applied to the mouth surface (five studies). \\nKey results \\nShort‐term symptom relief  \\nWe found evidence of short‐term symptom relief for directed energy waves (one study, 58 participants), a type of tranquilliser used topically (that is held in the mouth before being removed, and which also acts as an antiseizure drug) called clonazepam (two studies, 111 participants), thin plastic tongue covers (one study, 50 participants), and an antiseizure drug called gabapentin (one study, 100 participants). \\nThere was no difference in short‐term symptom relief found for antidepressants, saliva stimulants, and another type of tranquilliser used systemically (one that is swallowed) also called clonazepam. We were unable to show whether dietary supplements or treatments applied to the mouth surface provide symptom relief in the short term or not. \\nShort‐term relief was not reported for the single study that assessed a psychological therapy. \\nLong‐term symptom relief  \\nWe found evidence of long‐term symptom relief for psychological therapy (one study, 30 participants), chili pepper mouthrinse (one study, 18 participants) and the topical tranquilliser called clonazepam (one study, 66 participants). \\nWe found there was no difference in long‐term symptom relief for dietary supplements or treatments applied to the mouth surface. \\nStudies which assessed antidepressants, directed energy waves, saliva stimulants, antiseizure drugs, or physical barriers did not evaluate long‐term symptom relief. \\nChange in QoL  \\nThere was evidence of short‐term improvement in QoL for directed energy waves (one study, 58 patients), although no difference was found for antidepressants, tranquillisers, dietary supplements and physical barriers. No study assessed long‐term QoL changes. \\nChange in taste or feeling of dryness  \\nA few studies assessed short‐term change in taste or feeling of dryness (none evaluated these outcomes long‐term), but there was not enough evidence to judge the effects of treatment on these outcomes. \\nSide effects  \\nSide effects were more likely to be experienced with antidepressants (dizziness and drowsiness more likely: one study, 37 people), and with a dietary supplement called alpha lipoic acid (also known as ALA) with or without other ingredients (headaches more likely: two studies, 118 people; and upset stomachs more likely: three studies, 138 people). \\nQuality of the evidence  Overall, we found very low‐quality evidence for each short‐ and long‐term outcome we investigated (symptom relief; changes in QoL, taste and feeling of dryness; and side effects) in all types of assessed treatment: antidepressants and antipsychotics, antiseizure drugs, types of tranquillisers, saliva stimulants, dietary supplements, directed energy waves, physical barriers (except side effects, which was assessed as low quality), psychological therapies, and treatments applied to the mouth surface.

Cough augmentation techniques, such as manually assisted cough, bagging (using a self‐inflating bag commonly used for resuscitation), mechanical Cough Assist (a device that clears secretions by applying a positive pressure to the airway, then rapidly shifting to a negative pressure), 'frog' breathing (a method of breathing to help a person take in a bigger volume of air), and breathstacking (the person takes a number of sequential breaths in, stacking one breath on top of the other without breathing out in between breaths) aim to improve cough effectiveness, with the eventual aim of reducing the number or severity (or both) of chest infections, and improving the ability of people to perform daily activities (functional ability) and quality of life. \\nMethods \\nWe carried out a wide database search for studies of cough augmentation techniques in adults and children with chronic neuromuscular disorders. We selected studies that assigned people to the treatment(s) or treatment order by chance, as this study type provides the best evidence. \\nResults and quality of the evidence \\nWe found 11 studies with 287 people and several cough augmentation techniques. One study measured the long‐term effects of treatment, but was only published as an abstract without enough information to accurately analyse the study findings. Many included studies had problems with how they were performed, how their findings were reported, or both, which made it difficult to fully interpret their results. None of the studies reported on the outcomes we thought were the most important for making decisions about the effectiveness and safety of cough augmentation techniques. For example, the studies did not report on the number or duration of unscheduled hospital admissions for chest infections, survival, functional ability, or quality of life. The safety of cough augmentation techniques could not be determined. Some studies suggested that cough augmentation techniques may be better than an unassisted cough, but the results are very uncertain. There was not enough evidence to show that any one technique was better than another in improving cough effort. \\nConclusions and recommendation \\nThe findings of this review provided insufficient information to make decisions about when and how to use cough augmentation techniques in people with chronic neuromuscular disorders. There is currently very low certainty evidence for or against the safety and effectiveness of cough augmentation techniques in people with chronic neuromuscular diseases and more studies are needed. \\nThe evidence is up‐to‐date to 13 April 2020.\\n\", '10.1002-14651858.CD010299.pub2-abstract.txt': 'Benefits of patient‐reported measures of health and well‐being versus traditional follow‐up after treatment of gynaecological cancer \\nBackground \\nCancer is a leading cause of death worldwide.\\xa0The traditional method of follow‐up involves multiple visits to the hospital to check, for example, whether the cancer has come back (recurrence). This may cause anxiety among the patients and its cost effectiveness is questionable. Clinician and patient groups have asked for a consideration of alternative model approaches; since most recurrences are symptomatic, follow‐up of patients after treatment for gynaecological cancer may be accomplished by patient‐related outcome measures (PROMs) rather than routine follow‐up visits. PROMs is an umbrella term that covers a range of potential types of measurements, but is used specifically to refer to self reports by the patient of their health and well‐being. Use of PROMs as alternatives to follow‐up may have immense psychological benefits for the patient and cost benefit to the healthcare system. There is currently no evidence to determine whether PROMs are better or worse in helping women to live longer and better after gynaecological cancer rather than follow‐up visits. It is also unclear whether PROMs are \\xa0beneficial in terms of patient satisfaction or quality of life. \\nStudy Characteristics \\nWe performed an extensive literature search to identify randomised controlled studies that compared PROMs to routine follow up. \\nKey findings \\nNo studies suitable for inclusion in our review were found.

The most common is basal cell carcinoma (BCC). BCC is a localised cancer that can grow and destroy the skin around it. They rarely spread into the body like other cancers can. Very small or superficial low‐risk BCCs can generally be treated with treatments such as creams rather than surgery, while it is better to surgically remove BCCs that are more likely to grow and spread. Radiotherapy (a treatment where radiation is used to kill cancer cells) can also be used if BCCs are very large or cannot be removed by surgery. Cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC) is also usually a localised skin cancer. In a small proportion of cases it can spread to other parts of the body, so the best treatment is to remove it using surgery. Melanoma is one of the most dangerous forms of skin cancer as it has a higher potential to spread to other parts of the body, and so it is vital to recognise it and remove it early. If people with BCC do not receive the correct diagnosis (known as a false negative test result), their treatment can be delayed, making the surgical procedure more complicated. Diagnosing BCC when it is actually something else (a false positive result) may result in unnecessary treatment, surgery or other investigations and can cause the patient stress and anxiety. If BCC is incorrectly diagnosed in an individual who actually has an cSCC or melanoma, effective treatment can be delayed and this might lead to a greater chance that the cSCC or melanoma spreads to other organs in the body, which can be very serious. \\nWhat is the aim of the review? \\nThe aim of this Cochrane Review was to find out how accurate a technique called 'exfoliative cytology' is for diagnosing skin cancer. Researchers in Cochrane found nine studies to answer this question. Nine studies were concerned with the diagnosis of BCC, two with the diagnosis of cSCC and one with the diagnosis of melanoma. \\nWhat was studied in the review? \\nExfoliative cytology means scraping the surface of a possible skin cancer with a knife and then spreading a small layer of the scrape onto a glass slide so that the cells in the scrape can be stained and looked at under a microscope. It is less invasive than skin biopsy and quick to perform, with results available immediately. This could save patients an additional clinic visit to receive skin biopsy results. \\nWhat are the main results of the review? \\nThe review examined nine studies with a total of 1655 lesions (a mole or area of skin with an unusual appearance in comparison with the surrounding skin) that were given these final diagnoses*: 1120 BCCs, 41 cSCCs and 10 melanomas. \\nFor identifying BCC, seven studies show the effect of using exfoliative cytology to confirm BCC in lesions that doctors already suspected were BCCs. In a group of 1000 such lesions, of which 860 (86%) actually do have BCC, then: \\n‐ an estimated 853 people will have an exfoliative cytology result confirming that a BCC is present. Of these 14 (1.6%) will not actually have a BCC (false positive result); \\n‐ of the 147 people with an exfoliative cytology result indicating that no BCC is present, 21 (14%) will in fact actually have a BCC (false negative result). \\nOne study compared the accuracy of exfoliative cytology to using a hand‐held microscope (dermoscopy) for making a diagnosis of BCC but used a different method of removing cells and included patients with a higher risk of melanoma than found in the other eight studies. \\nThere was not enough evidence to determine the accuracy of exfoliative cytology for diagnosing cSCC or melanoma. \\nHow reliable are the results of the studies of this review? \\nThe small number of studies included in this review, poor description of how patients were selected to be included in the study, and limited information on how the test results were used to make diagnoses, reduces the reliability of our results. \\nThe studies did not explain how patients had been referred to have the exfoliative cytology test. Most important of all, the test was only used in people in whom doctors had already diagnosed a BCC just by looking at the skin lesion. In other words, the test was being used to confirm a doctor's diagnosis. Most studies did not include enough people with skin lesions that are similar in appearance to a BCC to be sure that this test correctly identifies a BCC. This may cause exfoliative cytology to appear more accurate than it would be in actual practice. \\nWho do the results of this review apply to? \\nStudies were conducted in the UK, across Europe and in Australia. Study authors rarely described patient characteristics, such as age and location of the lesion. The percentage of people included in the studies with a final diagnosis of BCC ranged from 18% to 90% (nine studies). For cSCC it was 4% and 18% (two studies), and for melanoma it was 5% (one study). It was not possible to tell from the studies how clinicians had decided that study participants had lesions that could be a skin cancer. \\nWhat are the implications of this review? \\nNo research has been done using exfoliative cytology to diagnose a skin cancer when a patient is first seen by a doctor. The results of this review suggest that exfoliative cytology can help to confirm BCC in patients with skin lesions that a doctor already suspects of being a BCC. This test could be useful for patients with BCCs that need non‐surgical treatments, such as radiotherapy, where a tissue diagnosis is needed before the treatment can be given. \\nHow up‐to‐date is this review? \\nThe review authors searched for and used studies published up to August 2016.\\n*In these studies, biopsy was the reference standard (means of establishing the final diagnosis). \\n\", '10.1002-14651858.CD013165.pub2-pls.txt': 'Are potassium treatments effective for reduce the excess of potassium among people with chronic kidney disease? \\nWhat is the issue? \\nHigh levels of potassium (a body salt) can build up with chronic kidney disease.

Dialysis can remove potassium from the blood, but for some patients levels can still be high. Patients with severe kidney failure who have not yet started dialysis may have high potassium levels. Treatments have been available for many years but can cause constipation and abdominal discomfort, which make them intolerable for many patients.

They generally do not cause medical problems, although many people seek medical advice. Symptoms may include pain, ankle swelling, tired legs, restless legs, night cramps, heaviness, itching and distress from their cosmetic appearance. Complications such as oedema (build‐up of fluid), pigmentation, inflammation (swelling, redness and pain) and ulceration (sores) can also develop. Compression stockings are often the first line of treatment and come in a variety of lengths from knee‐length to full tights, and apply different pressures to support the flow of blood in the veins. \\nStudy characteristics \\nWe included 13 studies involving 1021 participants with varicose veins who had not experienced venous ulceration in this review (search run May 2020). Five studies assessed compression stocking versus no compression stocking (for example no treatment or placebo stocking with no graduated elastic). Three of these studies used knee‐length stockings, one used full‐length stockings and one used full tights. Eight studies compared different types or pressures of knee‐length stockings. The stockings used in the studies exerted different levels of pressure. One study included only pregnant women, while other studies included people who had sought medical intervention for their varicose veins by being on surgical waiting lists, or attending vascular surgery or dermatology (skin care) clinics or outpatient departments. \\nKey results \\nParticipants considered their symptoms had improved when stockings were worn in the nine studies that assessed this outcome, but these assessments were not always made by comparing one treatment group of the trial with a control group in the same study and was therefore subject to bias. \\nTwo studies comparing stockings with placebo stockings measured physical signs; there was no clear difference between baseline and follow‐up for ankle circumference, while oedema was reduced in the stocking group compared with the placebo stocking group. Generally there were no clear differences between studies comparing two types of stockings for volume reduction and change in diameter (ways to measure oedema). \\nComplications or side effects ranged from sweating, itching, irritation, skin dryness and a feeling of tightness. There were no severe or long‐lasting side effects. \\nTwo studies comparing stockings with different stockings, and four studies comparing stockings with placebo/no treatment assessed compliance (whether the person used the stockings as directed). In the stocking versus different stocking studies, there was no clear difference between the stockings, with generally low levels of compliance reported. In the stocking versus placebo/no treatment group, three studies reported results. Of these, one study reported a high initial dropout rate with generally low levels of compliance. The other two studies reported generally good compliance in the stocking group. Some reasons provided for non‐compliance included discomfort, difficulty in putting the stockings on, appearance, not being effective and causing irritation. \\nFour studies that compared stockings with different stockings and two studies that compared stockings with placebo/no treatment assessed comfort, tolerance and acceptability of stockings. Comparing stockings with placebo/no treatment, comfort, tolerance and acceptability was affected by the study population. Compression tights were increasingly rejected by pregnant women as their pregnancy progressed, while in a study of non‐pregnant women, the stockings group showed no more hindrance of normal activities and daytime discomfort when compared with placebo stockings. In the stocking versus different stockings studies, two studies reported similar levels of tolerance and discomfort between the types of stocking. Discomfort was the main reason for indicating a preference for one type of stocking over another. \\nOne study assessed quality of life, showing no clear differences between the stocking and no stocking groups. \\nNo conclusions regarding the optimum length or pressure of compression stockings could be made as there were no conclusive results from the included studies.\\xa0 \\nCertainty of the evidence \\nThe certainty of the evidence was low or very low because of risk of bias due to poor reporting, not all studies assessed the same outcomes, they assessed them in different ways, or reported them in a way that they could be combined and analysed with other studies.

Cuffed tubes are used more frequently in older babies and children to reduce leaks of gas around the tube, the risk of aspiration (breathing food, saliva, or stomach contents into the airways or lungs), the need to change the tube, or the tube coming out. \\nReview question: in this review, we evaluated the evidence for or against using a cuffed tube in newborn babies. \\nStudy characteristics: we collected and analyzed all relevant studies to answer the review question and found one study enrolling 76 babies, of whom 69 met eligibility for this review.

We included 87 studies with a total of 5964 participants in the analysis. \\nWhat does the evidence from the review tell us? \\nWe rated the overall quality of the evidence as 'moderate’ or 'low'.

There is no clear evidence that CBT is more effective than other treatments. A small number of studies looked at outcomes six months after CBT was given and showed that reductions in anxiety continued. We found no clear evidence that one way of providing CBT is more effective than another (e.g. in a group, longer treatments, with parents) or that CBT is more or less effective for any specific group of children (e.g. children with autism spectrum disorders). \\nWhat should happen next? \\nFuture research should compare CBT to alternative treatments and medication; identify who does and does not benefit from CBT and what those who do not benefit need; establish how to make CBT more accessible; and give far more consideration to neglected populations, including children and young people from low‐ and middle‐income countries. \\n\", '10.1002-14651858.CD011683.pub2-abstract.txt': \"Targeted mass media interventions to encourage healthier behaviours in adult, ethnic minorities \\nBackground and review question \\nHealth authorities and non‐governmental organisations often use mass media interventions (e.g. leaflets, radio and TV advertisements, posters and social media) to encourage healthier behaviours related to physical activity, dietary patterns, tobacco use or alcohol consumption, among others. In this review, we consider the effects of mass media interventions targeted towards ethnic minorities. A targeted intervention is designed for and considers the characteristics of a specific group, ideally providing ethnic minority groups equal opportunities and resources to access information, life skills, and opportunities to make healthier choices. However, we do not know whether targeted mass media strategies are more effective in reaching and influencing ethnic minorities than mass media strategies developed for the general population. \\nStudy characteristics \\nWe found six studies, all from the USA, four of which targeted African Americans and two which targeted Latino or Chinese immigrants. Of the studies, four were experimental (1693 volunteers) and two reported the results of large, targeted campaigns run in whole communities and cities. The evidence is current to August 2016. \\nKey results \\nThe available evidence is insufficient to conclude whether targeted mass media interventions for ethnic minority groups are more, less or equally effective in changing health behaviours than general mass media interventions. Only one study compared participants' smoking habits and intentions to quit following the receipt of either a culturally adapted smoking advice booklet or a booklet developed for the general population. They found little or no differences in smoking behaviours between the groups. \\nWhen compared to no mass media intervention, a targeted mass media intervention may increase the number of calls to smoking quit lines, but the effect on health behaviours is unclear. This conclusion is based on findings from three studies. One study gave participants access to a series of 12 live shows on cable TV with information on how to maintain a healthy weight through diet and physical activity. Compared to women who did not watch the shows, participants reported slightly increased physical activity and some positive changes to their dietary patterns; however, their body weight was no different over time. Two other studies were large‐scale targeted campaigns in which smokers were encouraged to call a quit line for smoking cessation advice. The number of telephone calls from the target population increased considerably during the campaign. \\nThis review also compared targeted mass media interventions versus mass media interventions with added personal interactions. These findings, based on three studies, were inconclusive. \\nNone of the studies reported whether the interventions could have had any adverse effects, such as possible stigmatisation or increased resistance to messages. \\nFurther studies directly comparing targeted mass media interventions with general mass media interventions would be useful. Few studies have investigated the effects of targeted mass media interventions for ethnic minority groups who primarily speak a non‐dominant language. \\nQuality of the evidence \\nOur confidence in the evidence of effect on all main outcomes is low to very low. This means that the true effect may be different or substantially different from the results presented in this review. We have moderate confidence in the estimated increase in the number of calls to smoking quit lines. \\n\", '10.1002-14651858.CD009030.pub2-abstract.txt': 'Splints and other non‐surgical methods for treating common injuries of the middle joints of the fingers \\nInjury to the ligaments of the middle joint (proximal interphalangeal joint) of a finger may occur as a result of the finger being forced backwards. This is known as a hyperextension injury. Characteristically, this occurs in sporting accidents, such as where a football strikes an outstretched hand. These injuries are common and typically affect people of working age. Usually, these patients are treated without surgery using a combination of support (splinting/strapping to the adjacent finger) and exercise advice. Use of the hand is commonly encouraged but restricted to some degree by the severity of the injury. By examining the evidence from randomised controlled trials, this review aimed to assess which treatment for hyperextension injuries of the proximal interphalangeal joints of the fingers results in the best outcome for patients. The outcomes examined included function (including return to work), pain and joint movement. \\nThree small studies including a total of 366 patients met the inclusion criteria for the review. The studies, which were all over 15 years old, were prone to bias. None of the studies reported any self assessment of function by participants. One study compared unrestricted mobility with immobilisation. One trial compared protected mobilisation (using a removable support in combination with exercise) with immobilisation. The remaining study compared immobilisation for one week versus three weeks. None of these trials found important differences between their intervention groups in various measures of poor outcome, pain and range of movement at six months follow‐up. \\nWe concluded that there was a lack of robust evidence to inform on the need for, and the extent and duration of, immobilisation for these injuries. \\n', '10.1002-14651858.CD013497.pub2-pls.txt': \"Growth factor‐supplemented culture media for women undergoing assisted reproduction\\nReview question \\nDoes culture media containing the growth factor GM‐CSF (granulocyte macrophage colony‐stimulating factor) improve the chances of a pregnancy and live‐born baby, and reduce the risk of miscarriage, twin or triplet pregnancy, premature birth, birth defects, genetic problems in the baby, and stillbirth? \\nBackground \\nAssisted reproduction includes processes whereby a woman's eggs and a man's sperm are combined to achieve fertilisation outside of the body. Embryos are placed in a solution called culture medium to support the growing embryo until it can be replaced into the woman's uterus. Culture medium supplemented with GM‐CSF is widely available in clinics and is often offered as an 'add‐on' to an in vitro fertilisation (IVF) cycle in an effort to improve the success rates of treatment. Using GM‐CSF‐supplemented culture medium can make IVF more expensive. \\nStudy characteristics \\nThe evidence is current to October 2019. We obtained data from three randomised controlled trials (a type of study in which participants are randomly assigned to one of two or more treatment groups) of 1532 infertile women undergoing IVF or intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI), a specialised form of IVF whereby the sperm is injected into the egg. We compared GM‐CSF‐supplemented culture media versus culture media not supplemented with GM‐CSF for those undergoing assisted reproduction. \\nWhat the review found \\nLow‐quality evidence reveals that we are uncertain whether GM‐CSF‐containing culture media makes any difference to the live‐birth rate when compared to using culture media not containing GM‐CSF. This suggests that if the rate of live birth associated with culture media not containing GM‐CSF is 22%, the rate with the use of GM‐CSF‐containing culture media would be between 21% and 30%. Low‐quality evidence also reveals that we are uncertain whether GM‐CSF‐containing culture media makes any difference to miscarriage when compared to using culture media not containing GM‐CSF. This suggests that if the miscarriage rate associated with culture media not containing GM‐CSF is 4%, the rate with the use of GM‐CSF‐containing culture media would be between 2% and 5%. Low‐quality evidence for pregnancy, birth defects, and genetic problems with the baby, and very low‐quality evidence for twin or triplet pregnancies, and premature birth, reveals that we are uncertain whether GM‐CSF‐containing culture media makes any difference to these outcomes when compared to culture media not containing GM‐CSF. Two studies looked at stillbirth, but as no stillbirths occurred in either study, we were unable to analyse this outcome. \\nOverall conclusions \\nDue to the very low to low quality of the evidence, we cannot be certain whether GM‐CSF is any more or less effective or harmful than culture media not supplemented with GM‐CSF. It is important that independent information on the available evidence is made accessible to those considering using GM‐CSF‐supplemented culture media. In the meantime, more large studies are needed to increase the certainty of our conclusions. \\n\", '10.1002-14651858.CD013836.pub2-pls.txt': \"Antibiotic regimens for late‐onset neonatal sepsis\\nReview question \\nWe reviewed the available evidence on different antibiotic regimens for newborns (from 72 hours of life to one month of life) with late‐onset sepsis. \\nBackground \\nSepsis in newborns is a severe and potential lethal condition, caused by the body's response to an infection. Neonatal sepsis is the third leading cause of neonatal death globally. Despite this high burden of sepsis in newborns, high‐quality evidence in diagnosis and treatment is scarce. This Cochrane Review was originally published in 2005. To identify the most appropriate antibiotic policies for neonatal sepsis, there is a need to base these policies on an updated well‐conducted review. Therefore, there is a need for such a review assessing the effects of different antibiotic regimens for late‐onset neonatal sepsis. \\nStudy characteristics \\nThe evidence is current to March 2021. We included five trials randomising 580 participants. The five trials compared five different antibiotic regimens. \\nKey results \\nWe included five trials:\\xa0one trial compared cefazolin plus amikacin with vancomycin plus amikacin; one trial compared ticarcillin plus clavulanic acid with flucloxacillin plus gentamicin; one trial compared cloxacillin plus amikacin with cefotaxime plus gentamicin; one trial compared meropenem with standard care (ampicillin plus gentamicin or cefotaxime plus gentamicin); and one trial compared vancomycin plus gentamicin with vancomycin plus aztreonam. \\nNone of the five antibiotic comparisons showed that the choice of antibiotics influenced the effects on death from all‐causes, serious adverse events (i.e. major complications), circulatory support, nephrotoxicity (toxicity in the kidneys), neurological developmental impairment (disabilities in the functioning of the brain that affect a child's behaviour, memory, or ability to learn), or necrotising enterocolitis (tissues in the gut become inflamed and start to die). Current evidence cannot confirm or reject, one antibiotic regimen being superior to another due to scarce data. \\nQuality of the evidence \\nOur conclusions are based on very low‐quality evidence. The five trials were at high risk of bias (i.e. the trials were conducted in a way that may have skewed results to the positive side). In addition, the five trials included few participants, making the results of this review imprecise. \\n\", '10.1002-14651858.CD013319.pub2-pls.txt': 'Transcatheter aortic valve implantation versus surgical aortic valve replacement in people with severe aortic stenosis and low surgical risk \\nReview question \\nDoes transcatheter approach, compared to open‐heart surgery, for aortic valve replacement improve outcomes in people with severe aortic stenosis and low surgical risk? \\nBackground \\nAortic stenosis (AS) is the narrowing of the exit of the left ventricle of the heart (where the aorta begins). It typically gets worse over time. Its severity can be divided into mild, moderate, severe, and very severe; and it is distinguishable by ultrasound scan of the heart and other clinical features. Once it has become severe, treatment primarily involves surgery to replace the valve. An alternative approach is to use transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI). This approach improves outcomes in individuals who are inoperable or at a high to intermediate risk for surgery. However, it remains unclear if TAVI is beneficial to those who have severe AS and are at a low surgical risk. \\nSearch Date \\nThe evidence is current to April 2019. We searched the literature and found a total of 3092 citations that were potentially relevant. After reviewing each of these, we found 13 published articles describing four clinical trials that could help us answer our question. \\nStudy characteristics \\nThe four clinical trials included 2818 participants who were randomly allocated to undergo either TAVI or surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR). The trials were multicentre and took place in Australia, Canada, France, Japan, the Netherlands, New Zealand, the USA, Denmark, and Sweden. \\nKey Results \\nModerate‐certainty evidence from clinical trials shows that, in the short term (i.e. during hospitalisation and up to 30 days of follow‐up), there is probably little or no difference between TAVI compared with SAVR in risk of death due to any cause, stroke (insult to the brain), myocardial infarction (injury or death of heart muscle), or death due to cardiac causes (e.g. myocardial infarction or failure of the heart muscle pump). Low‐certainty evidence shows that TAVI may reduce the risk of rehospitalisation compared with SAVR. We are uncertain whether TAVI, compared with SAVR, affects the length of hospital stay, although it appears to be associated with shorter duration of hospitalisation. High‐certainty evidence shows that fewer people had atrial fibrillation (a type of irregular heart rhythm), acute kidney injury (insult to the kidney), and bleeding when they underwent TAVI, compared with SAVR. However, moderate‐certainty evidence shows that TAVI probably increases the risk of permanent pacemaker implantation (a device that is placed to artificially set the heart rhythm), compared with SAVR. \\nQuality of the evidence \\nWe consider the overall quality of evidence to be moderate for most relevant outcomes (death, stroke, myocardial infarction, cardiac death, and risk of permanent pacemaker implantation), with the exception of rehospitalisation (low‐quality evidence) and length of hospital stay (very low quality evidence). The evidence for atrial fibrillation, acute kidney injury, and bleeding was of high quality. \\n', '10.1002-14651858.CD013518.pub2-pls.txt': 'Combination fixed‐dose beta agonist and steroid inhaler as required for adults or children with mild asthma \\nBackground \\nAsthma is the most common respiratory illness. Many people with asthma have mild asthma, but still remain at risk of severe asthma exacerbations, which often result in the use of oral steroids. Mild asthma is commonly treated with preventative inhalers, which contain a steroid used to reduce inflammation in the airways, and with reliever inhalers, which relax the muscles of the airways causing quick relief of asthma symptoms. Combination inhalers contain both the preventative steroid and the reliever, simplifying treatment and ensuring steroids are always given alongside the immediate relief of symptoms. \\nReview question \\nWe examined the findings of clinical trials to assess the use of combination inhalers in the treatment of mild asthma when taken on an as‐needed, symptom‐driven basis. \\nStudy characteristics \\nWe searched for studies up to March 2021. Results were collected from six studies which compared use of a combination inhaler used on an as‐needed basis with either as‐needed reliever‐only therapy or daily treatment with a low dose preventative inhaler. \\nKey findings \\nWe found that combination inhalers used as‐needed when compared with reliever‐only treatment reduced severe exacerbations requiring tablet steroids and rates of emergency admission to hospital with asthma symptoms. Differences in other measures relating to symptom control and lung function were too small to be clinically important. Rates of severe exacerbations were similar between patients on daily preventative steroid inhalers and those using combination inhalers as‐needed. People using combination inhalers had lower rates of hospital admission and lower total inhaled steroid dose, whilst the differences in lung function and asthma symptom control were not clinically significant. \\nThis review found the use of combination inhalers used when the patient experiences asthma symptoms was beneficial in reducing severe exacerbations when compared to stand‐alone reliever therapy in mild asthma. In addition to this the use of combination inhalers used on an as‐needed basis was associated with a reduction in hospital admissions and total inhaled steroid dose when compared with regularly‐taken low dose preventative inhaler therapy. \\nQuality of the evidence \\nThe studies which contributed data were well‐designed and robust, although two were open‐label (participants knew which treatment they were getting), with some potential for bias, so the evidence was generally of moderate‐to‐high quality. \\n', '10.1002-14651858.CD011899.pub2-abstract.txt': 'Computer‐based versus in‐person stress management programmes for workers\\nWhat is the aim of this review? \\nWe wanted to find out if stress management programmes at work had a different effect if they were given via a computer, compared to being given in person.

Many employers wish to reduce stress in their employees and are willing to invest in stress management programmes. It has been shown that workplace stress management programmes can reduce stress in employees, either when delivered by a computer or mobile device, or by a live person. However, it is unclear if the delivery method itself impacts how effective the programme is. Therefore, we evaluated the effect of the intervention delivery method (computer or in person) to reduce stress in workers. \\nWhat are the results of the review? \\nWe found two studies, involving 159 employees, that looked at stress levels in workers after completing stress management programmes on a computer, compared to workers receiving that same programme content from a live person.

It is one of the most common hospital‐acquired infections in children worldwide, and is associated with a high death rate.

The risks of CVCs are well‐known, and can cause infections, which may result in death or serious illnesses. Newborn infants are vulnerable, as they on the one hand require the CVCs to sustain life, and on the other hand are at high risks of the complications, due to their thin skin and poorly‐developed immune system. \\nSeveral measures have been developed to reduce infections in newborn infants. These include hand hygiene for caregivers, skin cleaning for the infants, antibiotics and modification of the catheters including the use of antiseptic or antibiotic‐coated catheter dressing or patch that could be placed on the skin at the CVC insertion site. While promising, these measures need on‐going evaluation. In this review, we synthesized up‐to‐date evidence on the effectiveness and safety of antiseptic or antibiotic dressing as a part of CVC care in sick newborn infants. \\nSearch date: We performed a search in multiple medical databases in September 2015. \\nStudy characteristics: Three studies (total participants: 855) fit our inclusion criteria. There were two main comparisons: i) chlorhexidine dressing and alcohol skin cleansing against standard polyurethane dressing and povidone‐iodine skin cleansing (from one large study), and ii) silver‐alginate patch against a control group without patch (from two smaller studies). The quality of the included studies are high, except that the people closely involved in the trials such as the care personnel were not masked from knowing whether or not the infants in the study were given antiseptic or antibiotic dressing, which might have affected their recording or interpretation of the results. \\nStudy funding sources: One of the studies was funded in part by Johnson and Johnson Medical; Children\\'s Foundation; Children\\'s Hospital, Milwaukee and National Institutes of Health. Another study was funded by the Vanderbilt NICU Research Fund. Funding source was not stated in the third study. \\nKey results: In our main findings, chlorhexidine dressing/alcohol skin cleansing made no difference to catheter‐related blood stream infection (CRBSI) and blood stream infection (\"sepsis\") without an identifiable source, although it significantly reduced the chance of micro‐organisms lodging in the CVCs (\"catheter colonisation\"), with an average of 9% reduction in risk among newborn infants with a baseline risk of 24% (1 study, 655 infants). However, infants who received chlorhexidine dressing/alcohol skin cleansing were more likely to develop skin irritation (\"contact dermatitis\"), as 19 out of 335 infants (5.7%) in the chlorhexidine group developed this complication compared to none in the group that received standard dressing/povidone‐iodine cleansing. However, it was unclear whether the dressing or the alcohol solution was mainly responsible for the skin irritation, as the other group did not use alcohol solution for skin cleansing. In the other comparison, silver‐alginate patch made no overall differences in CRBSI and mortality compared to no dressing, neither did it cause any adverse reaction. \\nQuality of the evidence: There was moderate‐quality evidence for all the major outcomes. The major factor that affected the quality of evidence was the lack of precision in the result estimates, as the calculated plausible range of the effects (the 95% confidence intervals) were wide. \\nConclusions: Chlorhexidine CVC dressing with alcohol skin cleansing posed a high risk of skin irritation against a modest reduction in catheter colonisation. For silver‐alginate patch, evidence is still insufficient for a clear picture of benefit an harm.

These programmes may be based at hospitals, outpatient clinics, or even at home.\\xa0 \\nPulmonary rehabilitation is a recommended standard of care for many chronic lung conditions; however, its effects in adults with asthma are less clear. \\nWhat did we want to find out? \\nWe wanted to see how pulmonary rehabilitation affects physical fitness, control of asthma symptoms, and wellbeing of adults with asthma compared to usual clinical care involving no pulmonary rehabilitation. We also wanted to learn how it affects the rate of severe asthma attacks/hospitalisations, mental health (anxiety and depression), muscle strength, physical activity levels, and markers of inflammation (in sputum or blood). Finally, we wanted to see whether it is associated with any unwanted effects.\\xa0 \\nWhat did we do? \\nWe searched for studies that compared pulmonary rehabilitation to usual care in adults with asthma. Treatment must have lasted at least four weeks (or eight or more sessions) and must have included aerobic exercises (such as walking or cycling) and education or self‐management.\\xa0 \\nWe compared and summarised findings across all eligible studies and rated our confidence in the evidence based on factors such as study methods and size. \\nWhat did we find? \\n‐ We found 10 studies involving 894 adults with asthma.\\xa0\\n‐ The studies ranged in size from 24 to 412 people.\\xa0\\n‐ Most studies were conducted in Europe.\\xa0\\n‐ Where reported, most study participants were female, with the average age ranging from 27 to 54 years.\\xa0 \\n‐ One study specifically included people with severe forms of asthma. Another study specifically included people who had a condition involving overlapping features of both asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). \\n‐ The way pulmonary rehabilitation was delivered varied across studies. Inpatient programmes lasted 3 to 4 weeks, whilst outpatient programmes lasted 8 to 12 weeks. \\n‐ The specific nature of exercise or education components amongst the included studies varied widely. \\nMain results \\n‐ Pulmonary rehabilitation probably causes a large increase in physical fitness immediately after completion of the programme, resulting in an ability to walk an average of 80 metres further in 6 minutes than in people who receive usual care. There may be little to no effect on physical fitness measured up to one year later. \\n‐ Pulmonary rehabilitation may result in small improvements in or little to no impact on asthma control immediately after completion of the programme or up to one year later compared to usual care.\\xa0 \\n‐ Pulmonary rehabilitation probably causes a large improvement in wellbeing as measured by the St George’s Respiratory Disease Questionnaire immediately after completion of the programme. Results may differ slightly according to different quality of life instruments. The effects potentially last up to one year, but results are very uncertain. \\n‐ Little to no effect on wellbeing was observed after programme completion or up to nine months follow‐up when the Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire was used.\\xa0 \\n‐ There was very limited evidence to determine the effect of pulmonary rehabilitation on rates of asthma attacks/hospitalisations, measures of anxiety and depression, limb muscle strength, levels of physical activity, or markers of inflammation in the blood or sputum.\\xa0 \\n‐ Data from one study suggested pulmonary rehabilitation resulted in no direct unwanted or harmful effects. \\nLimitations of the evidence\\xa0 \\nOur confidence in the evidence relating to outcomes such as physical fitness, wellbeing, and asthma control is limited due to concerns regarding unclear methods in some studies, the potential for participants or assessors (or both) to have influenced outcomes due to the awareness of assigned treatments, and the varied ways in which pulmonary rehabilitation was delivered. \\nThe evidence is up‐to‐date to May 2021.\\n', '10.1002-14651858.CD011357.pub2-abstract.txt': \"Antibiotics for bacterial infection in the urine in kidney transplant recipients when there are no symptoms \\nWhat is the issue? Bacteria in the urine in kidney transplant recipients when there are no symptoms of urine infection is called asymptomatic bacteriuria. Up to one in two people with a kidney transplant will develop a bacterial infection of the urine (bacteriuria) at some point after transplantation. Bacteriuria with symptoms like fever, chills, painful urination, abdominal pain and blood in urine is a urinary tract infection (UTI). Bacteriuria often occurs without symptoms and it is frequently treated with antibiotics with the idea this might help avoid subsequent UTI. Avoiding UTI might improve patient and transplant survival. However, it is unclear how many people with asymptomatic bacteriuria go on to develop UTI symptoms; whether treatment with antibiotics truly avoids UTI; or whether treatment when asymptomatic improves survival of both patient and kidney. Also, there can be downsides to taking antibiotics. Taking regular antibiotics might mean that bacteria resistant to antibiotics are encouraged, and taking antibiotics might cause diarrhoea and other adverse events. There are also antibiotic costs to consider. This review looked at whether treating with antibiotics is beneficial of harmful. \\nWhat did we do? \\nWe searched the literature up to September 2017 and identified two studies (212 participants) that were evaluated in this review. These studies compared antibiotics versus no treatment. \\nWhat did we find? The bacterial infection of the urine often persisted, whether antibiotics were given or not. It was uncertain whether antibiotics prevented symptomatic urinary infection or increased the risk of selecting bacteria resistant to antibiotics, because there were too few data and several limitations in the included studies. Also, it was unclear whether the use of antibiotics in case of urinary infection without symptoms reduced the risks of graft rejection, need for hospitalisation due to symptoms of urinary infection, or mortality, or whether antibiotics improved the function of the kidney transplant. One study with 112 participants suggested there were no severe harmful reactions caused by the antibiotic treatment, and non‐severe adverse events appeared to be rare. \\nConclusions It is uncertain whether antibiotics are beneficial in kidney transplant recipients with bacteria in their urine but no symptoms. In one study, participants were assigned to antibiotics or no therapy by a method that was not random (i.e. according to patients' transplant code). In both studies, participants knew which treatment they were receiving (i.e. antibiotics or no therapy), which may have influenced the results. Last, we had not enough data to estimate with precision some effects of antibiotics.

More studies are needed to identify the best ways to support people who are trying to stop smoking, and to identify the best people to support them. \\nStopping smoking \\nThe best thing people who smoke can do for their health is to stop smoking.\\nMost people who smoke want to stop, but many find it difficult. People who smoke may use medicines to help them stop. Behavioural support provides an alternative – or additional – way to help people stop smoking. Sometimes behavioural support can be combined with nicotine replacement or other medicines to help people stop smoking. \\nTypes of behavioural support can include: advice and counselling on ways to make it easier to stop smoking; information about why or how to stop; or a combination. Behavioural support can be given in group sessions or one‐to‐one. \\nWhy we did this Cochrane Review \\nWe wanted to find out:\\n– which types of behavioural support work best to help people stop smoking;\\n– the best ways to give behavioural support (including the best people to give it); and \\n– what aspects of behavioural support help someone to stop smoking.\\nWe also wanted to know if behavioural support can cause any unwanted effects.\\nWhat did we do? \\nWe searched for Cochrane Reviews of behavioural support to stop smoking, to identify relevant studies of adults who smoked. We then compared the studies with each other, to find out how well the different types of behavioural support helped people to stop smoking. \\nSearch date: we included evidence published up to July 2020. \\nWhat we found \\nWe found 33 Cochrane Reviews, from which we identified 312 relevant studies in 250,503 adults (aged 18 to 63 years) who smoked cigarettes. The studies investigated 437 different combinations of ways to stop smoking. \\nMost studies were conducted in the USA or Western Europe; 115 studies took place in healthcare settings and 195 took place in the community. On average, people taking part in the studies were followed up for 10.5 months. \\nThe studies compared the effects of behavioural support with:\\n– no behavioural support;\\n– usual or standard care;\\n– less‐intense forms of the behavioural support; or other approaches.\\nWe compared all treatments with each other using a mathematical method called network meta‐analysis. \\nWhat are the main results of our review? \\nCompared with no behavioural support it was clear that some types of behavioural support increased people's chances of quitting for six months or longer, including: counselling and giving them money for successfully stopping smoking. More people stopped smoking with these types of support whether or not they were also taking medicines to help them stop smoking. \\nBehavioural support by text messages probably helped more people to stop smoking than no support. \\nCompared with no support, tailoring behavioural support to the person, or group of people, trying to stop smoking probably slightly increased how many of them stopped smoking, as did support that focused on how to stop smoking. \\nIncreasing the intensity of the support given, such as contacting people more often or having longer sessions, modestly increased how many people stopped smoking. \\nWe are uncertain about:\\n– the effects of other types of behavioural support, including hypnotherapy, exercise‐based support, and entering competitions; and \\n– the effect of who gives the behavioural support.\\nOnly some studies reported results for unwanted effects; in these, behavioural support did not increase the numbers of any unwanted effects. \\nHow confident are we in our results? \\nWe are confident that counselling and rewards of money help people to stop smoking; we do not expect that more evidence will change these results. \\nWe are less confident in our results for other types of behavioural support, and about who gives the support and how. We found limitations with some of the studies, including how they were designed, conducted, and reported. These results are likely to change when more evidence becomes available.

Symptoms of mild or moderate hypoglycaemia are for example, shakiness, dizziness, sweating or nervousness, First aid for this condition is usually self‐administered but is often provided by family or friends, and glucose tablets compared with dietary forms of sugar such as juice, candies or dried fruit strips have shown to result in a better resolution of symptoms. Glucose can be given orally (swallowed), but also inside the cheek against the buccal mucosa (‘buccal administration’), under the tongue (‘sublingual administration’) or via the rectal route. In the latter three ways of treatment, the glucose is not being swallowed as with the oral route. \\nStudy characteristics \\nWe identified four studies. One randomised study (clinical trials where people are randomly allocated to one of two or more treatment groups) compared sublingual glucose administration, in the form of table sugar, with an oral administration in 42 hypoglycaemic children between one and 15 years old. Two non‐randomised studies compared buccal glucose administration with oral administration in 23 adult healthy fasting volunteers. One randomised study compared a dextrose gel with oral administration of glucose in 18 people with type 1 diabetes and hypoglycaemia. \\nKey results \\nProviding sugar under the tongue (sublingual) resulted in a greater rise in blood glucose after 20 minutes than giving the sugar orally, but this was in a specific setting including children with hypoglycaemia and symptoms of concomitant malaria or respiratory tract infection. On the other hand, giving glucose by the buccal mucosa route resulted in a lower plasma glucose concentration than with the oral route. For dextrose gel (where uptake of the glucose occurs through a combination of oral swallowing and via the buccal mucosa), no clear benefit was shown compared to oral glucose administration (glucose tablets or glucose solutions). Most studies did not report on time to resolution of symptoms, resolution of hypoglycaemia as defined by blood glucose levels above a certain threshold, time to resolution of hypoglycaemia, adverse events, and treatment delay. \\nCertainty of the evidence \\nThe evidence is of very low certainty due to limitations in study design, few studies and small number of participants in the studies, and because half of the studies were performed with healthy volunteers rather than in people with characteristic hypoglycaemia. \\n', '10.1002-14651858.CD013359.pub2-pls.txt': 'Xpert tests for active tuberculosis in children\\nWhy is improving the diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis important? \\nIn 2018, at least one million children became ill with tuberculosis and around 200,000 died. When detected early and effectively treated, tuberculosis is largely curable. Xpert MTB/RIF and Xpert Ultra are World Health Organization‐recommended tests that simultaneously detect tuberculosis and rifampicin resistance in adults and children with tuberculosis symptoms. Rifampicin is an important anti‐tuberculosis drug. Not recognizing tuberculosis early may result in delayed diagnosis and treatment, severe illness, and death. A false tuberculosis diagnosis may result in anxiety and unnecessary treatment. \\nWhat is the aim of this review? \\nTo determine the accuracy of tests in symptomatic children for diagnosing pulmonary tuberculosis, tuberculous meningitis, lymph node tuberculosis, and rifampicin resistance. \\nWhat was studied in this review? \\nXpert MTB/RIF and Xpert Ultra, with results measured against culture and a composite reference standard (benchmarks), recognizing that neither reference is perfect in children. \\nWhat are the main results in this review? \\nA total of 49 studies were included. For pulmonary tuberculosis, we analysed 299 data sets including information describing nearly 70,000 children. \\nFor a population of 1000 children:\\nXpert MTB/RIF \\n‐ where 100 have pulmonary tuberculosis in sputum (by culture), 74 would be Xpert MTB/RIF‐positive, of whom 9 (12%) would not have tuberculosis (false‐positives); 926 would be Xpert MTB/RIF‐negative; and 35 (4%) would have tuberculosis (false‐negatives) \\n‐ where 100 have tuberculous meningitis (by culture), 86 would be Xpert MTB/RIF‐positive, of whom 59 (69%) would not have tuberculosis (false‐positives); 914 would be Xpert MTB/RIF‐negative; and 23 (3%) would have tuberculosis (false‐negatives) \\n‐ where 100 people have lymph node tuberculosis (by culture), 142 would be Xpert MTB/RIF‐positive, of whom 97 (68%) would not have lymph node tuberculosis (false‐positives); 858 would be Xpert MTB/RIF‐negative; and 5 (1%) would have lymph node TB (false‐negatives) \\n‐ where 100 have rifampicin resistance, 108 would have Xpert MTB/RIF‐rifampicin resistance detected, of whom 18 (17%) would not have rifampicin resistance (false‐positives); 892 would have Xpert MTB/RIF‐rifampicin resistance NOT detected; and 10 (1%) would have rifampicin resistance (false‐negatives) \\nXpert Ultra \\n‐ where 100 have pulmonary tuberculosis in sputum (by culture), 100 would be Xpert Ultra‐positive, of whom 27 (27%) would not have tuberculosis (false‐positives); 900 would be Xpert Ultra‐negative; and 27 (3%) would have tuberculosis (false‐negatives) \\nHow confident are we in the results of this review? \\nWe are confident. We included many studies from different countries and settings and used two reference standards. Some studies included only children at referral centres or did not report the setting. Therefore, we could not assess how the tests would work in a primary care setting. \\nWhat children do the results of this review apply to? \\nChildren with presumed pulmonary tuberculosis, tuberculous meningitis, lymph node tuberculosis, or rifampicin resistance. \\nWhat are the implications of this review? \\nThe results of the review suggest Xpert tests have the potential to be used to detect tuberculosis and rifampicin resistance. \\n‐ The risk of missing a diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis confirmed by culture with Xpert MTB/RIF (in sputum) is low (4% of those whose Xpert MTB/RIF suggests they do not have tuberculosis) suggesting that only a small number of children with tuberculosis confirmed by culture will not receive treatment. The risk of wrongly diagnosing a child as having tuberculosis is slightly higher (12% of those whose Xpert MTB/RIF test suggests they do have tuberculosis). This may result in some of these children receiving unnecessary treatment. \\n‐ The risk of missing a diagnosis of rifampicin resistance with Xpert MTB/RIF is low (1% of those whose Xpert MTB/RIF suggests they do not have rifampicin resistance) suggesting that only a small number of children with tuberculosis will not receive the appropriate treatment. The risk of wrongly diagnosing a child as rifampicin resistance tuberculosis is higher (17% of those whose Xpert MTB/RIF test suggests they do have rifampicin resistance).

It is commonly used in late pregnancy to address maternal and fetal problems. Induction of labour using pharmacological and mechanical methods can cause complications or side‐effects such as bleeding, caesarean section uterine hyperstimulation and maternal and newborn infections. A complementary and alternative medicine method, such as hypnosis, may provide a safe alternative method for inducing labour. \\nHypnosis is a relaxation technique in which the person closes down their awareness of external distractions to concentrate on a specific image, thoughts or feelings. Hypnosis has long been used to reduce pain perception during labour and hypnotic relaxation may be beneficial for women who are extremely anxious about giving birth. Hypnosis may increase self‐confidence and well‐being and be associated with decreased costs to the healthcare system if effective. The effectiveness of hypnosis for induction of labour has not however been evaluated. We searched for randomised controlled trials that examined the effect of hypnosis for induction of labour. We did not find any studies for inclusion in this review. Trials using hypnosis are required so that the effectiveness and safety of hypnotic relaxation to induce labour in pregnant women with high levels of anxiety can be fully evaluated. The length and timing of the intervention, as well as the staff training required, and the views and experiences of women and staff, should be taken into consideration. As hypnosis may delay standard care (in case standard care is withheld during hypnosis), its use in induction of labour should be considered on a case‐by‐case basis. \\n', '10.1002-14651858.CD006487.pub2-abstract.txt': \"Injectable local anaesthetic agents for preventing pain in participants requiring dental treatment \\nReview question \\nThis review assessed the evidence for providing successful local anaesthesia that prevents pain during a dental procedure. Included studies compared injections of local anaesthetic to help people requiring dental treatment and to prevent painful sensations tested in an experimental way (such as using cold, a sharp probe, or an electric stimulus). \\nBackground \\nAn injection of local anaesthetic prevents a person from feeling pain. It is given in one specific area rather than in the whole body. Although pain during dental treatment can be successfully managed, it is a common fear of patients. \\nSeveral different local anaesthetics are available to dentists, as well as a variety of ways to deliver them, to prevent pain. Factors that appear to influence success include increased difficulty in anaesthetizing teeth in the presence of inflammation, variable susceptibility of different teeth to local anaesthesia, different operative procedures performed on the tooth (for example, it appears easier to achieve successful anaesthesia for dental extractions than for root canal treatment), and various techniques and solutions used to give the local anaesthetic. \\nWe investigated whether injection of one local anaesthetic solution was more effective than another for preventing pain during dental treatment or during an experimental study, and whether this effect occurred quickly or lasted a sufficient length of time, if any unwanted effects occurred, and people’s experience of the dental procedures. Local adverse events might include pain during or after injection, or long‐lasting anaesthesia. Systemic effects due to the local anaesthetic solution can include allergic reactions and changes in heart rate and blood pressure. \\nStudy characteristics \\nTwo reviewers searched the literature to identify studies that compared different local anaesthetic solutions injected into people undergoing dental treatment or volunteers who had the same outcomes measured in experimental ways. Within every trial, each person was randomly assigned to receive one of the local anaesthetics under study. The search was up‐to‐date as of 31 January 2018. \\nWe found 123 trials with 19,223 male and female participants. These trials investigated pain experienced during dental treatment including surgery, extraction, periodontal (gum) treatment, tooth preparation, root canal treatment, anaesthesia of nerves within teeth (pulps) tested using an electric pulp tester or cold stimulant, and anaesthesia of soft tissues measured following pricking of gums or self‐reported by the participant. We pooled data from 68 studies (6615 participants). This resulted in eight outcomes when seven different local anaesthetic solutions were tested during dental treatment, two outcomes assessing pain during and after injection of local anaesthetic, and 47 outcomes tested with a pulp tester or by pricking of gums or self‐reported by participants. \\nKey results \\nThe review suggests that of the 14 types of local anaesthetic tested, evidence to support the use of one over another is limited to the outcome of success (absence of pain), from three comparisons of local anaesthetic. Findings show that 4% articaine, 1:100,000 epinephrine was superior to 2% lidocaine, 1:100,000 epinephrine in posterior teeth with inflamed pulps requiring root canal treatment. No difference between these solutions was seen when pain on injection was assessed, and although lidocaine resulted in less post‐injection pain, the difference was minimal. Researchers found that 2% lidocaine, 1:100,000 epinephrine was superior to 3% prilocaine, 0.03 IU felypressin and 4% prilocaine plain for surgical procedures and surgical procedures/periodontal treatment, respectively. Speeds of onset were within clinically acceptable times, and durations were variable, making them suitable for different applications. Both of these latter outcomes were tested in experimental ways that may not reflect clinical findings. Unwanted effects were rare. Patients' experience of the procedures was not assessed owing to lack of data. \\nQuality of the evidence \\nFrom comparisons of local anaesthetics in this review, all appeared effective and safe with little difference between them. Available evidence ranged from moderate to very low in quality. Some studies fell short, in terms of quality, owing to small numbers of participants, unclear reporting of study methods, and reporting of data in a format that was not easy to combine with other data.

It is thought that the selection of high‐quality sperm may improve outcomes for these couples. Advanced sperm selection techniques use complex methods to select healthy, mature, and structurally sound sperm for fertilisation. Despite the use of these techniques in many centres worldwide, their effectiveness is unclear. \\nStudy characteristics \\nWe included eight randomised controlled trials (a type of study in which participants are assigned to one of two or more treatment groups using a random method) with a total of 4147 women. Four studies evaluated sperm selection by their ability to bind to hyaluronic acid during the ICSI process (HA‐ICSI) against ICSI. One study compared HA‐ICSI versus SpermSlow. One study compared HA‐ICSI versus magnetic‐activated cell sorting (MACS) versus ICSI. Three studies compared MACS versus ICSI. One study compared sperm selection by surface charge Zeta potential versus ICSI. Six of the included studies reported rates of live birth; seven reported clinical pregnancy; six reported miscarriage per clinical pregnancy and per woman randomly assigned; and none reported on foetal abnormalities. \\nKey results \\nThe current evidence suggests that advanced sperm selection strategies in assisted reproductive technologist (ART) may not result in an increase in the likelihood of live birth. The only sperm selection technique that potentially increases live birth and clinical pregnancy rates is Zeta sperm selection, yet these results were of very low quality and derived from a single study, therefore we are uncertain of the effect. There is low‐quality evidence that HA‐ICSI decreases miscarriage rates when compared with ICSI. We are uncertain whether the other sperm selection techniques alter clinical pregnancy or miscarriage rates. No studies reported on foetal abnormalities, and further studies of suitable quality are required before any of these advanced sperm selection techniques can be recommended for use in clinical practice. \\nEvidence quality \\nThe evidence gathered was of very low to low quality. The main limitations were imprecision associated with low numbers of participants or events and high risk of performance bias.

These include controlling people's movements and contacts, using personal protective equipment (PPE), or regular testing for infection. \\nSARS‐CoV‐2 is very infectious. Elderly or disabled people, who live in care homes (long‐term care facilities), are vulnerable to infection because they live in close contact with other people, with carers and visitors entering and leaving the facility. Due to age and underlying health conditions, care home residents have an increased risk of becoming seriously ill with COVID‐19 and dying from the disease. \\nWhat did we want to find out? \\nWe wanted to find out how effective non‐medicinal measures are in preventing residents and staff in long‐term care facilities from becoming infected with SARS‐CoV‐2 and in reducing the spread of the infection. We focused on all types of long‐term care facilities for adults, such as nursing homes for the elderly and skilled nursing facilities for people living with disabilities. \\nWhat did we do? \\nWe searched for studies that investigated the effects of non‐medicinal measures in long‐term care facilities. To be included, studies had to report how many infections, hospitalisations or deaths the measures prevented in residents or staff, or whether the measures prevented the introduction of the virus into the facilities or prevented outbreaks within facilities. We included any type of study, including observational studies that used ‘real‐world’ data, or modelling studies based on assumed data from computer‐generated simulations. \\nWhat did we find? \\nWe found 22 studies, 11 observational and 11 modelling studies. All studies were conducted in North America or Europe. \\nThere were four main types of measures.\\n1.Entry regulation measures to prevent residents, staff or visitors introducing the virus into the facility. Measures included staff confining themselves with residents, quarantine for newly‐admitted residents, testing new admissions, not allowing the admission of new residents, and preventing visitors from entering facilities. \\n2. Contact‐regulating and transmission‐reducing measures to prevent people passing on the virus. Measures included wearing masks or PPE, social distancing, extra cleaning, reducing contact between residents and among staff, and placing residents and staff in care groups and limiting contact between groups. \\n3. Surveillance measures designed to identify an outbreak early. Measures included regular testing of residents or staff regardless of symptoms, and symptom‐based testing. \\n4. Outbreak control measures to reduce the consequences of an outbreak. Measures included isolation of infected residents, and separating infected and non‐infected residents or staff caring for them. \\nSome studies used a combination of these measures.\\nMain results \\nEntry regulation measures  (4 observational studies; 4 modelling studies) \\nMost studies showed that such measures were beneficial, but some studies found no effects or unwanted effects, such as depression and delirium among residents in the context of visiting restrictions. \\nContact‐regulating and transmission‐reducing measures  (6 observational studies; 2 modelling studies) \\nSome measures may be beneficial, but often the evidence is very uncertain.\\nSurveillance measures  (2 observational studies; 6 modelling studies) \\nRoutine testing of residents and staff may reduce the number of infections, hospitalisations and deaths among residents, although the evidence on the number of deaths among staff was less clear. Testing more often, getting test results faster, and using more accurate tests were predicted to have more beneficial effects. \\nOutbreak control measures  (4 observational studies; 3 modelling studies) \\nThese measures may reduce the number of infections and the risk of outbreaks in facilities, but often the evidence is very uncertain. \\nCombination measures  (2 observational studies; 1 modelling study) \\nA combination of different measures may be effective in reducing the number of infections and deaths. \\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence? \\nOur confidence in these results is limited. Many studies used mathematical prediction rather than real‐world data, and we cannot be confident that the model assumptions are accurate. Most observational studies did not use the most reliable methods.

Symptoms include shortness of breath, and cough with sputum production due to airways and lung damage. People with COPD may have one or more other long‐term conditions (comorbidities) such as heart disease, hypertension, diabetes, asthma and lung cancer which can lead to poor health. People living with two or more comorbidities can also be known as living with multimorbidity. \\nWhy did we do this review?\\xa0 \\nBecause many people with COPD live with multimorbidity, naturally people in clinical trials will have multimorbidities. However, the results of those trials are usually not reported broken down by multimorbidity.

After some deliberation, we decided to include the following two sorts of trials. \\n1. Any single intervention for COPD delivered to people with COPD adapted to or targeting their comorbidity compared to routine care or any other intervention. \\n2. Any intervention aimed at changing the management of people with COPD and comorbidities, which could be simple (e.g. scheduling COPD and heart clinics on the same day) or more complex (e.g. developing a new care package for management of people with COPD across a local health service), compared to routine care. \\nWe wanted to know which treatments improve quality of life and reduce exacerbations for people living with COPD and one or more comorbidities. \\nWe also wanted to find out about how people with COPD, carers and health professionals felt about those treatments. \\nWhat information did we find? \\nWe carried out a search for studies in January 2021. We found seven \\xa0eligible randomised controlled trials (RCTs) including 1197 people, and one qualitative study which was part of one of the randomised trials and provided information about people's opinions and experiences of using telehealth equipment. People included in the trials were aged between 64 and 72 years, and their COPD severity ranged from mild to very severe. The trials either included people with COPD and a specific comorbidity such as cardiovascular disease or lung cancer, or they included people with COPD and one or more other conditions of any sort. \\nResults and conclusions \\nThere is not enough evidence on people with COPD and other comorbidities to draw firm conclusions about interventions aimed at COPD that are adapted for the comorbidity. The available evidence indicated the following:\\xa0 \\n‐ Quality of life as measured by the St George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) total score may improve with tailored pulmonary rehabilitation compared to usual care (note that there is a strong evidence base for pulmonary rehabilitation in people with COPD). \\n‐ Pulmonary rehabilitation is likely to improve quality of life as measured by the COPD assessment test (CAT) scores compared with usual care at 52 weeks and with a multicomponent telehealth intervention.\\xa0 \\n‐ Evidence is uncertain about the effects of pharmacotherapy optimisation or telemonitoring interventions on CAT improvement compared with usual care. \\n‐ There may be little to no difference in the number of people experiencing exacerbations, or mean exacerbations with case management compared with usual care.\\xa0 \\n‐ For secondary outcomes, the distance walked by participants in six minutes may improve with pulmonary rehabilitation, water‐based exercise or multicomponent interventions. A multicomponent intervention may result in fewer people being admitted to hospital, although there may be little to no difference in a telemonitoring intervention.\\xa0 \\n‐ There may be little to no difference between intervention and usual care for deaths across several studies. \\n‐ One study compared water‐based exercise with land‐based exercise. We found no evidence for quality of life or exacerbations. There may be little to no difference between water‐ and land‐based exercise on the distance walked by participants in six minutes. \\n‐ One qualitative study explored perceptions and experiences of people with COPD and long‐term conditions, and of researchers and health professionals who were involved in an RCT of telemonitoring equipment. Several themes were identified, including health status, beliefs and concerns, reliability of equipment, self‐efficacy, perceived ease of use, factors affecting usefulness and perceived usefulness, attitudes and intention, self‐management and changes in healthcare use.\\xa0 \\nLarger studies with more people with COPD and comorbidities could help to find out if targeted approaches can improve health. \\nCertainty of the information \\nOverall there were very few studies and most studies were small. This means the results are based on a small amount of information. Trials with different interventions and different or more people may give a different result. \\n\", '10.1002-14651858.CD013259.pub2-pls.txt': \"Preparing a patient with bowel cancer for surgery with multiple interventions\\nAim of this review \\nThe aim of this review is to find out whether multiple interventions introduced in the period prior to surgery for bowel cancer could prepare a patient by increasing the patient's overall fitness, and thus improve outcomes after surgery. Cochrane researchers collected and analysed all available randomised controlled trials on this topic. \\nKey messages \\nOnly three studies met the inclusion criteria for this review, information was not available for all outcomes and the overall certainty of evidence was very low to moderate. More and larger studies are needed to gather evidence on this topic. \\nWhat was studied in the review? \\nSurgery is often given to cure patients diagnosed with early stage bowel cancer. Surgery has a negative impact on the overall fitness of the patient. The energy level decreases, patients are more dependent in their daily living activities, and quality of life decreases. Furthermore, complications may occur after surgery causing a further decrease of fitness. Preoperative interventions, such as exercise programmes, nutritional advice and supplements, as well as mental support, may increase the fitness of the patient, prior to surgery. This concept is called prehabilitation. The impact of surgery is diminished and consequently results in faster and better recovery. Combining such preoperative interventions results in better preparation for surgery because each interventions may help to strengthen the effects of the others. The review authors aimed to study the effect of such multiple‐intervention preparation programmes before surgery for patients with bowel cancer. The review authors focused on these outcomes: physical fitness, number of complications after surgery, death rate, quality of life (assessed with questionnaires), length of stay in the hospital, number of emergency department visits, number of re‐admissions after surgery, safety of the programme and adherence to the programme. They compared groups with prehabilitation programmes to groups not receiving any preparation prior to surgery, other than standard care. \\nMain results of this review \\nThe review authors found three studies with 250 participants with bowel cancer, without metastases, scheduled for surgery. Studies were conducted in Canada. A total of 130 participants followed four‐week prehabilitation programmes prior to surgery, which included exercises, nutritional advice and supplements, as well as techniques to reduce anxiety about their cancer and its treatment. Another 120 participants followed identical programmes, but only started them after the surgery, when they were discharged from hospital. \\nOverall, the review authors did not find an improvement in either group of participants. The certainty of evidence was very low to moderate, mainly because of the small numbers of studies and participants included in the review. Physical fitness potentially improves and the number of complications and emergency department visits may diminish in patients receiving prehabilitation programmes prior to surgery. On the other hand, more re‐admissions to the hospital occurred after prehabilitation programmes. Because data on death rates, quality of life, length of stay in the hospital, safety of\\xa0the programme and adherence to the programme was not complete or not reported, the review authors did not analyse these outcomes. Due to the mostly low or very low certainty of the evidence, the findings of this review should be interpreted with caution. \\nHow up‐to‐date is this review? \\nThe review authors searched for studies that had been published up to January 2021 and also looked for unpublished, ongoing studies up to March 2021. In a future update of this review, many ongoing studies will likely have been completed, which can be included to collect more evidence on this subject. \\n\", '10.1002-14651858.CD011979.pub2-abstract.txt': \"Phototherapy for treating foot ulcers in people with diabetes\\nReview question \\nPhototherapy is a pain‐free method of treatment that uses light to treat various medical conditions. We reviewed the evidence about phototherapy for foot ulcers in people with diabetes. We wanted to find out whether phototherapy speeds up wound healing and improves patients' quality of life, and whether there are any side effects. \\nBackground \\nFoot ulcers are a disabling complication of diabetes that affect 15% to 25% of people with diabetes at some time in their lives. Diabetic foot ulcers are painful and prone to infection. Not all diabetic foot ulcers can be healed, which can ultimately lead to surgical removal of a limb. Phototherapy involves exposing the affected area to ultraviolet light, sometimes using lasers. This is thought to help ulcers heal through multiple mechanisms such as increased cell growth and blood vessel activity. It has been used as an alternative approach for healing foot ulcers in people with diabetes. \\nStudy characteristics \\nWe searched for randomised controlled trials comparing different phototherapies, or comparing phototherapy with other treatments or a placebo (sham treatment), for foot ulcers in adults with diabetes in October 2016. We included eight trials (316 participants). Most studies were undertaken in clinics or hospitals and had small numbers of participants (14 to 84). The average age in the included studies was from 53 to 68 years, and the ratio of females to males was 0.46 to 1.88. The included studies compared phototherapy with placebo or no phototherapy, on top of usual care (usual care could include treatments such as dressings, antibiotics, or wound cleaning). Treatment times ranged from 15 days to 20 weeks. \\nKey results \\nThe results suggested that phototherapy, when compared to no phototherapy or a placebo, may increase the proportion of wounds completely healed during follow‐up and reduce wound size. However, as the included studies involved small numbers of participants and had drawbacks in study methods, our confidence in these results is limited. We did not find sufficient evidence that the potential harms or incidence of amputations differed between the phototherapy group and the no phototherapy/placebo group. \\nQuality of the evidence \\nWe judged the quality of the evidence to be low due to a lack of data and risk of the study results being biased. Further high‐quality studies are needed to confirm the benefits and harms of phototherapy. \\nThis plain language summary is up to date as of 26 October 2016.\\n\", '10.1002-14651858.CD003552.pub4-abstract.txt': 'Skin patch or vaginal ring compared to pills for birth control\\nThe skin patch and the vaginal (birth canal) ring are two methods of birth control. Both methods contain the hormones estrogen and progestin. The patch is a small, thin, adhesive square that is applied to the skin. The contraceptive vaginal ring is a flexible, lightweight device that is inserted into the vagina. Both methods release drugs like those in birth control pills. These methods could be used more consistently than pills because they do not require a daily dose. This review looked at how well the methods worked to prevent pregnancy, if they caused bleeding problems, if women used them as prescribed, and how safe they were. \\nThrough February 2013, we did computer searches for randomized controlled trials of the skin patch or vaginal ring compared to pills for birth control. Pills included types with both estrogen and progestin. We wrote to researchers to find other trials. \\nWe found 18 trials. Of six patch trials, five compared the marketed patch to birth control pills and one studied a patch being developed. Of 12 ring trials, 11 looked at the marketed ring and pills while one studied a ring being developed. The methods compared had similar pregnancy rates. Patch users reported using their method more consistently than the pill group did. Only half of the patch studies had data on pregnancy or whether the women used the method correctly. However, most of the ring studies had those data. \\nPatch users were more likely than pill users to drop out early from the trial. Ring users were not more likely to drop out early. Compared to pill users, users of the marketed patch had more breast discomfort, painful periods, nausea, and vomiting. Ring users had more vaginal irritation and discharge than pill users but less nausea, acne, irritability, depression, and emotional changes. Ring users often had fewer bleeding problems than pill users. \\nThe quality of information was classed as low for the patch trials and moderate for the ring studies. Lower quality was due to not reporting how groups were assigned or not having good outcome measures. Other issues were high losses and taking assigned women out of the analysis. Studies of the patch and ring should provide more detail on whether women used the method correctly. \\n', '10.1002-14651858.CD013163.pub2-pls.txt': 'Systematic review of lipid emulsions for intravenous nutrition in preterm infants.\\nReview question: which lipid (fat) emulsions (LE) have the best outcomes in preterm infants with and without liver disease and surgical conditions? \\nBackground: preterm infants who need nutrition (feeding) through intravenous (into a vein; called parenteral nutrition) lines have been conventionally given pure soybean oil‐based fat emulsions. However, high polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) content and phytosterols in pure soybean oil‐based emulsions may be harmful and contribute to parenteral nutrition‐associated liver disease (PNALD). The newer lipid emulsions (LE) from alternative lipid sources, including fish oil, may potentially improve clinical outcomes in preterm infants by decreasing PUFA content and providing lipid source‐specific benefits. \\nStudy characteristics: we searched the medical literature and identified 29 studies (including 2037 preterm infants). The evidence is up to date as of 18 June 2018. \\nKey findings: in the population of preterm infants, without liver disease or surgical conditions, no particular LE was better than another for growth, liver disease, death, retinopathy (eye disease), infection and chronic lung disease. \\nWhile there was very low quality and limited evidence to suggest that fish oil‐based LE may improve liver disease‐related outcomes in infants with pre‐existing liver disease, this evidence was based on a limited number of infants from two small studies, one of which was terminated early, and no certain conclusions can be drawn. \\nConclusions: based on this review, no particular LE is better than another for intravenous nutrition in preterm infants. There currently exists insufficient evidence from well‐designed studies about the benefit of fish oil‐LE for improving liver disease‐related outcomes in infants with pre‐existing liver disease or surgical conditions. Further research is required to establish the role of fish oil‐LE for liver disease outcomes in preterm infants and the ideal composition of LE for preterm infants. \\n', '10.1002-14651858.CD013787-pls.txt': 'How accurate are routine laboratory tests for diagnosis of COVID‐19?\\nWhat are routine laboratory tests? \\nRoutine laboratory tests are blood tests that assess the health status of a patient. Tests include counts of different types of white blood cells (these help the body fight infection), and detection of markers (proteins) that indicate organ damage, and general inflammation. These tests are widely available and in some places they may be the only tests available for diagnosis of COVID‐19. \\nWhat did we want to find out? \\nPeople with suspected COVID‐19 need to know quickly whether they are infected so that they can self‐isolate, receive treatment, and inform close contacts. \\nCurrently, the standard test for COVID‐19 is usually the RT‐PCR test. In the RT‐PCR, samples from the nose and throat are sent away for testing, usually to a large, central laboratory with specialist equipment. Other tests include imaging tests, like X‐rays, which also require specialist equipment. \\nWe wanted to know whether routine laboratory tests were sufficiently accurate to diagnose COVID‐19 in people with suspected COVID‐19. We also wanted to know whether they were accurate enough to prioritize patients for different levels of treatment. \\nWhat did we do? \\nWe searched for studies that assessed the accuracy of routine laboratory tests to diagnose COVID‐19 compared with RT‐PCR or other tests. Studies could be of any design and be set anywhere in the world. Studies could include participants of any age or sex, with suspected COVID‐19, or use samples from people known to have – or not to have ‐ COVID‐19. \\nWhat we found \\nWe found 21 studies that looked at 67 different routine laboratory tests for COVID‐19. Most of the studies looked at how accurately these tests diagnosed infection with the virus causing COVID‐19. Four studies included both children and adults, 16 included only adults and one study only children. Seventeen studies were done in China, and one each in Iran, Italy, Taiwan and the USA. All studies took place in hospitals, except one that used samples from a database. Most studies used RT‐PCR to confirm COVID‐19 diagnosis. \\nAccuracy of tests is most often reported using ‘sensitivity’ and ‘specificity’. Sensitivity is the proportion of people with COVID‐19 correctly detected by the test; specificity is the proportion of people without COVID‐19 who are correctly identified by the test. The nearer sensitivity and specificity are to 100%, the better the test. A test to prioritize people for treatment would require a high sensitivity of more than 80%. \\nWhere four or more studies evaluated a particular test, we pooled their results and analyzed them together. Our analyses showed that only three of the tests had both sensitivity and specificity over 50%. Two of these were markers for general inflammation (increases in interleukin‐6 and C‐reactive protein). The third was for lymphocyte count decrease. Lymphocytes are a type of white blood cell where a low count might indicate infection. \\nHow reliable are the results? \\nOur confidence in the evidence from this review is low because the studies were different from each other, which made them difficult to compare. For example, some included very sick people, while some included people with hardly any COVID‐19 symptoms. Also, the diagnosis of COVID‐19 was confirmed in different ways: RT‐PCR was sometimes used in combination with other tests. \\nWho do the results of this review apply to? \\nRoutine laboratory tests can be issued by most healthcare facilities. However, our results are probably not representative of most clinical situations in which these tests are being used. Most studies included very sick people with high rates of COVID‐19 virus infection of between 27% and 76%. In most primary healthcare facilities, this percentage will be lower. \\nWhat does this mean? \\nRoutine laboratory tests cannot distinguish between COVID‐19 and other diseases as the cause of infection, inflammation or tissue damage. None of the tests performed well enough to be a standalone diagnostic test for COVID‐19 nor to prioritize patients for treatment. They will mainly be used to provide an overall picture about the health status of the patient. The final COVID‐19 diagnosis has to be made based on other tests. \\nHow up‐to‐date is this review? \\nWe searched all COVID‐19 studies up to 4 May 2020.\\n', '10.1002-14651858.CD014953.pub2-pls.txt': 'Can virtual reality training for cataract surgery supplement or replace other training methods for ophthalmology trainees? \\nKey messagesWe did not find enough evidence to show that virtual reality (VR) training improves cataract surgery performance among ophthalmology trainees compared to wet lab or conventional training. \\nWhat is virtual reality training?VR training uses computer technology to simulate a three‐dimensional interactive environment. \\nHow does cataract surgery training work in ophthalmology trainees?Most postgraduate ophthalmology trainees in the United States (US) transition gradually from performing specific cataract surgery (replacing the cloudy lens inside the eye with an artificial one) steps in a wet laboratory (practicing on cadaver or artificial tissues) or using VR simulators to performing cataract surgery in the operating room. \\nWhy is this question important?VR training is becoming increasingly common in postgraduate ophthalmology training, but comprehensive reviews of the impact of VR training on trainees’\\xa0cataract surgery performance are lacking. \\nWhat did we want to find out?The primary aim of this review was to determine whether VR training improved operating room performance (measured by operating time in the operating room, intraoperative [during the operation] complications, or postoperative [after the operation] complications) in cataract surgery for postgraduate ophthalmology trainees. The secondary aim was to identify the impact of VR training on operating time in simulated settings, supervising physician ratings in the operating room or simulator settings, or VR simulation task ratings. \\nHow did we identify and evaluate the evidence?We searched for studies that compared VR training to other training methods such as traditional wet laboratory training or no supplementary training in a postgraduate\\xa0ophthalmology trainee population. \\nWhat did we find?VR relative to conventional or wet laboratory training did not impact operating times, the rate of intraoperative complications, or supervising physician ratings in the operating room. However, compared to trainees without supplementary training, VR‐trained trainees received higher supervising physician ratings in the operating room. The quality of evidence for all outcomes was very low. \\nWhat does this mean?VR training is a promising intervention for teaching cataract surgery, but more rigorous, evidence‐based studies are needed to gauge its impact on key outcomes such as intraoperative and postoperative complications.\\xa0 \\nHow up‐to‐date is the evidence?The evidence is current up to 14 June 2021. \\n', '10.1002-14651858.CD013876.pub3-pls.txt': \"Interventions for the treatment of persistent smell disorders (olfactory dysfunction) after COVID‐19 infection \\nWhy this is important \\nThe sense of smell is critical to one's enjoyment of odours and\\xa0tastes, and is important for safety. During the COVID‐19 pandemic there has been an increasing focus on change in sense of smell as one of the early symptoms associated with infection. This can be a reduction, change or complete loss of the sense of smell. For most people this is temporary, however for some this lasts weeks or even months. If a person has lost their sense of smell for a long time (over four weeks after having COVID‐19), we do not know if there are any treatments that might help it to recover.\\xa0 \\nHow we identified and assessed the evidence \\nWe searched the medical literature, identifying relevant studies and summarising the results. We assessed the quality of the studies as well as the certainty of the evidence.

PDA is an open vascular channel between the lungs and the heart which usually closes shortly after birth. In preterm infants, the PDA frequently remains open and may contribute to life‐threatening complications. COX‐I drugs such as indomethacin, ibuprofen and acetaminophen may prevent a PDA and related poor outcomes. Controversy exists on which of the three COX‐I drugs, if any, improves clinical outcomes in preterm infants. \\nStudy characteristics \\nWe searched scientific databases for randomized controlled trials (clinical studies where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups) in preterm babies (born at less than 37 weeks into pregnancy) or low‐birthweight (weighing less than 2500 grams) infants where COX‐I drugs were given without the prior knowledge of the presence of a PDA, within the first 72 hours after birth. The included studies compared administration of indomethacin or ibuprofen or acetaminophen versus each other, placebo or no treatment.\\xa0 \\nKey results \\nThis review of 28 clinical trials (3999 preterm infants) found that prophylactic indomethacin probably results in a small reduction in severe brain bleeding, a moderate reduction in death and need for PDA surgery, and may result in a small increase in chronic lung disease. Prophylactic indomethacin likely results in trivial differences in necrotizing enterocolitis, gastrointestinal perforation and cerebral palsy. Prophylactic ibuprofen probably results in a small reduction in severe brain bleeding and a moderate reduction in need for PDA surgery.

Treatment is therefore aimed at relieving symptoms. Respiratory infections are commonly caused by viruses, especially colds and flu, though some lung and ear infections are caused by bacteria. It may be difficult to distinguish between viral and bacterial infections, and they may coexist. Antibiotics are often prescribed for respiratory infections even though they are ineffective against viruses. \\nChildren have on average three to six respiratory tract infections annually. Although most are mild and treatable, they sometimes require hospital treatment, and very rarely result in death. \\nHomeopathy may treat respiratory infections with few side effects, but its effectiveness and safety has not been well researched. \\nWe assessed evidence from randomised controlled trials (studies that allocate people by chance to receive treatment), which is the best way to assess the safety and efficacy of medical treatments. \\nSearch date \\nOur evidence is current to 27 November 2017.\\nStudy characteristics \\nWe included eight studies involving 1562 children that compared oral homeopathic treatment to either placebo or standard treatment to prevent or treat respiratory infections in children. All studies investigated upper respiratory tract (from the nose to the windpipe (trachea)) infections, but one combined reporting of upper and lower respiratory tract (from the windpipe to the lungs and pleura (membranes covering the lungs)) infections, so the numbers of children with upper or lower infections is unknown. \\nStudy funding sources \\nThree studies received funding from homeopathy manufacturers; one reported support from a non‐government organisation; two received government support; one was cosponsored by a university; and one did not report funding support. \\nKey results \\nStudies investigated a range of interventions for various illnesses and populations using different outcome measures, so only a small number could be combined for analysis. All moderate‐quality studies (low risk of bias) showed little or no beneficial effects for homeopathic medicinal products, whether individualised by a trained homeopath or a standard, non‐individualised commercially available therapy. Where results could be combined, there was probably little or no difference in benefit on short‐ or long‐term cure, or in prevention of ARTI. \\nTwo low‐quality studies (unclear or high risk of bias) showed some benefit of homeopathic medicinal products for a limited number of outcomes. One study showed a reduction in disease severity for the homeopathy group at some time points. The other study showed a reduction in number of respiratory infections over the following year in the treatment groups, although more than a quarter of participants were not accounted for in the results. There was no difference between homeopathy and placebo groups for parents' time off work, antibiotic use, or adverse effects. Consequently, there is no convincing evidence homeopathic medicinal products are effective in treating ARTIs in children. We are unsure about safety because data on adverse events were poorly reported. \\nQuality of the evidence \\nWe rated evidence as moderate or low quality for most outcomes. Three outcomes provided very low‐quality evidence because study populations and results differed significantly among studies; there were significant limitations in study design and reporting; and sample sizes were small. \\n\", '10.1002-14651858.CD009487.pub3-abstract.txt': 'Lateral pararectal versus transrectal stoma placement for prevention of parastomal herniation \\nWe asked \\nIs there a difference in the rate of parastomal herniation, and other stoma‐related complications in people undergoing abdominal wall enterostomy, when comparing two stoma formation techniques: lateral pararectal, in which the stoma is located beside the rectus abdominis muscle, one of the muscles of the abdominal wall, versus transrectal, in which the stoma is pulled through the rectus abdominis muscle? \\nBackground \\nA stoma is an opening in the abdomen, which is surgically created to divert the flow of urine or feces; an enterostomy is a stoma that starts in the bowel. A parastomal hernia is an incisional hernia, through which abdominal contents protrude through a defect in the abdominal wall at the site of previous surgery. It is related to a stoma, and is one of the most common stoma‐related complications. Many factors that potentially influence the occurrence of parastomal herniation have been investigated. However, it remains unclear whether the enterostomy should be placed through or beside the rectus abdominis muscle in order to prevent parastomal herniation. \\nStudy characteristics \\nThe evidence is current to 9 November 2018. In this update, we included 10 retrospective cohort studies with a total of 864 participants, and one randomized controlled trial (RCT: a study in which participants are randomly allocated to the treatment groups), including 60 participants. The target population was individuals, regardless of age, who received a temporary or permanent enterostomy for any reason in either the elective (planned) or the emergency setting. \\nKey results \\nThe results found inconclusive results between the two techniques for the risk of parastomal herniation (11 studies, 924 participants), stomal prolapse (1 study, 145 participants), ileus or stenosis (1 study, 60 participants), and skin irritation (1 study, 60 participants). \\nNeither technique was found to be better than the other for any of the stoma‐related outcomes of interest. \\nNone of the studies measured other stoma‐related problems, or death.\\nQuality of the evidence \\nWe downgraded the quality of the evidence to moderate, low, or very low, because of high risk of bias, small sample sizes, few events, and diversity across studies. \\nConclusion \\nBased on the current knowledge presented in this review, there is no evidence to support the use of one stoma formation technique over the other.

Future research should focus on well‐designed studies with robust methods. \\n‐ We identified 21 studies on this topic that are ongoing. We will update this review when more evidence becomes available. \\nWhat is the link between vitamin D and COVID‐19? \\nSome studies have shown that people who are in hospital with severe COVID‐19 also have low levels of \\xa0vitamin D (vitamin D deficiency). However, the risk factors for developing severe COVID‐19 are the same as those for developing vitamin D deficiency, so it is difficult to tell if vitamin D deficiency itself is a risk factor for severe COVID‐19. Risk factors include general ill‐health, a poor diet, and pre‐existing health conditions, such as diabetes, and liver and kidney disease. \\nVitamin D is important for healthy bones, teeth and muscles. It helps to regulate blood sugar, the heart and blood vessels, and the lungs and airways. It also has a role in boosting the body’s immune system. These are areas affected by COVID‐19, so giving vitamin D to people with COVID‐19 might help them to recover more quickly or have the disease less severely. \\nWhat did we want to find out? \\nWe wanted to find out the effects of giving vitamin D to adults with confirmed COVID‐19 on the following: \\n‐ death from any cause;\\n‐ improvement or worsening of the patient’s condition;\\n‐ unwanted effects; and\\n‐ quality of life.\\nWhat did we do? \\nWe searched for studies that assessed the use of vitamin D as a treatment for adults with confirmed COVID‐19 compared with a placebo (sham treatment) or another treatment. Vitamin D could be given in any form and in any dose. \\nWe compared and summarised their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes. \\nWhat did we find? \\nWe found three studies with 356 participants. One study took place in Brazil, and the other two in Spain. Two studies had participants with severe COVID‐19 and one had participants with mild COVID‐19 or with no symptoms. All the participants tested positive for COVID‐19 with a laboratory test called ‘PCR’, which is currently the most accurate test available. \\nThe studies gave their participants different doses of vitamin D. They used different timings from each other, from one large dose in one study to several smaller doses over 14 days in another study. Only two studies said that their participants were vitamin D‐deficient. The other study did not say anything about their participants’ vitamin D status. \\nDeaths from any causeWe do not know whether vitamin D helps to prevent death from COVID‐19. Two studies (in participants with severe COVID‐19) provided evidence about deaths from any cause. One reported no deaths in the 50 participants who had received vitamin D, but two \\xa0deaths in the 26 participants who received the hospital’s usual COVID‐19 treatment. The other study reported nine deaths in 119 participants who had been given vitamin D and six deaths in the 118 participants given placebo. These studies were too different from each other to allow us to draw any conclusions. \\nPatient’s conditionVitamin D may reduce the need for patients to be put on a ventilator to help them breathe, but the evidence is uncertain. One study (in participants with severe COVID‐19) reported that nine out of 119 participants given vitamin D had to be put on a ventilator and 17 out of 118 given a placebo needed a ventilator. \\nUnwanted effectsWe do not know whether vitamin D causes unwanted effects. Only one study (in participants with severe COVID‐19) reported data on unwanted effects in a way that we could use. It found that one participant out of 119 vomited shortly after being given vitamin D. \\nQuality of lifeNone of the studies reported quality of life. \\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence? \\nOur confidence in the evidence is very limited because the studies gave different doses of vitamin D at different times from each other, did not all report participants’ vitamin D status, and did not measure and record their results using consistent methods. \\nWe found little evidence on unwanted effects and none on quality of life. \\xa0\\nHow up to date is this evidence? \\nThe evidence is up to date to 11 March 2021.\\n', '10.1002-14651858.CD013285.pub2-pls.txt': \"Exercise versus airway clearance for people with cystic fibrosis\\nReview question \\nCan exercise replace other methods of airway clearance for people with cystic fibrosis (CF)? \\nBackground \\nCF affects many systems in the body, mainly the respiratory system. It causes a build‐up of thick, sticky mucus in the lungs which causes irritation and damage to the lining of the airways. CF treatment involves chest physiotherapy, also called airway clearance, which uses a range of devices or techniques to get rid of this mucus. It has been suggested that exercise may have a similar effect. Exercising results in a person taking different volumes and depths of breaths. This leads to pressure changes and forces within the airways that move secretions out of the lungs. We compared the effect on lung function of exercise versus other techniques, to see if exercise is a suitable alternative for people with CF. We wanted to answer our review question to potentially reduce their treatment burden. \\nSearch date \\nThe evidence is current to 15 February 2022.\\nStudy characteristics \\nWe searched the literature for studies where people received at least two treatment sessions of exercise or another airway clearance technique, and report on four studies including 86 people with CF in the review. The people in the studies were aged between 7 and 41 years and had varying degrees of disease severity. Three studies included people who were clinically well and one study included people admitted to hospital for a chest infection. The studies lasted between four days and six months and compared exercise (alone or in combination with another airway clearance technique) to other techniques. Two studies compared exercise with postural drainage and percussion (PD&P), one study compared exercise with the active cycle of breathing technique (ACBT) and one study compared exercise with underwater positive expiratory pressure (uPEP), also known as bubble PEP. Three studies received financial support from funding bodies such as the Cystic Fibrosis Trust, the Buffalo Foundation and the Romanian National Council for Scientific Research in Higher Education. \\nKey results \\nWe did not find enough evidence to conclude whether or not exercise can replace other methods of airway clearance. We did not find any evidence to suggest that exercise was either better or worse than other methods to improve lung function or clear mucus from the airways, although exercising did improve people's exercise ability, and it was the preferred choice of treatment in one study. None of the studies reported any negative effects of exercise therapy. None of the studies evaluated quality of life or the need for extra antibiotic treatment. One study did suggest that exercise alone was less effective at clearing sputum than ACBT. \\nExercise versus ACBT \\nOne study (18 participants) found that a measure of lung function temporarily (up to 30 minutes) increased in the exercise group only, otherwise there was no difference between the ACBT or the exercise group. No adverse events were reported, and it is not certain if ACBT was thought to be more effective or was preferred. The exercise group produced less sputum than the ACBT group. The study did not report on exercise capacity, quality of life, adherence, hospitalisations and need for additional antibiotics. \\nExercise plus PD&P versus PD&P alone \\nTwo studies (55 participants) compared exercise plus PD&P to PD&P alone. At two weeks, one trial described a greater increase in lung function with PD&P alone, while at six months the second study reported a greater increase with exercise plus PD&P (but did not provide data for the PD&P group). One study reported no side effects at all, and also reported no difference between groups in exercise capacity (maximal work rate), sputum volume or the average length of time spent in hospital. Conversely, the second study reported fewer hospitalisations due to exacerbations in the exercise and PD&P group. Neither study reported on quality of life, preference and the need for antibiotics. \\nExercise versus uPEP \\nOne study (13 participants) compared exercise to uPEP (also known as bubble PEP). No adverse events were recorded in either group and investigators reported that those taking part thought that, while exercise was more tiring, it was also more enjoyable than bubble PEP. We found no differences in the total weight of sputum collected during treatment sessions. The study did not report on lung function, quality of life, exercise capacity, adherence, need for antibiotics or hospitalisations. \\nCertainty of the evidence \\nOverall, we had very little confidence in the evidence because all four studies had few participants and two studies only presented results as a shortened report given at a conference.\\xa0 \\nWe do not think the fact that participants and people measuring the outcomes knew which treatment the participants were receiving influenced the results of outcomes such as lung function and sputum weight. We do not think the fact that these studies were financed should influence the interpretation of the results in this review.\\xa0 \\n\", '10.1002-14651858.CD009961.pub2-abstract.txt': 'Preventing bleeding in people with congenital bleeding disorders during and after surgery \\nIn haemophilia and other congenital bleeding disorders blood does not clot properly, which can cause excessive bleeding. This is particularly relevant during surgery, when the risk of bleeding depends on the type and severity of the clotting disorder and on the type of surgery. Therefore, during and after surgery, these individuals should receive treatment to improve the ability of their blood to clot and so prevent bleeding. Clotting factor concentrates (when available and appropriate in those individuals missing specific clotting proteins) or other non‐specific drugs for clotting, or a combination of both, are administered. It is not known what is the optimal dose or duration or method of administration of these treatments in these circumstances. \\nWe searched for randomised controlled trials comparing the efficacy (mortality, blood loss, need for re‐intervention, subjective assessment of efficacy, duration and dose of therapy) and the safety of any type of treatment given to people with congenital bleeding disorders during any type of surgery. We found four trials to be included in this review. Two trials evaluated 59 people with haemophilia A or B receiving antifibrinolytic drugs (agents that reduce the breakdown of clots) or placebo in addition to the initial standard treatment before dental extractions. The remaining two trials evaluated 53 people with haemophilia A or B and inhibitors (antibodies that act against the factor concentrate therapy) receiving an different clotting concentrate, recombinant activated factor VII, both during and after surgery. These two trials evaluated different treatment options: high‐dose compared with low‐dose and a single large (bolus) infusion compared with continuous infusion. \\nThe trials included in this review provide some information in two specific situations in people with congenital bleeding disorders undergoing surgery. However, on the whole, there is not enough evidence from trials to define the best treatments for the various types of disease and types of surgery. Further trials would be useful to improve our knowledge but are difficult to carry out and currently do not appear to be a clinical priority. Indeed, both major and minor surgery are safely performed in clinical practice in these individuals based on local experience and data from uncontrolled studies. \\n', '10.1002-14651858.CD013483.pub2-pls.txt': 'How accurate are contrast‐enhanced ultrasound scans for detecting hepatocellular carcinoma?\\nKey messages \\nIn adults with chronic liver disease, contrast‐enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) can miss diagnosing hepatocellular carcinoma in around 22.2% of people who would not then receive timely or appropriate treatment, and would fail to diagnose hepatocellular carcinoma in 6.2% of people who could receive unnecessary further testing or treatment. \\nIn the subset of people who are able have the hepatocellular carcinoma removed by surgery, CEUS probably misses hepatocellular carcinoma in 22.5% of people who could undergo surgery to remove part of their liver while it would erroneously find cancer in 7.3% of people who would undergo unnecessary further test or surgery. \\nAs there were some problems with the way the studies were conducted, CEUS to detect hepatocellular carcinoma may appear more accurate than it actually is. \\nWhy is improving the diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma important? \\nHepatocellular carcinoma is cancer originating in the liver. It is sixth in terms of occurrences of cancer and fourth in terms of cancer‐related deaths worldwide. It occurs mostly in people with chronic liver disease regardless of the exact cause. People with blood test or ultrasound results that suggest they may have hepatocellular carcinoma may go on to have further tests, such as imaging or a biopsy (where a small piece of the liver is removed and examined). If the cancer is detected early, people may have part of the liver removed or have a liver transplant. In advanced hepatocellular carcinoma, they may need chemotherapy. If hepatocellular carcinoma is missed at diagnostic testing, people will not receive appropriate treatment. However, incorrectly diagnosing hepatocellular carcinoma when it is not present means that people may undergo unnecessary testing or treatment. \\nWhat is contrast‐enhanced ultrasound and how can it diagnose hepatocellular carcinoma? \\nCEUS can detect abnormalities in the liver that might be due to cancer and, using contrast agents, confirm the diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma. These contrast agents are safe. CEUS is used in clinical practice to confirm the presence of hepatocellular carcinoma in people in whom suspicion was raised by prior performed abdominal ultrasound or a blood test to measure alpha‐foetoprotein. \\nThe role of CEUS in the diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma remains controversial between guidelines. Previous systematic reviews have assessed the performance of CEUS in detecting hepatocellular carcinoma but they have included different studies and found different results. \\nWhat did we want to find out? \\nWe wanted to find out if CEUS is accurate enough to diagnose hepatocellular carcinoma in adults with chronic liver disease (a progressive deterioration of liver functions for more than six months). We were interested first in hepatocellular carcinoma of any size and severity and, second, in hepatocellular carcinomas that were suitable for surgical removal (resection). \\nWhat did we do? \\nWe searched for studies that assessed the accuracy of diagnostic tests of CEUS scans compared to the best available tests to confirm hepatocellular carcinoma in adults with chronic liver disease. The best available test is examination of the liver, or part of it, under a microscope. \\nWhat did we find? \\nWe found 23 studies with 6546 adults.\\nAround 690 (69%) out of 1000 adults with chronic liver disease had a confirmed hepatocellular carcinoma of any size and severity.

Eczema typically starts in childhood, but can improve with age. Eczema is caused by a combination of genetics and environmental factors, which lead to skin barrier dysfunction. Eczema can negatively impact quality of life, and the societal cost is significant. \\nHow is eczema treated? \\nEczema treatments are often creams or ointments that reduce itch\\xa0and redness, applied directly to the skin. If these are unsuccessful, systemic medicines that affect the whole body, or phototherapy are options.

It is caused by the decreasing level of oxygen at increasingly high altitudes; and it can be experienced when reaching a high altitude when travelling, hiking or climbing mountains or other elevated areas. People going to altitudes over 4000 metres, females, people younger than mid‐adulthood , and people with a history of migraine are at greater risk of suffering from altitude sickness. The most common symptoms are headache, loss of appetite , insomnia, and nausea. However, severe forms can include confusion, difficulty walking, progressive cough, shortness of breath, and even death. \\nReview question \\nWhat are the benefits and risks of different treatments for people suffering from high altitude illness? \\nStudy characteristics \\nWe included 13 studies with a total of 468 participants. Most studies included participants with mild or moderate forms of mountain sickness, and only one study included the severe neurological (disorder of the nervous system) form. Follow‐up was usually less than one day. We also identified two ongoing studies. \\nKey results \\nWe found studies evaluating the following interventions: simulated descent with a hyperbaric chamber (medical use of oxygen in a special chamber at greater than atmospheric pressure to increase the availability of oxygen in the body); oxygen; medicines: acetazolamide, dexamethasone, ibuprofen, paracetamol, gabapentin, sumatriptan, nitric oxide, and magnesium sulphate. None of the studies reported the effects of these interventions on all‐cause mortality. The report of complete relief from acute mountain sickness symptoms, and adverse events was infrequent. Studies related to simulated descent with the use of a hyperbaric chamber did not find additional benefits or harms related to this intervention (3 studies, 124 participants). In addition, studies related to administration of medicines found some benefits in terms of reduction of symptoms with the use of acetazolamide (2 studies, 25 participants), and dexamethasone (1 study, 35 participants), without an increase in side effects. \\nQuality of the evidence \\nThe quality of the evidence we found was low, and thus our certainty in the findings is limited. There was insufficient information on how the studies were conducted, and in some cases there was evidence of tampering at some stages of the trials. Furthermore, the number of persons in each study was very small (< 30 participants), and therefore the results were not clear (imprecise). Some studies were not blinded (that is, participants knew what experimental treatment they were receiving), and this could have affected how the participants evaluated their own symptoms. \\n', '10.1002-14651858.CD013069.pub2-abstract.txt': 'Cognitive training for people with mild to moderate dementia\\nBackground \\nDementia due to Alzheimer’s and other diseases is a leading cause of disability and an enormous health and societal problem. More than 40 million people in the world currently live with dementia, and this number is expected to increase to more than 115 million by the year 2050. Effective treatments to reduce the burden of dementia are urgently needed. Cognitive training (CT) is a non‐pharmacological form of treatment that focuses on guided practice on tasks that target specific cognitive functions, such as memory, attention, or problem‐solving. Whether CT can help people with mild to moderate dementia maintain or improve their thinking, well‐being, and general functioning remains unclear. \\nMain findings \\nWe analysed data from 33 studies of CT that included a total of approximately 2000 participants and were conducted in 12 countries. We found that, compared with receiving usual treatment or engaging in non‐specific activities, people completing CT may show some benefits in overall cognition, as well as in more specific cognitive abilities such as verbal fluency, and that improvements may last for at least a few months. We did not find any evidence that participating in CT was associated with increased burden for participants. However, we also found no evidence that CT was better than participating in other active treatments. \\nLimitations of this review \\nThe quality of the studies we reviewed varied but overall was not very high, so our certainty in some of these findings is low. Future studies should continue improving on quality, should continue comparing CT with other treatments, and should follow participants for a longer period to understand whether observed benefits for cognition last beyond the short or medium term. \\n', '10.1002-14651858.CD009134.pub2-abstract.txt': \"Noninvasive positive pressure ventilation for acute respiratory failure following upper abdominal surgery \\nReview question \\nThe goal of this review was to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NPPV) (continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) or bilevel NPPV) compared with oxygen therapy alone in adults with acute respiratory failure after upper abdominal surgery. \\nBackground \\nAcute respiratory failure , where fluid builds up in the lungs stopping oxygen from crossing into the blood, is a relatively common complication after abdominal surgery and can increase the risk of dying (mortality). \\nNPPV is a type of treatment that helps to improve breathing without having to insert a tube inside a person's windpipe (tracheal intubation). This intervention is effective in several illnesses. \\nStudy characteristics \\nWe searched scientific databases for clinical trials looking at the treatment of adults with acute respiratory failure following abdominal surgery. The trials compared NPPV with usual care(oxygen therapy through a face mask). We included two trials involving 269 participants.The participants were mostly men (67%) and on average 65 years of age. One trial was conducted in several intensive care units (ICU). Both trials included adults with acute respiratory failure after upper abdominal surgery. The evidence is current to May 2015. \\nKey results \\nThis review examined mortality, rate of tracheal intubation, length of stay in the ICU, length of hospital stay, complications after NPPV, and changes in the levels of gases within the blood (arterial blood gases). \\nCompared with oxygen therapy, NPPV decreased the rate of tracheal intubation. Out of every 1000 adults who developed acute respiratory failure after upper abdominal surgery, 181 adults treated with oxygen therapy would need to be intubated compared with 54 adults treated with NPPV. \\nWhen compared to oxygen therapy, NPPV tended to reduce mortality. However, since the number of participants included in the two trials was small, more studies are needed. \\nThe use of NPPV also reduced the length of stay in the ICU by almost two days when compared to oxygen therapy. However, the mean length of stay in the hospital was similar in the two groups. \\nWhen compared to oxygen therapy, NPPV improved blood gas levels one hour after the intervention. \\nThere was insufficient evidence to be certain that CPAP or NPPV had an effect on anastomotic (e.g. where two pieces of intestine are joined together) leakage, pneumonia related complications and sepsis (blood poisoning) or infections. However, adults treated with NPPV had lower rates these complications than adults treated with oxygen. \\nQuality of the evidence \\nThere was low quality evidence for hospital mortality, low quality of evidence for rate of tracheal intubation, and very low quality of evidence for ICU length of stay. \\nAuthors' conclusions \\nThe findings of this review showed that NPPV is an effective and safe treatment for adults with acute respiratory failure after upper abdominal surgery. However, due to the low quality of the evidence, more good quality studies are needed to confirm these findings. \\n\", '10.1002-14651858.CD009949.pub2-abstract.txt': 'Aspiration of the elbow joint for treating radial head fractures\\nWhat is a radial head fracture? \\nThe radial head is the topmost part of the radius, which is one of the two forearm bones. The radial head is part of the elbow joint. Fracture or breaking of the radial head is the most common elbow fracture. This injury usually results from a fall onto an outstretched arm. The symptoms of a radial head fracture are pain, swelling and bruising around the elbow, as well as restricted movement. \\nWhat is aspiration? \\nOne treatment for radial head fracture is aspiration. This is a procedure where a sterile needle and syringe are used to drain excess fluid and blood from the elbow joint to relieve pressure and thus, in theory, relieve pain and improve clinical outcome. However, aspiration is an invasive procedure that puts the patient at further risk of complications, such as infection and injury to nerves and vessels. The procedure is typically done in the first few days after injury. \\nAim of the review \\nWe aimed to assess the effects (benefits and harms) of aspiration of the elbow joint for treating radial head fracture in adults. \\nDescription of the studies included in the review  We searched the medical literature up to April 2014 and found two relevant studies that reported results for a total of 108 people with radial head fractures. Most participants were adults, aged 30 or over. They generally had less serious fractures and were all treated without surgery. The two studies were small, poorly reported and at high risk of bias. Neither study used reliable measures to assess function or pain. Consequently, we are very unsure of the findings of these trials. \\nSummary of the evidence \\nVery low quality evidence showed little difference between those who had joint aspiration and those who did not in being unable to carry heavy loads or having discomfort when carrying loads using their previously injured arm at one year after injury. Very low quality evidence shows that aspiration often provides immediate pain relief and may still provide pain relief at three weeks. Neither trial reported on adverse events from the procedure, but aspiration was reported as being unsuccessful in three participants of one study. Very low quality evidence shows little effect of aspiration on being able to extend the elbow at either six weeks or one year. The reporting of adverse events was incomplete, but one trial reported the absence of three common complications of radial head fractures. \\nConclusions \\nOverall, there is not enough evidence to say whether aspiration gives better short‐term or longer‐term results than no aspiration in treating radial head fractures or how safe it is. We suggest that further research is needed to examine the use of aspiration for the initial treatment of radial head fractures. \\n', '10.1002-14651858.CD013491.pub2-pls.txt': \"Predicting relapse or recurrence of depression\\nWhat is the aim of this review? \\nRelapse and recurrence (becoming unwell again after making an improvement) are common in depression and lead to increased disability and decreased quality of life for patients. Relapse is a re‐emergence of the initial episode of depression after some initial improvement, whereas recurrence is the onset of a new episode of depression after recovery. Outcomes, such as relapse and recurrence, can sometimes be predicted while people are well, using information available at the time. A mathematical calculation can be performed to assess an individual person's risk; this calculation is known as a 'prognostic model' or a prediction tool. In most health services, including the National Health Service (NHS) in the UK, resources such as doctors and therapists need to be used in the best way possible, for the people who will gain the most benefit from them. If accurate prediction tools are available, the information can be used to identify the most 'high risk' patients and make sure they receive additional support to try to prevent a relapse or a recurrence. \\nThe aim of this review was to identify studies that have attempted to develop a prediction tool for relapse or recurrence of depression in adults. We were interested in studies that had attempted to make this prediction while patients were well. We also included tools that predicted the chance of patients staying well. If we had found multiple studies that tested the same prediction tool, we planned to combine these to work out a better summary of how well that tool worked. \\nKey messages \\nWe identified 10 prediction tools (over 11 studies) for relapse or recurrence. These were either not proven to be good at predicting relapse/recurrence, or the studies had problems with how they were carried out, meaning that none of the prediction tools were at a stage where they could be used in the real world. Further work is needed to improve prediction of relapse or recurrence of depression. \\nWhat was studied in the review? \\nWe collected and analysed the results of 11 relevant studies. We were interested in several things: how researchers had defined relapse and recurrence (for example, whether they had used clinical interviews or self‐report questionnaires to diagnose depressive symptoms); what information was gathered to help make predictions; the techniques used by the researchers to help develop the tools; and how well the tools predicted. We were also interested in whether the tools were tested in a separate group of participants, which is essential to ensure that the model can predict accurately in patients in the real world. \\nFinally, we assessed the studies to determine how confident we could be in the results, given the approaches taken by researchers (this is called 'risk of bias') and how relevant the studies were to our review (this is called 'applicability'). \\nWhat are the main results of the review? \\nWe found 11 studies. Ten of these developed different models and one study tested one of the models developed in a previous study. It was not possible to combine results for any particular tool. \\nTen of the 11 studies were rated at high risk of bias. This means that we cannot be confident in the results that were presented, due to some issues with the way the studies were conducted. The most common issue was that there were not enough participants included in the studies. Other common problems involved the statistical approaches used by the researchers. \\nOne study was at low overall risk of bias, which means that we can be more confident in trusting the results. However, this tool did not make accurate predictions about relapse or recurrence. \\nWe found no studies that could be used in clinical practice; further work is needed to develop tools for predicting relapse or recurrence of depression. \\nHow up‐to‐date is the review? \\nThe literature search for this review was completed in May 2020.\\n\", '10.1002-14651858.CD013297.pub2-pls.txt': \"What are the benefits and risks of surgery for epiretinal membrane (a disease of the eye)? \\nWhy is this question important?An epiretinal membrane is an abnormal layer of tissue that develops at the back of the eye. It affects around one in five people aged 75 years and older. In most people, the development of an epiretinal membrane is linked to the normal ageing processes in the eye and is described as 'idiopathic'. In other instances, epiretinal membrane is caused by a pre‐existing condition affecting the retina, such as inflammation or poor circluation. Epiretinal membrane can also develop after eye surgery. \\nEpiretinal membrane typically forms over the part of the eye responsible for seeing fine detail (the macula). In some people, this does not affect vision. In others, it causes distorted or blurred vision, which can affect people’s quality of life. For example, an epiretinal membrane may impair people’s ability to read or drive. \\nIf an epiretinal membrane affects vision, it is commonly removed by surgery. A local anaesthetic (medication) is used to numb the eye area. As with any procedure, this surgery carries risks of harm from side effects. These include potential problems such as cataract, detached retina, infection and bleeding in the eye. \\nTo understand when the benefits of surgery outweigh its risks, we reviewed the research evidence. \\nHow did we identify and evaluate the evidence?First, we searched the medical literature for studies: \\n‐ in which epiretinal membrane was not caused by a pre‐existing condition or surgery;\\n‐ that compared the effects of surgery against no surgery or a placebo (sham) procedure; and \\n‐ where people were randomly assigned to one of two groups: a group that underwent surgery for epiretinal membrane, and a group that did not have surgery for epiretinal membrane. \\nWe then summarised the evidence and rated our confidence in it, based on factors such as study methods and size. \\nWhat did we find?We found only one study that met our criteria. This study took place in Denmark and included 53 people who had epiretinal membranes causing mild impairment of sight. Participants were randomly assigned to one of two groups. Those in one group had immediate surgery. Those in the other group were watched closely and in the event of any deterioration in their condition were invited to have surgery. People in both groups were followed up for one year. \\nThe study results suggest that immediate surgery for epiretinal membrane causing mild impairment of sight: \\n‐ may not benefit vision 12 months after surgery; and\\n‐ may not lead to serious unwanted effects. One person treated with immediate surgery experienced an unwanted effect that was not considered serious. This was the development of an eye condition caused by fluid building up at the back of the eye. \\nThe study did not investigate the impact of surgery on participants’ quality of life.\\nHow confident are we in the evidence?We are not confident in the evidence, because: \\n‐ it is based on one small study; and\\n‐ some of the methods used by the researchers who conducted it may have introduced errors in its results. \\nWhat does this mean?For epiretinal membrane causing severe disabling impairment of sight, we found no carefully‐controlled study that measured the effect of surgery. For severe epiretinal membrane, surgery is widely considered to improve the outcome and is routine practice. A carefully controlled trial comparing surgery to no treatment is considered unecessary and ethically inappropriate. \\nFor epiretinal membrane causing mild impairment of sight, however, the effect of surgery is uncertain. There is some evidence that the outcome of watchful waiting may be as good as the effect of immediate surgery. However, the evidence is not strong enough to draw firm conclusions. Further studies that use robust methods and measure outcomes including quality of life in the longer term would help to determine effect of surgery with more confidence. \\nHow up‐to‐date is this review?The evidence in this Cochrane Review is current to May 2020. \\n\", '10.1002-14651858.CD013268.pub2-pls.txt': 'Statins for asthma\\nReview question \\nWe reviewed the evidence about the effect of statins in people with asthma.\\nBackground \\nAsthma is a common chronic (persistent) airway disease. Asthma is caused by inflammation in the lungs and bronchoconstriction (tightening of the small tubes in the lungs in response to a trigger such as pollen or cold air). Inflammation and bronchoconstriction cause airflow obstruction (narrowing and blockage). People with asthma experience recurrent attacks of wheezing, difficultly in breathing, and chest tightness, with or without a cough. \\nStatins are anti‐inflammatory medicines. We wanted to review the evidence for statins because the theory is that their anti‐inflammatory properties will help people with asthma. We wanted to discover whether using statin therapy was better or worse than other alternatives, such as usual care alone or different types of statins (atorvastatin, simvastatin). \\nStudy characteristics \\nWe found only one trial that assessed atorvastatin (a type of statin drug) and placebo (dummy treatment) in 60 adults with asthma over a period of 12 weeks. These people had chronic asthma (persistent airway disease) when they started treatment. \\nKey results \\nWe found that the statin (atorvastatin) did not result in any clear improvement in lung function in people with asthma, but may be better in asthma control than the dummy drug. However, because there is only one trial, we cannot draw firm conclusions. \\nThe trial did not report on adverse effects or severe adverse effects (harms). We are uncertain whether statins may \\xa0have beneficial effects on relieving asthma or whether they may increase the risk of adverse events or non‐serious adverse events. \\nQuality of the evidence \\nThe evidence was of very low certainty, so we cannot draw firm conclusions about whether statins are helpful and safe to be used by people with asthma. \\nThe evidence is current to 7 February 2020.\\n', '10.1002-14651858.CD013469.pub2-pls.txt': \"Surgical and medical interventions for abdominal aortic graft infections\\nBackground \\nAbdominal aortic graft infections are a serious complication following aortic aneurysm surgery. They can be managed in two ways: either with surgery or medical management. Surgery is currently the mainstay of treatment and is usually performed by two methods, one of which involves removing and replacing the infected graft, and the other bypassing the infected graft. Medical management commonly involves a long‐term course of antibiotics. Medical management avoids the risk of potential complications of surgery, but requires use of antibiotics for several months, or even lifelong. There is currently no agreement on which intervention (surgical or medical) is the most effective in managing abdominal aortic graft infections. In emergency or complex situations such as graft rupture, surgical management is the only option, whilst for those unfit for surgery, medical management is the preferred option. However, in non‐emergency situations, it is often personal preference that influences the healthcare provider's decision‐making. This review aimed to assess and compare the effects of surgical and medical interventions for abdominal aortic graft infections. \\nStudy characteristics and key results \\nWe searched for randomised controlled trials (a type of study in which participants are assigned to one of two or more treatment groups using a random method) to December 2019. We found no trials that met our inclusion criteria. Hence there is currently insufficient evidence to draw conclusions relating to the effects of surgical and medical interventions for abdominal aortic graft infections. \\nConclusion \\nMulticentre randomised controlled trials are required to identify the most effective method of treating aortic graft infection. By doing this, 'gold standard' guidelines can be formulated so that all patients can receive the same level of treatment without regard for where they are being treated. \\n\", '10.1002-14651858.CD013837.pub2-pls.txt': \"Antibiotic regimens for early‐onset neonatal sepsis\\nReview question \\nWe reviewed available evidence on different antibiotic regimens for newborns (from birth to 72 hours of life), with early‐onset sepsis (as defined by trialists). \\nBackground \\nSepsis in newborns is a severe and potential lethal condition, caused by the body's response to an infection. Neonatal sepsis is the third leading cause of neonatal death globally. Despite the high burden of sepsis in newborns, high‐quality evidence in diagnosis and treatment is scarce. This Cochrane Review was originally published in 2004. To identify the most appropriate antibiotic policies for neonatal sepsis, there is a need to base these policies on an updated well‐conducted review. Given the clinical importance, such a review assessing the effects of different antibiotic regimens for early‐onset neonatal sepsis is needed. \\nStudy characteristics \\nThe evidence is current to August 2020. We included five trials randomising 865 participants. The included trials compared five different antibiotic regimens. \\nKey results \\nWe included five trials:\\xa0one trial compared ampicillin plus gentamicin with benzylpenicillin plus gentamicin; one trial compared piperacillin plus tazobactam with amikacin; one trial compared ticarcillin plus clavulanic acid with piperacillin plus gentamicin; one trial compared piperacillin with ampicillin plus amikacin; and one trial compared ceftazidime with benzylpenicillin plus gentamicin. \\nNone of the five comparisons showed any difference when assessing death from all causes, serious adverse events (i.e. major complications), respiratory support, circulatory support, nephrotoxicity (toxicity in the kidneys), neurological developmental impairment (disabilities in the functioning of the brain that affect a child's behaviour, memory, or ability to learn), necrotising enterocolitis (tissues in the gut become inflamed and start to die), or ototoxicity (toxic to the ear). Current evidence cannot confirm or reject one antibiotic regimen being superior to another. \\nQuality of the evidence \\nThe evidence behind our conclusions is very‐low quality. The five trials had high risk of bias (i.e. the trials were conducted in a way that may have skewed results to the positive side). In addition, the five trials included few participants, making the results of this review imprecise. \\n\", '10.1002-14651858.CD011960.pub2-abstract.txt': \"Treatment with all‐trans retinoic acid in addition to chemotherapy for adult patients with acute myeloid leukaemia (non‐APL) \\nWhat is the aim of this review? \\nThis review aims to determine benefits and harms of all‐trans retinoic acid (ATRA) in addition to chemotherapy compared with chemotherapy alone for adults with AML. We did not evaluate participants with acute promyelocytic leukaemia (APL). We collected and analysed all relevant studies to answer this question and found eight studies. \\nKey messages \\nThe addition of ATRA to chemotherapy did not show relevant differences in terms of overall survival (OS), but the subgroup analyses showed that there is potential benefit for ATRA in combination with a certain chemotherapeutic called decitabine , for older patients (over 60 years) and for patients who already had successful chemotherapy and now receive therapy for maintenance. We assessed the certainty of evidence as moderate for OS, disease‐free‐survival and on‐study mortality. \\nRates of toxicities were low, therefore certainty of evidence is 'very low' to 'low' for the adverse events diarrhoea, nausea/vomiting and cardiac toxicity. For the adverse event infection, we judged the certainty of evidence as moderate. Currently, it seems the risk of adverse events with additional ATRA are comparable to chemotherapy only. \\nQuality of life was not reported by any of the included trials.\\nWhat was studied in this review? \\nAcute myeloid leukaemia is a life‐threatening type of cancer that starts in the blood‐forming cells of the bone marrow and can cause many different signs and symptoms. It is classified into several subtypes, of which one subtype, acute promyelocytic leukaemia (APL) is treated differently to the other subtypes. \\nAlmost 60% of patients are older than 65 years at the time of diagnosis. Because of advanced age and accompanying diseases an intensive therapy with high‐dose chemotherapy and stem cell transplantation often is not possible or is accompanied by high risks for serious adverse events and treatment‐related mortality. For these reasons it would be important to know a less intensive and dangerous therapy for older patients. \\nAll‐trans retinoic acid (ATRA), an intermediate product of vitamin A, had been integrated into treatment regimens for APL by the end of the 1980s. It is administered orally and is generally well tolerated but can induce a severe, life‐threatening complication called differentiation syndrome, which includes breathing difficulties and fever. \\nThe literature provides contradictory data about the benefit of ATRA for patients with AML. It has been reported to increase the sensitivity of AML cell lines to chemotherapy by reducing one protein, which is associated with poor response to chemotherapy and therefore is related to a poor prognosis.These reports have led to the assumption that ATRA added to chemotherapy may improve outcomes and might replace or reduce the intensity of chemotherapy for patients with AML. \\nWhat are the main results of this review? \\nWe found eight relevant studies with almost 4000 patients in total, conducted in the UK, Germany and France. These studies compared chemotherapy in combination with ATRA with chemotherapy alone in adult patients (over 18 years) with AML. All the included trials used different chemotherapy schedules, as there are several types of chemotherapy regimens for AML. Only in one trial did participants receive a newer drug, decitabine, which has been licensed for the treatment of AML since 2012. \\nAdding ATRA to chemotherapy probably makes little or no difference to OS. ATRA may be potentially beneficial in combination with decitabine, for older patients (over 60 years) and for patients who receive therapy for maintenance, but these findings need to be explored by further research. \\nFor disease‐free‐survival, complete response rate and on‐study mortality there was probably no or little difference between treatment groups. \\nThe combination of ATRA probably did not lead to a higher infection rate. Regarding cardiac toxicity and diarrhoea, the certainty of the evidence was assessed as very low, so we are uncertain whether the addition of ATRA is beneficial. \\nQuality of life was not reported by any of the included trials.\\nHow up‐to‐date is this review? \\nWe searched for studies that had been published up to July 2018.\\n\", '10.1002-14651858.CD013186-pls.txt': 'What is the diagnostic accuracy of computer‐assisted diagnosis techniques for the detection of skin cancer in adults? \\nWhy is improving the diagnosis of skin cancer important? \\nThere are a number of different types of skin cancer, including melanoma, squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and basal cell carcinoma (BCC). Melanoma is one of the most dangerous forms. If it is not recognised early treatment can be delayed and this risks the melanoma spreading to other organs in the body and may eventually lead to death. Cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC) and BCC are considered less dangerous, as they are localised (less likely to spread to other parts of the body compared to melanoma). However, cSCC can spread to other parts of the body and BCC can cause disfigurement if not recognised early. Diagnosing a skin cancer when it is not actually present (a false‐positive result) might result in unnecessary surgery and other investigations and can cause stress and anxiety to the patient. Missing a diagnosis of skin cancer may result in the wrong treatment being used or lead to a delay in effective treatment. \\nWhat is the aim of the review? \\nThe aim of this Cochrane Review was to find out how accurate computer–assisted diagnosis (CAD) is for diagnosing melanoma, BCC or cSCC. The review also compared the accuracy of two different types of CAD, and compared the accuracy of CAD with diagnosis by a doctor using a handheld illuminated microscope (a dermatoscope or ‘dermoscopy’). We included 42 studies to answer these questions. \\nWhat was studied in the review? \\nA number of tools are available to skin cancer specialists which allow a more detailed examination of the skin compared to examination by the naked eye alone. Currently a dermatoscope which magnifies the skin lesion (a mole or area of skin with an unusual appearance in comparison with the surrounding skin) using a bright light source is used by most skin cancer specialists. CAD tests are computer systems that analyse information about skin lesions obtained from a dermatoscope or other techniques that use light to describe the features of a skin lesion (spectroscopy) to produce a result indicating whether skin cancer is likely to be present. We included CAD systems that get their information from dermoscopic images of lesions (Derm–CAD), or that use data from spectroscopy. Most of the spectroscopy studies used data from multispectral imaging (MSI–CAD) and are the main focus here. When a skin cancer specialist finds a lesion is suspicious using visual examination with or without additional dermoscopy, results from CAD systems can be used alone to make a diagnosis of skin cancer (CAD–based diagnosis), or can be used by doctors in addition to their visual inspection examination of a skin lesion to help them reach a diagnosis (CAD–aided diagnosis). Researchers examined how useful CAD systems are to help diagnose skin cancers in addition to visual inspection and dermoscopy. \\nWhat are the main results of the review? \\nThe review included 42 studies looking at CAD systems for the diagnosis of melanoma. There was not enough evidence to determine the accuracy of CAD systems for the diagnosis of BCC (3 studies) or cSCC (1 study). \\nDerm‐CAD results for diagnosis of melanoma  \\nThe main results for Derm‐CAD are based on 22 studies including 8992 lesions.\\nApplied to a group of 1000 skin lesions, of which 200 (20%) are given a final diagnosis* of melanoma, the results suggest that: \\n‐ An estimated 386 people will have a Derm–CAD result suggesting that a melanoma is present, and of these 206 (53%) will not actually have a melanoma (false‐positive result) \\n‐ Of the 614 people with a Derm–CAD result indicating that no melanoma is present, 20 (3%) will in fact actually have a melanoma (false‐negative result) \\nThere was no evidence to suggest that dermoscopy or Derm–CAD was different in its ability to detect or rule out melanoma. \\nMSI‐CAD results for diagnosis of melanoma  \\nThe main results for MSI–CAD are based on eight studies including 2401 lesions. In a group of 1000 people, of whom 200 (20%) actually do have melanoma*, then: \\n‐ An estimated 637 people will have an MSI–CAD result suggesting that a melanoma is present, and of these 451 (71%) will not actually have a melanoma (false‐positive result) \\n‐ Of the 363 people with an MSI–CAD result indicating that no melanoma is present, 14 (4%) will in fact have a melanoma (false‐negative result) \\nMSI–CAD detects more melanomas, but possibly produces more false‐positive results (an increase in unnecessary surgery). \\nHow reliable are the results of the studies of this review? \\nIncomplete reporting of studies made it difficult for us to judge how reliable they were. Many studies had important limitations. Some studies only included particular types of skin lesions or excluded lesions that were considered difficult to diagnose. Importantly, most of the studies only included skin lesions with a biopsy result, which means that only a sample of lesions that would be seen by a doctor in practice were included. These characteristics may result in CAD systems appearing more or less accurate than they actually are. \\nWho do the results of this review apply to? \\nStudies were largely conducted in Europe (29, 69%) and North America (8, 19%). Mean age (reported in 6/42 studies) ranged from 32 to 49 years for melanoma. The percentage of people with a final diagnosis of melanoma ranged from 1% to 52%. It was not always possible to tell whether suspicion of skin cancer in study participants was based on clinical examination alone, or both clinical and dermoscopic examinations. Almost all studies were done in people with skin lesions who were seen at specialist clinics rather than by doctors in primary care. \\nWhat are the implications of this review? \\nCAD systems appear to be accurate for identification of melanomas in skin lesions that have already been selected for excision on the basis of clinical examination (visual inspection and dermoscopy). It is possible that some CAD systems identify more melanomas than doctors using dermoscopy images. However, CAD systems also produced far more false‐positive diagnoses than dermoscopy, and could lead to considerable increases in unnecessary surgery. The performance of CAD systems for detecting BCC and cSCC skin cancers is unclear. More studies are needed to evaluate the use of CAD by doctors for the diagnosis of skin cancer in comparison to face‐to‐face diagnosis using dermoscopy, both in primary care and in specialist skin cancer clinics. \\nHow up‐to‐date is this review? \\nThe review authors searched for and used studies published up to August 2016.\\n*In these studies, biopsy, clinical follow up, or specialist clinician diagnosis were the reference standards (means of establishing the final diagnosis). \\n', '10.1002-14651858.CD007565.pub2-abstract.txt': \"Clear survival benefit is achieved if all or most (< 1 cm remaining) of the tumour after primary surgical treatment for advanced epithelial ovarian cancer is removed \\nOvarian cancer is a cancerous growth arising from different parts of the ovary. It is the sixth most common cancer among women. Most ovarian cancers are classified as epithelial. Ovarian epithelial cancer is a disease in which malignant (cancer) cells form in the tissue covering the ovary and most cases are epithelial. Primary surgery is performed to achieve optimal cytoreduction (surgical efforts aiming at removing the bulk of the tumour) as the amount of tumour that remains after surgery (residual disease) is one of the most important factors that is taken into account when determining a prognosis (prognostic factor) for survival of epithelial ovarian cancer. Optimal cytoreductive surgery remains a subject of controversy to many practising obstetric gynaecologists who specialise in the diagnosis and treatment of women with cancer of the reproductive organs (gynae‐oncologists). The Gynaecologic Oncology Group (GOG) currently defines 'optimal' as having a small aggregation of remaining cancer cells after surgery (residual tumour nodules) each measuring 1 cm or less in maximum diameter, with complete cytoreduction (microscopic disease) being the ideal surgical outcome. Although the size of residual tumour masses after surgery has been shown to be an important prognostic factor for advanced ovarian cancer, there is limited evidence to support the conclusion that the surgical procedure is directly responsible for the superior outcome associated with less residual disease. This review assessed overall and progression‐free survival of optimal primary cytoreductive surgery for women with advanced epithelial ovarian cancer (stages III and IV). We found 11 retrospective studies that included more than 100 women and used a multivariate analysis (used statistical adjustment for important prognostic factors) and met our inclusion criteria. Analyses showed the prognostic importance of complete cytoreduction, where the residual disease is microscopic with no visible disease, as overall (OS) and progression‐free survival (PFS) were significantly prolonged in these groups of women. PFS was not reported in all of the studies but was sufficiently documented to allow firm conclusions to be drawn. When we compared suboptimal (> 1 cm) versus optimal (< 1 cm) cytoreduction the survival estimates were attenuated but remained statistically significant in favour of the lower volume disease group, but there was no significant difference in OS and only a borderline difference in PFS when residual disease of > 2 cm and < 2 cm were compared. There was a high risk of bias due to the retrospective nature of these studies. Adverse events, quality of life (QoL) and cost‐effectiveness were not reported by treatment arm or to a satisfactory level in any of the studies. During primary surgery for advanced stage epithelial ovarian cancer, all attempts should be made to achieve complete cytoreduction. When this is not achievable, the surgical goal should be optimal (< 1 cm) residual disease. Due to the high risk of bias in the current evidence, randomised controlled trials should be performed to determine whether it is the surgical intervention or patient‐related and disease‐related factors that are associated with the improved survival in these groups of women. \\n\", '10.1002-14651858.CD013705.pub3-pls.txt': 'How accurate are rapid antigen tests for diagnosing COVID‐19?\\nKey messages \\n• Rapid antigen tests are most accurate when they are used in people who have signs or symptoms of COVID‐19, especially during the first week of illness. People who test negative may still be infected. \\n• Rapid antigen tests are considerably less accurate when they are used in people with no signs or symptoms of infection, but do perform better in people who have been in contact with someone who has confirmed COVID‐19. \\n• The accuracy of rapid antigen tests varies between tests that are produced by different manufacturers and there is a lack of evidence for many commercially available tests. \\nWhat are rapid point‐of‐care antigen tests for COVID‐19? \\nRapid point‐of‐care tests aim to confirm or rule out COVID‐19 infection in people with or without COVID‐19 symptoms. They: \\n• are portable, so they can be used wherever the patient is (at the point‐of‐care) or in non‐healthcare settings such as in the home; \\n• are easy to perform, with a minimum amount of extra equipment or complicated preparation steps; \\n• are less expensive than standard laboratory tests;\\n• do not require a specialist operator or setting; and\\n• provide results ‘while you wait’.\\nFor this review we were interested in rapid antigen tests, sometimes referred to as ‘lateral flow tests’. These tests identify proteins on the virus in samples taken from the nose or throat. They come in disposable plastic cassettes, similar to over‐the‐counter pregnancy tests. \\nWhy is this question important? \\nPeople with suspected COVID‐19 need to know quickly whether they are infected, so that they can self‐isolate, receive treatment, and inform close contacts. Currently, COVID‐19 infection is confirmed by a laboratory test called RT‐PCR, which uses specialist equipment and often takes at least 24 hours to produce a result. \\nIn many places, rapid antigen tests have opened access to testing for many more people, with and without symptoms, and in locations other than healthcare settings. Faster diagnosis of COVID‐19 infection could allow people to take appropriate action more quickly, with the potential to reduce the spread of COVID‐19, but it is important to understand how accurate they are and the best way to use them. \\nWhat did we want to find out? \\nWe wanted to know whether commercially available, rapid point‐of‐care antigen tests are accurate enough to diagnose COVID‐19 infection reliably, and to find out if accuracy differs in people with and without symptoms. \\nWhat did we do? \\nWe looked for studies that measured the accuracy of any commercially produced rapid antigen test in people who were also tested for COVID‐19 using RT‐PCR. People could be tested in hospital, in the community or in their own homes. Studies could test people with or without symptoms. \\nWhat did we find? \\nWe included 155 studies in the review. The main results are based on 152 studies investigating a total of 100,462 nose or throat samples; COVID‐19 was confirmed in 16,822 of these samples. Studies investigated 49 different antigen tests. Around 60% of studies took place in Europe. \\nMain results \\nIn people with confirmed COVID‐19, antigen tests correctly identified COVID‐19 infection in an average of 73% of people with symptoms, compared to 55% of people without symptoms. Tests were most accurate when used in the first week after symptoms began (an average of 82% of confirmed cases had positive antigen tests). This is likely to be because people have the most virus in their system in the first days after they are infected. For people with no symptoms, tests were most accurate in people likely to have been in contact with a case of COVID‐19 infection (an average of 64% of confirmed cases had positive antigen tests). \\nIn people who did not have COVID‐19, antigen tests correctly ruled out infection in 99.6% of people with symptoms and 99.7% of people without symptoms. \\nDifferent brands of tests varied in accuracy. Summary results (combined from more than one study per test brand) for seven tests met World Health Organization (WHO) standards as ‘acceptable’ for confirming and ruling out COVID‐19 in people with signs and symptoms of COVID‐19. Two more tests met the WHO acceptable standard in one study each. No test met this standard when evaluated in people without symptoms. \\nUsing summary results for symptomatic people tested during the first week after symptoms began, if 1000 people with symptoms had the antigen test, and 50 (5%) of them really had COVID‐19: \\n• 45 people would test positive for COVID‐19. Of these, 5 people (11%) would not have COVID‐19 (false positive result). \\n• 955 people would test negative for COVID‐19. Of these, 10 people (1.0%) would actually have COVID‐19 (false negative result). \\nIn people with no symptoms of COVID‐19 the number of confirmed cases is expected to be much lower than in people with symptoms. Using summary results for people with no known exposure to COVID‐19 in a bigger population of 10,000 people with no symptoms, where 50 (0.5%) of them really had COVID‐19: \\n• 62 people would test positive for COVID‐19. Of these, 30 people (48%) would not have COVID‐19 (false positive result). \\n• 9938 people would test negative for COVID‐19. Of these, 18 people (0.2%) would actually have COVID‐19 (false negative result). \\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence? \\nIn general, studies used relatively rigorous methods, particularly for selecting participants and performing the tests. Sometimes studies did not perform the test on the people for whom it was intended and did not follow the manufacturers’ instructions for using the test. Sometimes the tests were not carried out at the point of care. Studies used less rigorous methods for confirming the presence or absence of COVID‐19 infection; 91% of studies relied on a single negative RT‐PCR result as evidence of no COVID‐19 infection. Results from different test brands varied, and relatively few studies directly compared one test brand with another. Finally, not all studies gave enough information about their participants for us to judge how long they had had symptoms, or even whether or not they had symptoms. \\nWhat does this mean? \\nIn people with symptoms, some rapid antigen tests are accurate enough to replace RT‐PCR, especially for ruling in the presence of infection. Alternatively, where RT‐PCR is available, rapid antigen tests could be used to select which people with symptoms require further testing with RT‐PCR, thereby reducing the burden on laboratory services. This would be most useful when quick decisions are needed about patient care, to identify outbreaks, to allow people to self‐isolate more quickly, or to initiate contact tracing. Rapid antigen tests are less good at ruling out infection in symptomatic people ‐ individuals who receive a negative rapid antigen test result may still be infected. \\nRapid antigen tests are less accurate when used in people with no symptoms of COVID‐19. More evidence is needed to understand the accuracy of rapid testing in people without symptoms and the extent to which repeated testing strategies can lead to reduced transmission, either for tests carried out at home or in non‐healthcare settings such as schools. There is no independent evidence to support the use of many test brands. More direct comparisons of test brands are needed, with testers following manufacturers’ instructions. \\nHow up‐to‐date is this review? \\nThis review updates our previous review and includes evidence published up to 8 March 2021. \\n', '10.1002-14651858.CD014484-pls.txt': 'Low‐dose misoprostol given by mouth for induction of labour\\nWe looked at the evidence from randomised controlled trials to see if low‐dose misoprostol given by mouth is effective in starting labour in women in their third trimester with a live baby. We compared misoprostol with other commonly used methods of inducing labour. \\nWhat is the issue? \\nArtificially starting labour, or induction, is common in pregnancy. Reasons include the mother having high blood pressure in pregnancy or the baby being past the due date. Misoprostol is a type of prostaglandin that can be taken in low doses by mouth to induce labour. Prostaglandins are hormone‐like compounds that are made by the body for various functions (including the natural onset of labour). Unlike other prostaglandins such as vaginal dinoprostone, misoprostol\\xa0does not need to be stored in the refrigerator. Taking a tablet is convenient to mothers and the low‐dose tablet sizes are now available (25 µg).\\xa0 \\nWhy is this important? \\nA good induction method achieves a safe birth for mother and baby. It is effective, results in a relatively low number of caesarean sections, has few side effects, and is highly acceptable to mothers. Some methods of inducing labour may cause more caesarean sections by being ineffective at bringing on labour, other methods may lead to more caesareans as they cause too many contractions (hyperstimulation) that result in the baby becoming distressed (foetal heart rate changes). \\nWhat evidence did we find? \\nWe searched for evidence on 14 February 2021\\xa0and identified 61 trials involving 20,026 women\\xa0for inclusion in this review. Not all trials were high quality. \\nStarting with oral misoprostol immediately may have a similar effect on rates of caesarean section (4 trials, 594 women; low‐certainty evidence) to giving no treatment for 12 to 24 hours then starting oxytocin, while the effects of misoprostol on uterine hyperstimulation with foetal heart rate changes are unclear (3 trials, 495 women; very low‐quality evidence). All women in theses trials had ruptured membranes. \\nOral misoprostol was compared\\xa0to vaginal dinoprostone in 13 trials (9676 women). Misoprostol use probably decreased the risk of caesarean section (moderate‐certainty evidence). When studies were divided by their initial dose of misoprostol, there was evidence that use of 10 µg to 25 µg may be effective in reducing the risk of a caesarean section (9 trials, 8652 women), while the higher 50 µg dose might not reduce the risk (4 trials, 1024 women). There may be very small or no differences between misoprostol and dinoprostone in rates of vaginal births within 24 hours (10 trials, 8983 women; low‐certainty evidence) but may be fewer cases of hyperstimulation with foetal heart rate changes with oral misoprostol (11 trials, 9084 women; low‐certainty evidence).\\xa0 \\nOral misoprostol was compared with vaginal misoprostol in 33 trials (6110 women). Oral use may have resulted in fewer vaginal births within 24 hours (16 trials, 3451 women; low‐certainty evidence). Oral use may have caused less hyperstimulation with foetal heart rate changes (25 trials, 4857 women; low‐certainty evidence), especially with a dose of 10 µg to 25 µg. There was no clear difference in the number of caesarean sections overall (32 trials, 5914 women; low‐certainty evidence) but oral use likely resulted in fewer caesareans being performed because of concerns of the baby being in distress (24 trials, 4775 women). \\nWhen oral misoprostol was compared to oxytocin for induction, misoprostol use probably resulted in fewer caesarean sections (6 trials, 737 women). We found no clear difference in vaginal birth within 24 hours (3 trials, 466 women; moderate‐certainty evidence) or hyperstimulation with foetal heart rate changes (3 trials, 331 women; very low‐certainty evidence). \\nOral misoprostol was compared to a balloon catheter inserted in the cervix to mechanically induce labour. The number of vaginal births within 24 hours may have increased with misoprostol (4 trials, 1044 women; low‐certainty evidence). Misoprostol probably reduced the risk of caesarean section (6 trials, 2993 women; moderate‐certainty evidence) with no difference in risk of hyperstimulation with foetal heart rate changes (4 trials, 1044 women; low‐certainty evidence). \\nDifferent doses and timings of giving oral misoprostol were explored in three small trials. The certainty of the findings from these trials was either low\\xa0or very low\\xa0so we cannot draw any meaningful conclusions from this data. \\nWhat does this mean? \\nUsing low‐dose (50 µg or less) oral misoprostol to induce labour likely leads to fewer caesarean sections and so more vaginal births than vaginal dinoprostone, oxytocin, and a transcervical Foley catheter.\\xa0Rates of hyperstimulation with foetal heart rate changes were comparable with these methods. Misoprostol taken by mouth causes less hyperstimulation with foetal heart changes compared to when taken vaginally.\\xa0 \\nMore trials are needed to establish the most effective misoprostol regimen for labour induction, but for now the findings of this review support oral\\xa0rather than vaginal use, and suggest that commencing oral misoprostol at a dose of 25 µg or less may be safe and effective. \\n', '10.1002-14651858.CD014545-pls.txt': \"Dental imaging methods for the detection of early tooth decay\\nWhy is it important to improve the detection of dental caries (tooth decay)? Dentists often aim to identify tooth decay that has already advanced to a level which needs a filling. If dentists were able to find tooth decay when it has only affected the outer layer of the tooth (enamel) then it is possible to stop the decay from spreading any further and prevent the need for fillings. It is also important to avoid a false‐positive result, when treatment may be given when caries is absent. \\nWhat is the aim of this review?This Cochrane Review aimed to find out how accurate X‐ray images and other types of dental imaging are for detecting early tooth decay as part of the dental 'check‐up' for children and adults who visit their general dentist. Researchers in Cochrane included 77 studies published between 1986 and 2018 to answer this question. \\nWhat was studied in the review?Three main types of dental imaging were studied in this review: analogue or digital radiographs (X‐rays) and three‐dimensional (3D) imaging (cone beam computed tomography (CBCT)). We studied decay on the occlusal surfaces (biting surfaces of the back teeth), the proximal surfaces (tooth surfaces that are next to each other), and smooth surfaces. \\nWhat are the main results of the review?Researchers in Cochrane included 77 studies with a total of 15,518 tooth sites or surfaces, where typically 63% of tooth sites or surfaces had enamel caries. Some of these studies reported on more than one type of imaging, on both the permanent and primary ('milk') teeth or different tooth surfaces, and this gave us 104 sets of data to use. If these methods were to be used by a dentist for a routine dental examination, out of 1000 tooth sites or surfaces seen:• the use of these methods will indicate that 336 tooth sites or surfaces will have early tooth decay, and of these, 43 (13%) will have no disease (incorrect diagnosis ‐ false positive);• of the 664 tooth sites with a result indicating that early tooth decay is absent, 337 (51%) will have early tooth decay (incorrect diagnosis ‐ false negative).This high proportion of false‐negative results means that early signs of decay will be missed. We found evidence that 3D imaging methods were better than analogue or digital radiographs at identifying early disease but that analogue radiographs were better at identifying disease‐free tooth surfaces. \\nPlease see oralhealth.cochrane.org/imaging-modalities-inform-detection-and-diagnosis-early-caries. \\nHow reliable are the results of the studies in this review?We only included studies that assessed healthy teeth or those that were thought to have early tooth decay. This is because teeth with deep tooth decay would be easier to identify. However, there were some problems with how the studies were conducted. This may result in these methods appearing more accurate than they are, increasing the number of correct results. We judged the certainty of the evidence to be low due to how the studies selected their participants and the large number of studies that were carried out in a laboratory setting on extracted teeth, and the variation in the results. \\nWho do the results of this review apply to?Studies included in the review were carried out in South America, Europe, Asia, and the US. A large number of studies examined extracted teeth, while clinical studies were completed in dental hospitals or general dental practices. \\nWhat are the implications of this review?Low‐certainty evidence suggests that imaging for the detection or diagnosis of early tooth decay may result in a relatively high proportion of false‐negative results, with the potential for early disease to become more advanced. If left untreated, the opportunity to provide professional or self‐care practices to arrest or reverse early tooth decay will be missed. \\nHow up‐to‐date is this review?The electronic searches retrieved used studies published up to 31 December 2018. \\n\", '10.1002-14651858.CD013732.pub2-pls.txt': \"Opioids for newborns receiving mechanical ventilation\\nReview question \\nDo drugs such as morphine and fentanyl (opioids) save lives, reduce pain, or improve the long‐term development of newborns needing breathing machines (mechanical ventilators)?Background \\nBreathing machines\\xa0are widely used for newborn full‐term (≥ 37 weeks' gestational age) and preterm (< 37 weeks' gestational age) babies with breathing problems.

People with moderately elevated blood glucose are said to be at an increased risk for developing type 2 diabetes (often referred to as 'prediabetes'). It is currently not known whether DPP‐4 inhibitors or GLP‐1 analogues should be prescribed for people with raised blood glucose levels who do not have type 2 diabetes. We wanted to find out whether these medicines could prevent or delay type 2 diabetes in people at increased risk. We also wanted to know the effects on patient‐important outcomes such as complications of diabetes (e.g. kidney and eye disease, heart attacks, strokes), death from any cause, health‐related quality of life (a measure of a person's satisfaction with their life and health) and side effects of the medicines. \\nStudy characteristics \\nParticipants had to have blood glucose levels higher than considered normal, but below the glucose levels that are used to diagnose type 2 diabetes mellitus. We found seven randomised controlled trials (clinical studies where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups) with 2702 participants. The duration of the treatments varied from 12 weeks to 160 weeks. One study investigating liraglutide dominated the evidence (2285/2702 participants). The participants in this study were overweight or obese. \\nThis evidence is up to date as of January 2017.\\nKey results \\nDPP‐4 inhibitors did not reduce the risk of developing type 2 diabetes compared with placebo (a dummy medicine). In the big study investigating the GLP‐1‐analogue liraglutide, given in a dose used for obese people (3.0 mg), the development of type 2 diabetes was delayed: 26/1472 (1.8%) participants randomised to liraglutide compared with 46/738 (6.2%) participants randomised to placebo developed type 2 diabetes after 160 weeks. On the other side, 970/1472 (66%) participants randomised to liraglutide compared with 268/738 (36%) participants randomised to placebo switched back to normal glucose levels. This study was extended for another 12 weeks without treatment and five additional participants developed diabetes in the liraglutide group, compared with one participant in the placebo group. After the 12 weeks without treatment, 740/1472 (50%) participants in the liraglutide group compared with 263/738 (36%) participants in the placebo group had glucose levels considered as normal. This means that to keep chances high to prevent type 2 diabetes in people at risk one probably needs to continuously take this drug. Of note, serious adverse events (e.g. defined as hospitalisation or a hazard putting the participant at risk, such as an interaction with another medicine) happened more often following liraglutide treatment (230/1524 (15%) participants in the liraglutide group and 96/755 (13%) participants in the placebo group) and it is unclear whether taking this drug is safe in the long term. \\nWe detected neither an advantage nor a disadvantage of DPP‐4 inhibitors or GLP‐1 analogues in relation to non‐fatal heart attacks, non‐fatal strokes or heart failure. Our included studies did not report on other complications of diabetes such as kidney or eye disease. The effects on health‐related quality of life were inconclusive. In the included studies, very few participants died and there was no apparent relation to treatment. \\nFuture studies should investigate more patient‐important outcomes like complications of diabetes and especially the side effects of the medications, because we do not know for sure whether 'prediabetes' is just a condition arbitrarily defined by a laboratory measurement, is in fact a real risk factor for type 2 diabetes mellitus and whether treatment of this condition translates into better patient‐important outcomes. \\nQuality of the evidence \\nAll included trials had deficiencies in the way they were conducted or how key items were reported. For the individual comparisons, the number of participants was small, resulting in a high risk of random errors (play of chance). \\n\", '10.1002-14651858.CD013381.pub2-pls.txt': 'Which approaches help people with COPD to maintain taking medication as prescribed?\\nReview question \\nWhich approaches help people maintain taking prescribed medication(s), improve quality of life and reduce hospital admissions in people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)? \\nBackground \\nCOPD is a lung condition that can cause long‐term breathing problems and includes symptoms such as shortness of breath. Medications do exist that can help but sometimes people do not take them as prescribed. Different approaches could help people to take their medication as prescribed and help improve symptoms or quality of life and reduce hospital admissions. \\nWe wanted to find out if any approaches could help people with COPD take their medication(s) as prescribed. \\nStudies identified and selected \\nWe searched databases to find the studies. Four people working in pairs looked at the lists of studies separately and agreed on which ones were included. The latest search for studies was conducted in May 2020. \\nStudy characteristics \\nWe included studies comparing simple ways to help improve medication use (e.g. different medication doses or single inhalers instead of two separate inhalers) to usual COPD care. We also included studies that tested combination approaches (e.g. information or training from nurses or pharmacists and monitoring medication use). \\nWhat were the key results? \\nWe included 14 studies (2191 people) in our analysis. No studies were masked (people knew whether they were receiving an approach to help them with adherence or the alternative). Six studies used simple approaches (e.g. change to medication dosage, change to type of inhaler, or a Bluetooth inhaler reminder device), and eight studies used combined approaches (e.g. nurses or pharmacists giving advice or information about how to improve medication use). \\nWe were uncertain about the effects of a different medication dose on people adhering to medication because it was no different to usual care (one study). Two separate studies found that a Bluetooth inhaler reminder device or a change in oral medication dose did not help to improve adherence. Health professionals involved in giving information may help to improve adherence (one study). This was measured by prescription refills. Motivating people to change their behaviour could help to improve adherence their medication (one study). This was measured by people completing a questionnaire about adherence to their medication. \\nOne study found that a Bluetooth inhaler device might help to improve quality of life. There may be little to no difference between those using single inhalers in the number of people admitted to hospital compared to those using two separate inhalers (one study). We found no difference between single approaches and usual care on the number of people who had side effects. \\nCombined approaches may help to improve the number of people taking their medication, but we were not confident of this finding (four studies). They may have little to no impact on quality of life (three studies). Combined approaches could be beneficial in reducing the number of people with COPD admitted to hospital for any reason or because of COPD symptoms (two studies). \\nThere was no difference between combined approaches and in the number of people who had adverse events. \\nTake home message \\nWe could not say for certain that simple approaches are useful to help people with COPD to improve medication use because of very limited information. Combined approaches may help people to take their medication(s) as prescribed and can help to reduce the number of people admitted to hospital, however, more information is needed to help answer this question with confidence. \\n', '10.1002-14651858.CD007726.pub3-abstract.txt': 'Stopping or continuing long‐term antipsychotic drug use for behavioural and psychological symptoms in older people with dementia \\nReview question \\nWe investigated the effects of stopping antipsychotic drugs in older people with dementia who had been taking them for three months or longer. \\nBackground \\nPeople with dementia may have symptoms and behavioural problems that can be distressing and difficult for carers to manage. Such symptoms (often described as neuropsychiatric symptoms, or NPS) include anxiety, apathy, depression, psychosis (hallucinations and delusions), wandering, repeating words or sounds, shouting, and behaving in agitated or aggressive ways, or both. \\nAntipsychotic drugs are often prescribed with the aim of controlling these symptoms and behaviours, although most current guidance suggests these drugs should only be used for short periods of time for the most challenging behaviours. This is largely because these drugs are thought to have risks of side effects (including some that are serious), and because many behavioural problems improve without treatment. However, many people with dementia continue to take antipsychotic drugs over long periods of time. \\nThis review investigated whether it is feasible for older people with dementia and NPS to stop antipsychotic drugs which they have been taking for at least three months. This is an update of a Cochrane Review published in 2013. \\nMethods \\nWe searched up to 11 January 2018 for any study that randomly allocated some people with dementia who were taking antipsychotic drugs to continue this treatment and others to stop taking antipsychotic drugs. Study participants were followed up over a period of time to see what happened. \\nResults \\nWe included 10 studies with a total of 632 participants in our review. We added one new study with 19 participants for this update. Most participants lived in nursing homes. The studies varied considerably with regard to the people they included, the methods they used and the outcomes they measured. \\nBecause the studies were so diverse, it was not possible to combine all the data numerically. We found low‐quality evidence that older people with dementia may be able to stop long‐term antipsychotics without their behavioural problems getting worse. However, in some people who had psychosis, agitation or aggression and who had improved significantly when they first started antipsychotic treatment, we found that stopping the drugs may increase the risk of the behavioural problems getting worse again. On the other hand, agitation decreased after stopping the drugs in some participants whose NPS at the beginning of the studies was relatively mild. \\nWe did not find enough evidence to know whether stopping antipsychotics has beneficial effects on quality of life, thinking and remembering, or the ability to carry out daily tasks, nor if the risk of harmful events ‐ such as falls ‐ is reduced. We are uncertain whether stopping antipsychotics leads to people living longer. \\nQuality of the evidence \\nOverall, evidence was low‐ or very low‐quality. This means we have limited or little confidence in the results, and that it is possible that other similar research could find something different. The main reasons for this assessment were that there were few studies that included few people, and a risk that results were not fully reported. All included studies had problems recruiting enough participants, making it more difficult for them to detect effects of stopping antipsychotics. \\nConclusions \\nLimited evidence suggests that stopping long‐term antipsychotic drug use in older people with dementia and NPS may be done without making their behaviour worse. There may be benefits especially for those with milder NPS. There may be people with more severe symptoms who benefit from continuing treatment, but more research in people with both milder and more severe NPS is needed to be sure about this. The overall conclusions have not changed since the last version of this review and the number of included trials is still low. \\n', '10.1002-14651858.CD010789.pub2-abstract.txt': 'Whole‐body cryotherapy for preventing and treating muscle soreness after exercise\\nBackground and aim of the review \\nDelayed onset muscle soreness describes the muscular pain, tenderness and stiffness experienced after high‐intensity or unaccustomed exercise. Various therapies are in use to prevent or reduce muscle soreness after exercise and to enhance recovery. One more recent therapy that is growing in use is whole‐body cryotherapy (WBC). This involves single or repeated exposure(s) to extremely cold dry air (below ‐100°C) in a specialised chamber or cabin for two to four minutes per exposure. This review aimed to find out whether WBC reduced muscle soreness, improved recovery and was safe for those people for whom it can be used. \\nResults of the search \\nWe searched medical databases up to August 2015 for studies that compared WBC with a control intervention such as passive rest or no treatment; or with another active intervention such as cold water immersion. We found four small studies. These reported results for a total of 64 physically active young adults. All but four participants were male. The studies were very varied such as the type, temperature, duration and frequency of the WBC and the exercises used to induce muscle soreness. There were two comparisons: WBC compared with a control intervention; and WBC compared with far‐infrared therapy. \\nKey results \\nAll four studies compared WBC with either passive rest or no treatment. These provided some evidence that WBC may reduce muscle soreness (pain at rest) at 1, 24, 48 and 72 hours after exercise. However, the evidence also included the possibility that WBC may not make a difference or may make the pain worse. There was some weak evidence that WBC may improve well‐being at 24 hours. There was no report and probably no monitoring of adverse events in these four studies. \\nOne very small study also compared WBC with far‐infrared therapy and reported lower levels of muscle soreness one hour after the treatment. \\nQuality of the evidence \\nAll four studies had aspects that could undermine the reliability of their results. We decided that the evidence was of very low quality for all outcomes. Thus, the findings remain very uncertain and further research may provide evidence that could change our conclusions. \\nConclusions \\nThe currently available evidence is insufficient to support the use of WBC for preventing and treating muscle soreness after exercise in adults. Furthermore, the best prescription of WBC and its safety are not known. \\n', '10.1002-14651858.CD013379.pub2-pls.txt': \"Strategies to help adults with a breathing tube to communicate\\nWhat is the issue? \\nPatients needing a machine to support breathing cannot speak due to a tube delivering gas to the lungs bypassing their voice box. Patients mouth words, gesture, and use facial expressions. However, these are very difficult to understand. Weakened muscles and difficulty concentrating, which are common in critical illness, makes using aids such as writing equipment or communication boards difficult. Consistent evidence on which communication aids are effective is lacking. \\nWhy is this important? \\nDifficulty communicating places people at increased risk of harm, causes distress to patients and family, and causes stress for healthcare staff. \\nWhat evidence did we find? \\nWe searched for studies (to 30 July 2020) exploring aids used to help people with a breathing tube to communicate. We found 11 studies involving 1931 participants admitted to intensive care units. We also looked for studies involving people needing a breathing tube and living at home or in long‐term care, but found none. Eight studies used communication boards or apps. Three studies used aids that help a patient to speak with the breathing tube in place. All studies compared the communication aid to routine communication practices. For six studies, routine practice did not include use of any type of communication aid. For the remaining five studies, usual care comprised a range of communication aids routinely used in the participating intensive care units including a communication board, paper notepad, and routine timing of the use of speech aids. We are unsure about whether the early use of aids to help with speaking may increase the number of people who can say words that can be understood or shorten the time to be able to speak. The evidence was of very low quality. \\nSimilarly, compared to routine care in which an aid is not used, we are uncertain about the effects of communication boards on patient satisfaction. We are not sure about the effect on psychological distress and quality of life due to uncertainty in the evidence. Communication aids that help people to speak may have little or no effect on intensive care unit length of stay (low‐quality evidence). We are uncertain of possible harms \\xa0with use of communication aids as only three studies reported this, and all measured different adverse events, and two were very small studies. \\nWhat does this mean? \\nWe are unsure whether using speaking aids in intensive care might increase the number of people who can say words that can be understood. Use of communication boards may increase patient satisfaction, but we are not sure of these findings because of very low‐quality evidence. This means further studies are likely to change our understanding of the effects of communication aids.

Melanoma is one of the most dangerous forms and it is important to identify it early so that it can be removed. If it is not recognised when first brought to the attention of doctors (also known as a false‐negative test result) treatment can be delayed resulting in the melanoma spreading to other organs in the body and possibly causing early death. Cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC) and basal cell carcinoma (BCC) are usually localised skin cancers, although cSCC can spread to other parts of the body and BCC can cause disfigurement if not recognised early. Calling something a skin cancer when it is not really a skin cancer (a false‐positive result) may result in unnecessary surgery and other investigations that can cause stress and worry to the patient. Making the correct diagnosis is important. Mistaking one skin cancer for another can lead to the wrong treatment being used or lead to a delay in effective treatment. \\nWhat is the aim of the review? \\nThe aim of this Cochrane Review was to find out whether teledermatology is accurate enough to identify which people with skin lesions need to be referred to see a specialist dermatologist (a doctor concerned with disease of the skin) and who can be safely reassured that their lesion (damage or change of the skin) is not malignant. We included 22 studies to answer this question. \\nWhat was studied in the review? \\nTeledermatology means sending pictures of skin lesions or rashes to a specialist for advice on diagnosis or management. It is a way for primary care doctors (general practitioners (GPs)) to get an opinion from a specialist dermatologist without having to refer patients through the normal referral pathway. Teledermatology can involve sending photographs or magnified images of a skin lesion taken with a special camera (dermatoscope) to a skin specialist to look at or it might involve immediate discussion about a skin lesion between a GP and a skin specialist using videoconferencing. \\nWhat are the main results of the review? \\nThe review included 22 studies, 16 studies comparing teledermatology diagnoses to the final lesion diagnoses (diagnostic accuracy) for 4057 lesions and 879 malignant cases and five studies comparing teledermatology decisions to the decisions that would be made with the patient present (referral accuracy) for 1449 lesions and 270 'positive' cases. \\nThe studies were very different from each other in terms of the types of people with suspicious skin cancer lesions included and the type of teledermatology used. A single reliable estimate of the accuracy of teledermatology could not be made. For the correct diagnosis of a lesion to be a skin cancer, data suggested that less than 7% of malignant skin lesions were missed by teledermatology. Study results were too variable to tell us how many people would be referred unnecessarily for a specialist dermatology appointment following a teledermatology consultation. Without access to teledermatology services however, most of the lesions included in these studies would likely be referred to a dermatologist. \\nHow reliable are the results of the studies of this review? \\nIn the included studies, the final diagnosis of skin cancer was made by lesion biopsy (taking a small sample of the lesion so it could be examined under a microscope) and the absence of skin cancer was confirmed by biopsy or by follow‐up over time to make sure the skin lesion remained negative for melanoma. This is likely to have been a reliable method for deciding whether people really had skin cancer. In a few studies, a diagnosis of no skin cancer was made by a skin specialist rather than biopsy. This is less likely to have been a reliable method for deciding whether people really had skin cancer*. Poor reporting of what was done in the study made it difficult for us to say how reliable the study results are. Selecting some patients from specialist clinics instead of primary care along with different ways of doing teledermatology were common problems. \\nWho do the results of this review apply to? \\nStudies were conducted in: Europe (64%), North America (18%), South America (9%) or Oceania (9%). The average age of people who were studied was 52 years; however, several studies included at least some people under the age of 16 years. The percentage of people with skin cancer ranged between 2% and 88% with an average of 30%, which is much higher than would be observed in a primary care setting in the UK. \\nWhat are the implications of this review? \\nTeledermatology is likely to be a good way of helping GPs to decide which skin lesions need to be seen by a skin specialist. Our review suggests that using magnified images, in addition to photographs of the lesion, improves accuracy. More research is needed to establish the best way of providing teledermatology services. \\nHow up‐to‐date is this review? \\nThe review authors searched for and used studies published up to August 2016.\\n*In these studies, biopsy, clinical follow‐up or specialist clinician diagnosis were the reference comparisons. \\n\", '10.1002-14651858.CD005457.pub4-abstract.txt': 'Carbetocin for preventing postpartum haemorrhage\\nIn low‐ and middle‐income countries, postpartum haemorrhage is a major cause of maternal deaths and ill health. In high‐income countries, the problems are much less but there is still a small risk of major bleeding problems for women after giving birth. Active management of the third stage of labour, which is generally used to reduce blood loss at birth, consists of giving the mother a drug that helps the uterus to contract, early cord clamping and controlled cord traction to deliver the placenta. Different drugs have been tried and generally either intramuscular oxytocin or intramuscular syntometrine is given. Carbetocin is an oxytocin agonist. Oxytocin agonists are a group of drugs that mimic the oxytocin action, oxytocin being the natural hormone that helps to reduce blood loss at birth. This review includes 11 randomised controlled trials involving 2635 women. The trials compared carbetocin against either oxytocin or syntometrine given after delivery, vaginally or by caesarean section. The comparison between intramuscular carbetocin and oxytocin showed that there was no difference in the risk of heavy bleeding, but that women who received carbetocin were less likely to require other medications to produce uterine contractions following caesarean sections. Comparisons between carbetocin and syntometrine showed that women who received carbetocin had less blood loss compared to women who received syntometrine after vaginal delivery, and were much less likely to experience side effects such as nausea and vomiting. The incidence of hypertension at 30 and 60 minutes post delivery was also significantly lower in women who received carbetocin compared to those who received syntometrine. Five of the 11 studies were known to be supported by a pharmaceutical company. \\n', '10.1002-14651858.CD006297.pub2-abstract.txt': 'Intermediate acting versus long acting insulin for type 1 diabetes mellitus\\nDiabetes mellitus type 1 is a chronic disease with short and long term complications. The treatment for this disease is insulin administration, with basal and bolus insulin preparations being its main stay. Neutral Protamine Hagedorn (NPH) insulin had previously been considered the standard of care for basal insulin replacement in blood glucose lowering for people with type 1 diabetes mellitus. Over the years, newer and longer acting insulins with a more physiological action profile became available: insulin ultralente, and later insulin glargine and insulin detemir. Their theoretical advantages lead to the thought of a beneficial effect on glucose level and rate of complications, such as very low levels of glucose or long term complications. The aim of this review was to assess whether this theoretical advantage is translated into real‐life benefits, by comparing the effect of long acting insulins to intermediate acting insulins on diabetes control.  Twenty‐three studies fulfilled our inclusion criteria with a total of 3872 and 2915 participants in the intervention and in the control group, respectively. The methodological quality of all the studies was rated intermediate to low. Trials duration was no longer than one year. The level of glycosylated haemoglobin, a marker of diabetes control, was lower in the long acting insulin group, but the observed difference was of doubtful clinical significance. Longer acting insulins were superior mostly in their nocturnal effect, which resulted in a lower level of fasting glucose levels and fewer episodes of nocturnal hypoglycaemia. No data on long term complications were available.  The currently available data can not substantiate conclusions on the benefits and risks of long acting insulins, and long‐term data are of need. \\n', '10.1002-14651858.CD013664.pub2-abstract.txt': \"The use of additional medication during cataract surgery to improve the continued success of a pre‐existing operation (trabeculectomy) \\nWhy is this question important?Glaucoma and cataract are a global problem that can\\xa0impact a person's economic and social circumstances.\\xa0Vision loss from glaucoma is permanent, as the increased eye pressure that occurs in glaucoma damages the optic nerve which carries signals from the eye to the brain. The primary aim of treatment for glaucoma is to reduce this\\xa0pressure, hence\\xa0slowing\\xa0down any progressive damage to vision. \\nAlthough medical and laser treatments are effective in treating glaucoma, an operation known as a\\xa0trabeculectomy is required when these treatments do not stop progression of damage to vision. A small hole is cut in the white of the eye to allow excess fluid to drain from the eye. When a person with a trabeculectomy undergoes cataract surgery, an additional medication is often used to stop the eye healing too much and creating scar tissue, which can block the drainage hole and cause the trabeculectomy to fail. \\nIn this review, we looked at patients with a functioning trabeculectomy who were undergoing cataract surgery and who received additional medication (5‐fluorouracil, mitomycin C, or anti‐vascular endothelial growth factor therapy) versus those who did not receive any additional medication. \\nHow did we identify and evaluate the evidence?We searched for\\xa0randomised\\xa0controlled trials (studies in which people are randomly assigned to one of two or more treatment groups), because these studies provide the strongest evidence about the effects of a given treatment.

They often understand social interactions and communication differently to other people. People with ASD may also be less flexible in their thinking than other people, which may make it more difficult for them to use psychological therapies in the way that they are usually presented. The opinions of people with ASD are valuable in helping clinicians decide which research areas related to ASD should take priority. \\nSomeone who has been diagnosed with OCD has certain symptoms which, to some extent, affect how they are able to get on with their lives. Someone with OCD has persistent thoughts, although they don't want the thoughts and often think that the thoughts are unreasonable. These thoughts are often worries about themselves or someone else being harmed or about something not being perfect or just right. Sometimes the person with OCD feels as if they have to think thoughts or do actions repeatedly to 'make things right', even though they often really know that they don't need to. The repeated actions might be something like washing their hands. \\nResearch has shown that people with ASD are more likely to develop OCD. People may have certain genes that make them more likely to develop both ASD and OCD, or it may be that the way people with ASD tend to think makes them more likely to have OCD. \\nCognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) has been used for a long time to treat OCD. CBT is usually carried out by visiting a therapist, but it can be delivered in different ways, such as online. CBT involves talking about the repeated thoughts that occur and helping the person manage and reduce them, and also involves trying to carry out compulsive actions less often. Because people with ASD sometimes have a different way of thinking and communicating, clinicians have wondered if CBT would be as useful to treat OCD in people with ASD as it is in people who have OCD but don't have ASD. Other researchers have devised ways to change the way that CBT is delivered to people with ASD to help them to get the most out of the treatment, and this is called 'adapted CBT'. Studies have shown that adapted CBT is useful for some anxiety disorders that occur in ASD. However, not as many studies have looked at how adapted CBT might be useful for OCD in people with ASD. \\nSearch \\nWe searched for randomised controlled trials of delivery of CBT to people with OCD who also had ASD. A randomised controlled trial is a trial where the participants are randomly allocated to CBT or another treatment group so that the people running the trial have no say about and do not know to which group the participants belong. The other treatment group is called the control group. In these studies, the people in the control group do not receive CBT, but they may have sessions with their therapists that do not include CBT, or they may be on a waiting list. If meeting with your therapist or waiting for time to pass were just as helpful as CBT, for example, then the results would be less likely to show a difference between the outcomes of the treatment group and the control group. Conversely, if CBT was more effective, then we might expect to see the CBT group doing better than the control group. Therefore, at the end of each trial, when the results in the treatment group are compared to the results in the control group, it gives information about how effective CBT might be for people with OCD and ASD. The evidence in this review is current to August 2020. \\nConclusion \\nWe found that there was only one published randomised controlled trial of delivery of CBT to people with OCD and ASD that met our search criteria. The control group in this trial was given a treatment called 'anxiety management' which helped the participants to manage anxiety but did not help them to deal specifically with repeated thoughts and actions, as CBT does. This study aimed to see if either anxiety management or CBT was better at treating OCD in people with ASD, but the study did not find a difference in response between the two treatments. \\n\", '10.1002-14651858.CD013393.pub2-pls.txt': \"After using shock waves to break up kidney stones, do medicines called alpha‑blockers help to get rid of the stone fragments? \\nWhat are kidney stones? \\nWaste products in the blood can sometimes form crystals that collect inside the kidneys. These can build up over time to form a hard stone‐like lump, called a kidney stone. \\nKidney stones can develop in both\\xa0kidneys especially in people with certain medical conditions or who are taking certain medicines, or if people do not drink enough water or fluids. Stones can cause severe pain, fever and a kidney infection if they block the ureter. \\nTreatments for kidney stones \\nMost stones are small enough to pass out in the urine: drinking plenty of water and other fluids will help. Larger kidney stones may be too big to pass out naturally and are usually removed by surgery. \\nShock wave lithotripsy is a non‐surgical way to treat stones in the kidney or ureter. High energy sound waves are applied to the outside of the body to break kidney stones into smaller pieces. After shock wave treatment, medicines called alpha‐blockers are sometimes given to help the stone fragments pass out naturally. \\nAlpha‐blockers work by relaxing muscles and helping to keep blood vessels open.

We also wanted to find out about potential unwanted effects that might be associated with alpha‐blockers. \\nWhat did we do? \\nWe searched for studies that looked at giving alpha‐blockers to adults, after shock wave treatment, to clear kidney stone fragments. \\nWe looked for randomized controlled studies, in which the treatments that people received were decided at random, because these studies usually give the most reliable evidence about the effects of a treatment. \\nSearch date: we included evidence published up to 27 February 2020. \\nWhat we found \\nWe found 40 studies including 4793 people who had shock wave treatment to break up their kidney stones.

Most studies did not report their sources of funding. \\nThe studies compared giving an alpha‐blocker with giving a placebo (dummy) treatment or usual care (could include antibiotics, painkillers and fluids given by mouth or through a drip). \\nTamsulosin was the most commonly studied alpha‐blocker; the others were silodosin, doxazosin, terazosin and alfuzosin. \\nWhat are the results of our review? \\nCompared with usual care or a placebo treatment, alpha‐blockers may:\\nclear kidney stones in more people: in 111 more people for every 1000 people treated (36 studies); \\nclear stones faster: by nearly four days (14 studies);\\nreduce the need for extra treatments to clear stones: in 32 fewer people for every 1000 people treated (12 studies); and \\ncause fewer unwanted effects: affecting 103\\xa0fewer people for every 1000 people treated (seven studies). \\nMost unwanted effects were emergency visits to hospitals, and people going back into hospital for stone related problems. Unwanted effects were more common in people who had usual care or a placebo treatment than in people given alpha‐blockers. \\nNone of the studies looked at people's quality of life (well‐being).\\nHow reliable are these results? \\nWe are uncertain about these results because they were based on studies in which it was unclear how people were chosen to take part; it was unclear if results were reported fully; some results were inconsistent and in some studies the results varied widely.\\xa0 Our results are likely to change if further evidence becomes available. \\nConclusions \\nGiving an alpha‐blocker after shock wave treatment to break up kidney stones might clear the fragments faster, in more people and reduce the need for extra treatments.

Pain management involves measuring pain and providing pain treatment if necessary. We aimed to find out whether step‐by‐step guidance (an algorithm) for nurses on how to manage pain can reduce pain or behaviours that may indicate someone is in distress (such as hitting, shouting or wandering). \\nWhat was studied in the review? \\nPeople with dementia in nursing homes often experience pain. However, they cannot always tell their caregivers if they are in pain, so it can be difficult to recognise, and we know that nursing home residents with dementia receive less pain medication than those without dementia. Untreated pain can have a negative impact on well‐being and health, and can also be one reason for challenging behaviour, such as aggression. The use of detailed step‐by‐step guidance for nursing staff, in this review called an algorithm, is designed to improve pain management. Algorithms start with a structured pain assessment and then set out different treatment steps, which can be non‐medication or medication treatments for reducing pain. If pain is detected, the treatment described in the first step is applied. If this treatment does not reduce pain, the treatment from the next step is applied, and so on. \\nStudies included in the review \\nIn June 2021 we searched for trials that investigated pain management based on the use of an algorithm. We found three studies including 808 participants. Two of these studies compared algorithm‐based pain management with education for the nursing staff on pain and dementia, and one study compared algorithm‐based pain management with usual care. \\nThe level of pain and the severity of the participants' dementia differed in the three studies. One study included all the residents in the nursing homes, most of whom had no pain, or almost no pain, at the start of the study (fewer than half of the included people experienced pain), and two studies included only people with mild to moderate pain. In one study the participants' dementia was of mild or moderate severity and in two studies the participants had severe dementia. \\nIn two studies, those people with dementia who were able to do so reported on their own pain and the nursing staff also judged whether the participants showed signs of pain. In the third study, pain was rated by members of the research team, but not by the participants themselves. The nurses and the researchers used observations of things like facial expressions, gestures and breathing to judge whether someone was in pain. \\nWhat are the key findings? \\nWhen we looked at the study in which people started out on average with no pain, or almost no pain, we could not be certain whether algorithm‐based pain management had an effect on the intensity of pain they experienced during the study. This was true whether the study participants reported on their own pain or whether nurses judged pain intensity. We also could not tell from this study whether algorithm‐based pain management reduced challenging behaviour. \\nFor people who started out with mild to moderate pain, we found that, compared to education for nursing staff, algorithm‐based pain management may have little or no effect on pain intensity reported by the people themselves (based on the results from one study). When the pain was rated by somebody else (a 'proxy', who was a nurse or research assistant), we found that algorithm‐based pain management may be better than usual care, although it may not be more effective than pain education. However, it is difficult to be sure about the accuracy of pain ratings made by other people. \\nOur confidence in the results was limited because of the small number of included studies, the variation in the intensity of pain and in the severity of the participants' dementia at the start of the trials, and the quality of the studies. \\nNo study looked for harmful effects, and no study described that any harmful effects occurred. \\nWhat is the conclusion? \\nWe found no good evidence that introducing an algorithm to guide pain management for people with dementia in nursing homes is any better than education for nursing staff for reducing pain or challenging behaviours, but it may be better than usual care at reducing pain (rated by observers). The amount of evidence was small, and we could not be certain of the results. More research in this area would be valuable. \\n\", '10.1002-14651858.CD013309.pub3-pls.txt': \"Devices to continuously monitor sugar (glucose) levels in the blood in newborns born preterm \\nReview questions \\nWhat are the benefits and harms of the use of subcutaneous (under the skin) sensors for continuous\\xa0glucose monitoring (CGM) with or without an algorithm (a set of mathematical rules) to correct too high or too low \\u200b\\u200b\\u200b\\u200b\\u200b levels of blood glucose versus intermittent modalities to measure blood glucose\\xa0with or without an algorithm to guide the correction of too high or too low blood glucose in preterm infants 1. at risk of too high or too low \\u200b\\u200b\\u200b\\u200b\\u200b\\u200b levels of blood glucose; 2. with proven\\xa0too low \\u200b\\u200b\\u200b\\u200b\\u200b\\u200blevels of blood glucose; and 3. with proven\\xa0too high\\u200b\\u200b\\u200b\\u200b\\u200b\\u200b levels of blood glucose? \\nBackground \\nNewborns born too early ('preterm') are susceptible to levels of blood glucose that are too high or too low.

As part of this operation, surgeons remove lymph nodes in that part of the body, which is an important part of the immune system. Traditionally, only the lymph nodes close to the bladder and its major blood vessels were removed. This is called a standard lymph node dissection which removes lymph nodes as high up as to where the main blood vessels for the pelvis and the leg split up. Some people think that also removing lymph nodes further away from the bladder is better in getting rid of cancer. This is called an extended lymph node dissection. It removes lymph nodes as high up as the blood vessels that supply the lower part of the intestines.

Sleeping sickness has two clinical stages. This review only examines treating the second‐stage, where people develop symptoms caused by invasion of the central nervous system (CNS), resulting in changes in the nervous system. Death is inevitable without treatment. Drugs for treatment are few, often require intravenous infusion every day over several weeks, and have serious side effects.

The most common symptoms include bloody diarrhoea, abdominal pain, and a sudden almost uncontrollable urge to pass stool. Some people have other symptoms including sore joints, mouth sores, and inflammation in their eyes. When someone is experiencing symptoms of UC, they are said to have 'active' disease. When symptoms improve with treatment, the disease is said to be responding to therapy. When symptoms stop, the disease is said to be in 'remission'. People with UC in remission are often given therapy with medicines to try and prolong (maintain) their remission or response to therapy. \\nWhat did the review study? \\nThis review studied the use of antibiotics in the treatment of UC. Eleven studies considered antibiotics as a therapy for achieving remission and one study as therapy for maintaining remission. \\nAntibiotics could theoretically be helpful as they might be able to fight harmful bacteria in the gut that are thought to be a partial cause for the presence of UC symptoms. \\nCurrently, most doctors do not recommend the use of antibiotics unless the patient has an infection. \\nWhat were the main results of the review? \\nWe searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs; clinical studies where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups) comparing antibiotics with another treatment or dummy treatment.

In terms of safety, antibiotics may be similar to placebo, but the evidence is of low certainty. \\n4. We are uncertain about how antibiotics compare to other treatments because there is not enough good evidence to make a judgement. \\nConclusion \\nThere is no difference between antibiotics and placebo when added to standard therapies to achieve remission or improvement of symptoms in the short term. However, they may help to lessen the number of people who do not achieve remission, and they probably lead to fewer numbers of people who have not achieved improvement of symptoms at 12 months. \\nNo conclusions can be drawn on other treatments or safety due to lack of evidence, even though there may be a possibility that antibiotics are as safe as placebo. Further research would be needed to clarify the usefulness of antibiotics in the treatment of UC; however, such studies should focus on longer‐term outcomes given the findings of this review. \\nHow up‐to‐date is this review? \\nThis review is up‐to‐date as of December 2021.\\n\", '10.1002-14651858.CD006682.pub6-abstract.txt': \"Length of time needed for antibiotic treatment given directly into the blood stream to clear acute chest infections in people with cystic fibrosis \\nReview question \\nWe reviewed the evidence about how long intravenous antibiotic treatment (antibiotics given directly into the blood stream) is needed to clear flare ups of chest symptoms in people with cystic fibrosis. \\nBackground \\nFlare ups of symptoms (exacerbations) in people with cystic fibrosis are treated aggressively to prevent further damage to the lungs. This practice has led to better survival rates for people with cystic fibrosis in recent years. However, there are no clear guidelines on how long treatment with intravenous antibiotics should be to treat these flare ups. Different centres tend to use different treatment regimens. Most centres use 10 or 14 days, extending this to 21 days if there is no improvement in a person's symptoms. This is an update of previously published reviews. \\nSearch date \\nThe evidence is current to: 30 May 2019.\\nStudy characteristics \\nNo completed studies have compared different lengths of treatment with intravenous antibiotics, but there is one study under way looking at this question. When the results are published, we plan to include the study in this review. \\nKey results \\nFurther research is needed to find the best duration of treatment for exacerbations. A shorter duration of treatment may be better as these courses of treatment are easier for people to complete. They are also less expensive and cause fewer drug reactions than longer treatments. However, it is not clear if shorter treatment is enough to treat infections adequately. It is also not clear whether shorter treatment results in early recurrence or increased frequency of chest infections. \\n\", '10.1002-14651858.CD013666.pub2-pls.txt': 'Short‐acting inhaled bronchodilators for cystic fibrosis\\nReview question \\nWe reviewed the evidence for using short‐acting inhaled bronchodilators (treatments which widen and open the airways, making it easier to breathe) in people with cystic fibrosis. Short‐acting bronchodilators take effect quickly and generally\\xa0last 4 to 6 hours. We were interested in any type of short‐acting inhaled bronchodilator, given at any dose, and by any type of device (inhalers or nebulisers). \\nBoth nebulisers and inhalers deliver medicine. Nebulisers turn liquid medication into an easily‐inhaled mist. They vary in type but need a power source, e.g. a rechargeable battery, to function. Inhalers deliver short bursts of medicine (as an aerosol or dry powder) via a manual handheld device. The most common type of inhaler is a metered‐dose inhaler. Inhalers can be used with spacers (empty tubes, usually made from plastic that slot onto the mouthpiece of the inhaler).\\xa0 \\nInhaled bronchodilators are used by many people with cystic fibrosis to help them breathe, and to make it easier to clear mucus from their lungs.

The trials were too small and there were not enough data to show if there was an effect or not. \\nOnly six of the 11 trials reported on harmful effects of treatment: one trial reported no harmful effects and five trials reported mild tremors, dry mouth and fatigue. \\nCertainty of the evidence \\nThe certainty of the evidence across all trials was very low. All trials used a cross‐over design where the participants are given one treatment and then swapped to the other treatment with a washout period (the length of time for a drug to be eliminated from the body) in between. It is possible that the clinical status of participants was not the same at the beginning of the first treatment phase as at the beginning of the second treatment phase.

The aim of this Cochrane review was to find out whether the use of a new imaging technique, called indocyanine green angiography (ICGA), during reconstructive breast surgery can reduce necrosis (cell death) of the overlying breast skin and other complications such as infections, following reconstructive breast surgery after mastectomy.  We included women who had undergone skin‐sparing mastectomy (that is, where the whole breast including nipple is removed, sparing the overlying breast skin) for breast cancer or women who were at high risk of developing breast cancer (because of faulty genes). We collected and analysed all relevant studies to provide a review that will inform doctors and patients on ICGA use in reconstructive breast surgery.  Key messages The use of ICGA during reconstructive breast surgery seems to reduce the chance of reoperations when compared to clinical evaluation only. We are uncertain about the effect of ICGA on reducing the chance of necrosis of the overlying breast skin and other post‐surgery complications when compared to clinical evaluation only. The quality of studies used for this review is very low, meaning that we are not confident of the results. We need high‐quality studies that have randomised women to a group of ICGA assessment or clinical evaluation alone to have a more definitive answer.  What was studied in the review? Around 40% of women with breast cancer need to undergo mastectomy (removal of the whole breast). A skin‐sparing mastectomy is a common operation in which the overlying breast skin is preserved. After skin‐sparing mastectomy, women have the option to undergo reconstructive breast surgery. This operation carries some risks and complications, including an operation to correct complications (reoperation), spontaneous reopening of the surgical wound (dehiscence), infection, blood pooling outside of a blood vessel (haematoma) and a pocket filled with blood plasma underneath the skin (seroma).  Preserving the blood supply of the overlying breast skin during skin‐sparing mastectomy is crucial. When the blood supply is poor, skin will not survive, and surgeons need to intervene to prevent postoperative complications. Usually, the surgeon will assess tissue colour, the time taken for colour to return to the skin after pressure is applied (capillary refill), temperature, skin’s elasticity, and bleeding of the skin.  ICGA is a new imaging technique that assesses the blood supply to the tissue. It can assess blood flow in the overlying breast skin better than clinical judgement alone. We collected studies that compared the use of ICGA to clinical evaluation by a surgeon during immediate reconstructive breast surgery after skin‐sparing mastectomy. In these studies, women underwent immediate reconstructive surgery with their own tissue from another area of the woman’s body or with a breast implant.  What are the main results of this review? We found nine studies that compared the number of postoperative complications in women who had ICGA assessment of their breast skin versus clinical evaluation. Six studies were performed in the USA, two in Denmark and one in Japan. There were a total 1589 women with 2199 breast reconstructions. Studies reported the number of complications on a per patient basis or on a per breast basis. We present information based on both types of data.  The main results on a per patient analysis were that: ‐ICGA may reduce reoperation rates, and ‐we are uncertain as to whether ICGA has an effect on necrosis of the overlying skin of the breast, infection, haematoma and seroma rates. \\nThe main results on a per breast basis were that: ‐ICGA may reduce necrosis of the overlying skin of the breast, reoperation and infection rates, and ‐we are uncertain as to whether ICGA has an effect on haematoma and seroma rates.  The evidence contributing to this review topic is considered to be very low quality. Since randomised controlled trials are found to be one of the most powerful methods in clinical research, it is a major downside that these studies are missing. We emphasise the need for randomised controlled trials to further investigate the use of ICGA in reconstructive breast surgery.  How up‐to‐date is this review?

Treatment with insect venom, usually given by a course of injections (called venom immunotherapy), is thought to reduce the risk of allergic reactions to an insect sting. In this review, we evaluated the effectiveness of venom immunotherapy for preventing allergic reactions to insect stings. \\nFrom analysis of 7 studies, which included 392 participants, we found that this treatment reduces the chance of having a serious allergic reaction to an insect sting by 90%, a consistent finding between studies. Venom immunotherapy also significantly improves the quality of life of people who have had a serious allergic reaction to an insect sting by reducing anxiety and possible limitation of activities caused by fear of insects. However, almost 1 in 10 people treated with venom immunotherapy during the trials had an allergic reaction to their treatment. We were unable to find out whether venom immunotherapy prevents fatal allergic reactions to insect stings, because these are so rare. The decision whether to start venom immunotherapy depends on an accurate diagnosis, followed by careful assessment of a person's risk of having another allergic reaction to a sting, the degree to which the insect sting allergy affects their quality of life, and the risk of an allergic reaction to their treatment. \\n\", '10.1002-14651858.CD007920.pub3-abstract.txt': \"Anti‐vascular endothelial growth factor for neovascular glaucoma\\nWhat was the aim of this review? To compare treatment with and without anti‐vascular endothelial growth factor (anti‐VEGF) medications for people with neovascular glaucoma (NVG). \\nKey message It is uncertain whether treatment with anti‐VEGF medications is more beneficial than treatment without anti‐VEGF medications for people with NVG. More research is needed to investigate the long‐term effect of anti‐VEGF medications compared with, or in addition to, conventional treatment. \\nWhat did we study in this review? VEGF is a protein produced by cells in your body, and produces new blood vessels when needed. When cells produce too much VEGF, abnormal blood vessels can grow in the eye. NVG is a type of glaucoma where the angle between the iris (coloured part of the eye) and the cornea (transparent front part of the eye) is closed by new blood vessels growing in the eye, hence, the name 'neovascular'. New blood vessels can cause scarring and narrowing, which can eventually lead to complete closure of the angle. This results in increased eye pressure since the fluid in the eye cannot drain properly. In NVG, the eye is often red and painful, and the vision is abnormal. High pressure in the eye can lead to blindness. \\nAnti‐VEGF medication is a type of medicine that blocks VEGF, therefore, slowing the growth of blood vessels. It is administered by injection into the eye. It can be used early stage, when conventional treatment may not be possible. Most studies report short‐term (generally four to six weeks) benefits of anti‐VEGF medication, but long‐term benefits are not clear. \\nWhat were the main results of this review? We included four studies enrolling a total of 263 participants with NVG. In one study, results beyond the treatment period of 1 week could not be evaluated. In another study, results were uncertain due to the limitation of study design. \\nThe last two studies reported different results for lowering eye pressure; one study showed inconclusive results, and the other study showed that anti‐VEGF medications were more effective. The certainty of the evidence in these studies was low, due to limitations in the study designs and inconsistency of results. Therefore, available evidence is insufficient to recommend the routine use of anti‐VEGF medication in individuals with NVG. \\nHow up to date is the review?

This might involve seeing or hearing things that other people cannot see or hear (hallucinations), or believing things that are not true (delusions). The combination of hallucinations and delusional thinking can cause severe distress and a change in behaviour. A first episode psychosis is the first time a person experiences an episode of psychosis. Recent‐onset psychosis is the first few years of the illness after someone experiences it for the first time. \\nPsychosis is treatable \\nMany people recover from a first episode and never experience another psychotic episode.\\nEarly intervention teams specialise in treating recent‐onset psychosis, and aim to treat psychosis as quickly and intensively as possible. Intensive, early treatment of psychosis may help more people to continue with their treatment and to recover. \\nEarly intervention treatment usually lasts for two or three years. After early intervention treatment, a person will be cared for by their doctor or by standard community mental health professionals. \\nWhy we did this Cochrane Review \\nWe wanted to find out if longer treatment (for up to 5 years) by specialist early intervention teams was more successful at treating recent‐onset psychosis than the usual two or three years of treatment followed by treatment by non‐specialist teams. \\nWhat did we do? \\nWe searched for studies that looked at the use of longer treatment of recent‐onset psychosis by specialist early intervention teams. \\nWe looked for randomised controlled studies, in which the treatments people received were decided at random.

Fatty liver can lead to liver damage resulting in inflammation (non‐alcohol‐related steatohepatitis, or NASH) or liver scarring (liver cirrhosis). Various medical treatments have been tried for treatment of NAFLD. However, no current evidence suggests that any of them work. Nutritional supplementation has the potential to decrease liver damage, but whether this occurs is currently unclear. The authors of this review collected and analysed all relevant randomised clinical trials with the aim of finding out what is the best treatment. They found 202 randomised clinical trials (studies where participants are randomly assigned to one of two treatment groups). During analysis of data, review authors used standard Cochrane methods, which allow comparison of only two treatments at a time. In addition, review authors used advanced techniques that allow comparison of multiple treatments at the same time (usually referred as 'network (or indirect) meta‐analysis'). \\nDate of literature searchFebruary 2021. \\nKey messagesOnly 19 trials were at low risk of bias, and because of this, uncertainty about the findings of this review is considerable. Studies that reported clinically important liver damage or its complications studied participants for a period of 2 months to 28 months. During this period, clinically important outcomes related to NAFLD such as death, liver‐related complications such as liver cirrhosis (scarring of the liver), liver decompensation (complications caused by scarring of the liver), liver transplantation, hepatocellular carcinoma (liver cancer), and death due to liver disease were rare, even without any treatment. No evidence suggests that any nutritional supplementation decreased these. A possible reason for complications of liver disease being rare in trial participants may be the short follow‐up period given in these trials (participants were followed only for a period of 2 months to 28 months). Liver‐related complications due to NAFLD develop over 8 to 28 years. Therefore, it is unlikely that differences in clinical outcomes can be noted in trials with less than 5 to 10 years of follow‐up. \\nWhat was studied in the Review?This Review looked at people of any sex, age, and ethnic origin, with non‐alcohol‐related liver disease. Review authors excluded studies of people with previous liver transplantation. The average age of participants, when reported, ranged from 7 to 61 years. Participants were given different treatments including various vitamins and other nutritional supplements. Review authors wanted to gather and analyse data on death, quality of life, serious and non‐serious adverse events, severe liver damage, complications resulting from severe liver damage, liver cancer, and death due to liver damage ('clinical outcomes').What were the main results of the Review?The 202 studies included 14,200 participants. Study data were sparse. In all, 115 studies with 7732 participants provided data for analyses. Follow‐up of trial participants ranged from 1 month to 28 months (2 months to 28 months for trials that reported clinical outcomes). The Review shows the following.‐ The evidence indicates considerable uncertainty about effects of interventions on all clinical outcomes.‐ Well‐designed trials that collect data over longer follow‐up times are needed in the future to find out the best nutritional supplementation (if any) for people with NAFLD. \\n\", '10.1002-14651858.CD013674.pub2-pls.txt': \"Newer generation antidepressants for depression in children and adolescents: a network meta‐analysis \\nHow well do newer formulations of antidepressants work for children and adolescents with clinical depression? \\nChildren and adolescents (6 to 18 years) with depression (also called ‘major depressive disorder’) experience a range of negative impacts in all areas of their lives and have an increased risk of suicide, suicidal thinking and suicide attempts. Antidepressants have been shown to reduce symptoms of depression, but can also increase the risk of suicide‐related outcomes. \\nWho will be interested in this research? \\nThe research in this Cochrane Review will interest:\\n‐ people who decide policy, and influence decisions about the prescription of antidepressant medicines to children and adolescents; \\n‐ people who prescribe these medicines to children and adolescents;\\n‐ children and adolescents with depression; and\\n‐ those who support and care for them (including their parents and caregivers and clinicians who provide treatment). \\nWhat did we want to find out? \\nWe wanted to find out how well newer formulations (called ‘new generation’) antidepressants work to improve depression in children and adolescents aged 6 to 18 years. New generation antidepressants are those that have been developed recently. They are sometimes referred to as ‘second‐‘ and ‘third‐generation’ antidepressants; they do not include older formulations (tricyclic antidepressants or monoamine oxidase inhibitors). \\nWe wanted to know how these antidepressants affect:\\n‐ symptoms of depression;\\n‐ recovery: no longer meeting diagnostic criteria for major depressive disorder;\\n‐ response or remission: scores on a scale indicating an important reduction in depression or no longer experiencing depression; \\n‐ ability to function in daily life;\\n‐ suicide‐related outcomes; and\\n‐ whether they cause any unwanted effects in children and adolescents.\\nWhat did we do? \\nWe searched for studies that tested new generation antidepressants on children or adolescents (or both) who had been diagnosed with a major depressive disorder. We identified 26 such studies. We then assessed the trustworthiness of those studies, and synthesized the findings across the studies. \\nWhat does the evidence from the review tell us? \\nMost newer antidepressants probably reduce depression symptoms better than a placebo (a 'dummy' treatment that does not contain any medicine but looks identical to the medicine being tested). However, the reduction is small and may not be experienced as important by children and adolescents, their parents and caregivers, or clinicians. When different medications are compared against each other, there may be only small and unimportant differences between most of them for the reduction of symptoms. \\nOur findings reflect what happens on average to individuals, but some individuals may experience a greater response. This might lead to recommendations being made for the use of antidepressants for some individuals in some circumstances. Our findings suggest that sertraline, escitalopram, duloxetine and fluoxetine can be used if medication is being considered. \\nThe impact of medication on depression symptoms should be closely monitored by those prescribing the medication, especially as suicide‐related thinking and behaviour may be increased in those taking these medications. Close monitoring of suicide‐related behaviours is vital in those treated with new generation antidepressants. \\nWhat should happen next? \\nThe studies that provided this evidence largely excluded children and adolescents who: \\n‐ were already thinking about suicide and wanting to take their own lives (i.e. had suicidal ideation); \\n‐ were self‐harming;\\n‐ had other mental health conditions; and\\n‐ had psychosocial difficulties.\\nFuture research should aim to understand the impacts of these medicines in children and adolescents with these problems, who are more typical of those who request clinical services. \\n\", '10.1002-14651858.CD012030.pub2-abstract.txt': 'Psychological therapies to reduce tiredness in patients with incurable cancer\\nBackground \\nPatients with incurable cancer often experience tiredness (fatigue) during cancer treatment. Psychological therapies may help to reduce this symptom. Tiredness in cancer patients receiving cancer treatment may be treated with psychological therapies aimed at influencing or changing thoughts, emotions, behaviours, social interactions, or a combination of these (e.g. cognitive‐behavioural therapies, supportive‐expressive group therapies). This review looked at how effective psychological therapies are in reducing tiredness in patients with incurable cancer receiving cancer treatment. \\nStudy characteristics \\nIn November 2016, we searched for clinical trials looking at psychological therapies in patients with incurable cancer receiving cancer treatment. We found 14 small studies of very low quality reporting data on tiredness outcomes, 12 of which provided data for analyses. A limited number (three studies) reported results about side effects; these studies investigated a psychological therapy combined with medication. \\nKey findings \\nReview authors found no support for the effectiveness of psychological therapies in reducing tiredness when assessed directly following the intervention. Very low‐quality evidence suggests that psychological therapies may improve physical functioning directly after the intervention and may improve tiredness at first follow‐up. Evidence shows no support for the effectiveness of psychosocial therapies in improving other domains of functioning. Limited evaluation of potential harm suggests no differences in side effects between patients receiving psychological therapy and those given usual care. Limited good quality evidence allows no conclusions on the use of psychological therapies in people with incurable cancer. Larger, high‐quality trials are needed to find out whether psychological therapies help reduce tiredness for people with incurable cancer during cancer treatment. \\nQuality of the evidence \\nWe rated the quality of study evidence using four levels: very low, low, moderate, and high. Very low‐quality evidence means that we are very uncertain about the results. High‐quality evidence means that we are very confident in the results. Included studies had design problems and included a very small number of participants. Therefore, the quality of the evidence in this review is very low, and results of this review should be interpreted with caution. \\n', '10.1002-14651858.CD013756.pub2-pls.txt': 'What are the benefits and risks of electrical spinal cord and dorsal root ganglion stimulation for the treatment of chronic pain in adults? \\nWhy this question is important \\nPersistent (chronic) pain is a common problem that affects people from all walks of life. It can be the result of a wide range of different medical conditions and is sometimes unexplained, but it often causes substantial suffering, distress and disability and can have major impacts on a person\\'s quality of life. \\nImplanted spinal neuromodulation (SNMD) interventions involve surgically implanting wires (electrodes) into the space around nerves or the spinal cord that are connected to a \"pulse generator\" device which is usually implanted under the patient\\'s skin. This delivers electrical stimulation to the nerves or spinal cord. It is thought that this stimulation interferes with danger messages being sent to the spinal cord and brain with the goal of reducing the perception of pain. Once implanted with a SNMD device people live with the device implanted, potentially on a permanent basis. We reviewed the evidence to find out whether these interventions were effective at reducing pain, disability and medication use, at improving quality of life and to find out the risk and type of complications they might cause. There are two broad types of SNMD: spinal cord stimulation (SCS), where electrodes are placed near the spinal cord and dorsal root ganglion stimulation (DRGS) where electrodes are placed near the nerve root, where the nerve branches off from the spinal cord. \\nHow we identified and assessed the evidence \\nFirst, we searched for all relevant studies in the medical literature. We then compared the results, and summarised the evidence from all the studies. Finally, we assessed the certainty of the evidence. We considered factors such as the way studies were conducted, study sizes, and consistency of findings across studies. Based on our assessments, we rated the evidence as being of very low, low, moderate or high certainty. \\nWhat we found \\nWe found 15 published studies that included 908 people with persistent pain due to a variety of causes including nerve disease, chronic low back pain, chronic neck pain and complex regional pain syndrome. All of these studies evaluated SCS; no studies evaluated DRGS. \\nEight studies (that included 205 people) compared SCS with a sham (placebo) stimulation, where the electrodes were implanted, but no stimulation was delivered. Six studies that included 684 people compared SCS added with either medical management or physical therapy with medical management or physical therapy on its own. We rated the evidence as being of low, or very low certainty. Limitations in how the studies were conducted and reported, the amount of evidence we found and inconsistency between studies in some instances means that our confidence in the results is limited. \\nThe evidence suggests the following.\\nCompared to receiving medical management or physical therapy alone, people treated with the addition of SCS may experience less pain and higher quality of life after one month or six months of stimulation. There is limited evidence to draw conclusions in the long term of one year or more. It is unclear whether SCS reduces disability or medication use. \\nCompared to a sham (placebo) stimulation, SCS may result in small reductions in pain intensity in the short term that may not be clinically important, but this is currently unclear. There is no evidence at medium or long‐term follow‐up points. \\nSCS can result in complications. These include movement or malfunction of the electrode wires, wound infections and the need for further surgical procedures to fix issues with the implanted devices. We also found instances of serious complications that included one death, nerve damage, lasting muscle weakness, lung injury, serious infection, prolonged hospital stay and the extrusion of a stimulation device through the skin. \\nVery limited evidence around the costs and economics of SCS suggested that SCS increases the costs of healthcare. It was not clear whether SCS was cost‐effective. \\nWhat this means \\nSCS may reduce pain intensity in people with chronic pain. It is currently not clear how much of this effect is due to the SCS itself and how much is due to so‐called \"placebo\" effects, which are the result of the experience of undergoing the procedure and the person\\'s expectations that it will help them. Receiving SCS does present a risk of relatively common complications and less common serious complications. We are currently unsure of the precise degree of this risk. \\nHow up‐to‐date is this review? \\nThe evidence in this review is current to September 2021.\\n', '10.1002-14651858.CD014615-pls.txt': \"Mothers' positions in labour when baby is lying 'back‐to‐back'\\nWhat is the issue? \\nMalposition is when the back of the baby's head lies towards the mother's back. As a result, labour and birth can be long and difficult, sometimes resulting in an operative birth (where the baby is delivered by caesarean section or with special tools to help the baby through the birth canal) and more perineal trauma (damage to the pelvic floor). The baby may be more likely to go to a neonatal care unit. Also, women may experience stress or disappointment with the birth experience.\\xa0 \\nWhy is this important? \\nThe way a pregnant woman is positioned during labour may help rotate a baby so that the back of the baby's head lies towards the front of the mother's abdomen. This improved position may help the mother and baby have a more normal labour and birth. However, it is not yet known which posture, if any, is effective and when is the best time to use it. \\nA systematic review of studies of positions (postures) used by women in labour with a baby in a malposition can provide answers on whether the postures improve birth and other health outcomes for mothers and babies. The summary of this review can be used to update clinical practice guidelines. \\nA Cochrane Review in 2007 reported that the use of the 'hands and knees' posture in labour was ineffective for malposition, but it did reduce labouring women's backache. Since then, more trials have been conducted, some using other postures; these need evaluating to see if those postures work. \\nWhat evidence did we find? \\nWe searched for evidence (published to 13 July 2021) and identified eight studies \\xa0in nine different countries involving 1766 women and their babies.

All the women's \\xa0pregnancies were at least at 36 weeks.\\xa0 \\nThe trials compared use of 'hands and knees' posture or 'side‐lying' (lateral) postures (lying on the same side as the baby, lying on the opposite side to the baby, and lying semi‐prone) to other postures (free posture, lying on back, leaning back, lying on the same side as the baby).\\xa0 \\nFor both the hands and knees posture and side‐lying positions during labour, there may be little or no difference in the numbers of operative births, haemorrhage (profuse bleeding of the mother), severe perineal trauma, and women's satisfaction with their labour and delivery, but there was insufficient evidence to be sure. Many of our outcomes of interest were not reported in the included studies. \\nOverall, we have little to no confidence in the evidence, mainly because there were too few women and babies in the studies, and some studies used unclear methods. \\nWhat does this mean? \\nOverall, it is uncertain whether hands and knees or side‐lying positions in labour improve the health of mother and baby when a baby is in a malposition. However, if women find the use of hands and knees, side‐lying, or other postures in labour comfortable, there is no reason why they should not choose to use them. \\nFurther research is needed to enable optimal fetal positioning. In particular, further research is needed on variations in the postures, the impact of longer use of these postures during labour, and on long‐term outcomes for women and their babies.\\xa0 \\n\", '10.1002-14651858.CD013860.pub2-pls.txt': 'Prophylactic antiemetics for adults receiving intravenous opioids in the acute care setting \\nKey messages \\nMetoclopramide did not reduce the risk of vomiting, nausea, or the need for rescue medication when provided prior to intravenous opioids in the emergency department.\\xa0 \\nIn terms of the severity of nausea, metoclopramide did not help patients any more than placebo (sham treatment). \\nWhat is opioid‐induced emesis? \\nPhysicians often give patients opioids for pain in emergency departments, but over a third experience the side effects of nausea and vomiting (emesis). Some experts have suggested that taking antiemetics before receiving the opioid (that is, as a prophylactic) could prevent these symptoms from occurring. However, these medications have their own side effects, so it is important to understand whether they are effective and safe before routinely using them. \\nWhat did we want to find out? \\nThis review looks at whether taking antiemetics (medications to treat or prevent nausea and vomiting) before receiving an intravenous opioid reduces the risk of experiencing nausea and vomiting as side effects. \\nWhat did we do? \\nWe looked for studies involving adults (aged 16 years or older) who received prophylactic antiemetics compared with either placebo or standard care before receiving an intravenous opioid. \\nWhat did we find? \\nWe found three studies with a total of 527 patients. All the studies used metoclopramide as the antiemetic. Compared with placebo, metoclopramide did not reduce the risk of vomiting, nausea, or the need for an antiemetic later on. There was also no difference in side effects between those who received antiemetics and those who did not. \\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence? \\nThe studies investigated only one medication (metoclopramide) and did not report all the information we were interested in.

Chest physiotherapy is often used to try to clear the mucus from the lungs. We wanted to discover whether using a PEP device (a form of chest physiotherapy) was better or worse than other other forms of chest physiotherapy for clearing the mucus from the lungs in people with CF. A PEP device provides positive pressure behind the mucus to try to push it out of the lungs. This is an update of a previously published review. \\nSearch date \\nThe evidence is current to 20 February 2019.\\nStudy characteristics \\nThe review includes 28 studies with 788 people (from infants to adults) with CF with mild to severe lung disease. The studies compared PEP to other methods of chest physiotherapy; the length of treatment ranged from a single session to two years of treatment. \\nKey results \\nGenerally, the efficacy of PEP is similar to other methods of chest physiotherapy such as postural drainage with percussion, active cycle of breathing techniques, autogenic drainage, oscillatory PEP devices such as the flutter and acapella, thoracic oscillating devices such as the 'Vest', and bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPaP) (typically used for ventilatory support, but by changing the inspiratory and expiratory pressures on the device and combining it with huffing, BiPaP has been used for airway clearance). We found no difference between PEP and other forms of chest physiotherapy in lung function, the amount of mucus cleared from the airways or its related effects on the health of people with CF. However, the rate of flare ups of respiratory symptoms decreased in people using PEP compared to other forms of physiotherapy such as a vibrating PEP device or a vibrating vest. There was some evidence that people with CF may prefer PEP to other chest physiotherapy methods. There was no evidence of PEP causing harm, except in one study where infants performing either PEP or percussion in various positions which use gravity to help drain secretions, experienced some gastro‐oesophageal reflux (regurgitation of food) in head‐down positions; this was more severe in the group using postural drainage with percussion. In all the other trials PEP was performed in a sitting position. \\nIn 10 of the 28 studies studied single PEP treatment sessions. The results from these studies are very limited as they could not report on the number of respiratory infections and lung function did not change with just one treatment. Two one‐year studies compared PEP to postural drainage and percussion; in the study with children, PEP improved their lung function, while in the adult study, lung function declined slightly with both PEP and postural drainage and percussion. Also, the method of performing PEP was different in the two age groups. \\nAlthough PEP seems to have an advantage in reducing flare ups (based on the combined results of a few studies), different physiotherapy techniques and devices may be more or less effective at varying times and in different individuals during baseline function and chest flare ups. Each person should talk to their clinician to help choose which method of airway clearance is best for them and which they will adhere to, so as to provide the best quality of life and long‐term outcomes. \\nQuality of the evidence \\nSome studies were of low quality. These studies highlight the difficulty in comparing studies using PEP compared to other forms of chest physiotherapy. Factors such as age and severity of lung disease in the participants may affect the results as well as the method of performing each treatment. Overall, the evidence provided by this review for whether PEP reduces flare ups compared to other forms of chest physiotherapy was moderate to high quality, but evidence for other outcomes was of very low to moderate quality, as results were limited. \\n\", '10.1002-14651858.CD013348.pub2-pls.txt': 'Inhibition of blood vessel formation in advanced cervical cancer\\nWhat is the aim of this review?The aim of this Cochrane Review is to find out whether vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) targeting drugs, which inhibit the formation of new blood vessels, can improve survival in women with cervical cancer that has spread to distant sites (metastasised) or has not responded to or come back (recurred) after initial treatment.

CAS is responsible for 8% of all strokes due to a blocked blood vessel (ischemic strokes) and is associated with a high chance of recurrence. In such circumstances, the treatment is to re‐establish adequate blood flow (by surgery or other approaches to open the artery) to prevent further neurologic episodes. Duplex ultrasound (DUS) can help identify the appropriate patients who will benefit from a more invasive treatment and those who should be with drugs alone. \\nWhat is the aim of this review? \\nTo determine how accurate DUS is for diagnosing different grades of CAS in individuals with neurologic symptoms. \\nWhat was studied in the review? \\nDUS is used in clinical practice as the first test to detect carotid artery stenosis, usually with the result confirmed by other more expensive and invasive tests, such as computed tomography angiography (CTA), magnetic resonance angiography (MRA), or digital subtraction angiography (DSA). The advantage of DUS is that it is less expensive and helps to reduce the time required to select patients for treatment. We included studies assessing the accuracy of DUS compared with DSA, MRA, or CTA in patients with recent stroke symptoms.

In many countries, shutting schools was one of the earliest responses. By mid‐April 2020, 192 countries had closed schools, affecting more than 90% of the world’s student population. This severely disrupted school, family and work life, with likely negative impacts including: \\n‐ a worsening of children’s and adolescents’ health and well‐being;‐ increases in inequalities between children and adolescents from disadvantaged and more privileged backgrounds;‐ possible decreased parental income and job security;‐ possible loss of parental economic productivity. \\nGiven the potential negative consequences of school closures, many countries have since reopened schools. To avoid disease transmission among students, between staff and students, and beyond, a range of school‐based measures have been put in place. These include: \\n‐ students and staff wearing face masks and regularly washing their hands;‐ adapting school activities (for example, not singing in music classes);‐ improving ventilation systems; and‐ screening suspected cases of infection. \\nTo date, we know little about which school‐based measures designed to contain COVID‐19 have been evaluated, and how they have been evaluated. It is important to find this out, so that, in time, we can compare the effectiveness of different measures and inform future policy guidelines. \\nWe set out to identify and map the evidence on school‐based measures to contain COVID‐19. This work is intended to form the basis of a future review about the effectiveness of these measures. This review will inform guidelines issued by the World Health Organization (WHO). \\nHow did we identify and map the evidence? \\nFirst, we searched for studies that evaluated any intervention set in schools designed to prevent the spread of COVID‐19. We considered all types of studies, and a broad range of outcomes, including: \\n‐ infectious disease transmission;‐ other harmful or beneficial effects on health;‐ wider implications for society, the economy, and the population. \\nWe then grouped studies according to how similar or different they were. This allowed us to gauge: \\n‐ which types of study have been used to evaluate measures to date;‐ where studies have been conducted;‐ which types of intervention have been evaluated; and‐ which outcomes have been studied. \\nWhat did we find? \\nWe found 42 studies.\\nType of study \\nThirty‐one studies used mathematical modelling designs, to predict the effects of measures on populations. Two studies used experimental designs, in which researchers divide people or settings into groups to compare the effects of different measures. Nine studies used observational designs, in which researchers simply observed the effect of the intervention. \\nStudy setting \\nStudies were conducted in Europe (20 studies), North and South America (13 studies), the West Pacific (6 studies), and the Eastern Mediterranean (1 study). Most studies evaluated measures in more than one school setting (for example, primary education and secondary education). Three studies focused on secondary schools. \\nType of intervention \\nStudies evaluated three broad types of measure:\\n1. Organizational measures to reduce transmission of SARS‐CoV‐2 (36 studies): these included: \\n‐ measures designed to limit risks of disease transmission between people who come into contact with each other (such as face‐masks and physical distancing policies); and‐ measures to reduce opportunities for contact (for example, staggered arrival, break and departure times). \\n2. Structural or environmental measures to reduce transmission of SARS‐CoV‐2 (11 studies): for example, dividing up school playgrounds or improving air circulation. \\n3. Surveillance and response measures to detect SARS‐CoV‐2 infections (19 studies): these included: \\n‐ testing, tracing, and symptom screening; and‐ isolation of confirmed cases or quarantine of suspected cases. \\nOutcomes studied \\nStudies assessed the effects of measures on:\\n‐ SARS‐CoV‐2 transmission (29 studies), including the number of new cases or the average number of people to whom one infected person will pass the virus (reproduction number R);‐ healthcare use (8 studies), for example, the number of hospitalizations;‐ other health outcomes (3 studies), for example, the risk of developing hand eczema (a skin condition); and‐ societal, economic, and other population‐level outcomes (5 studies), including cost. \\nWhat are the implications of our findings? \\nA wide range of school‐based measures designed to contain COVID‐19 have been evaluated to date.

It is the third most common cause of mortality among the cardiovascular diseases, after coronary artery disease and stroke. The advent of multi‐detector computed tomographic pulmonary angiography (CTPA) has allowed better assessment of PE regarding visualisation of the peripheral pulmonary arteries, increasing its rate of diagnosis. More cases of peripheral PEs, such as isolated subsegmental PE (SSPE) and incidental PE, have thereby been identified. These two conditions are usually found in patients with few or no classic symptoms such as coughing (including coughing up blood), chest or upper back pain, acute shortness of breath, or general or specific failure of the circulation that is either cardiac or peripheral in nature. However, in patients with an impaired cardiac and pulmonary condition the classic PE symptoms can be found with isolated SSPEs. Incidental SSPE is found casually in asymptomatic patients, usually by diagnostic imaging performed for other reasons (for example routine computed tomography (CT) for cancer staging in oncologic patients). Patients with isolated SSPE or incidental PE may have a more benign clinical presentation compared to those with proximal PEs.

Perineal trauma can occur spontaneously or result from a surgical incision (episiotomy). Different perineal techniques are being used to slow down the birth of the baby's head, and allow the perineum to stretch slowly to prevent injury. Massage, warm compresses and different perineal management techniques are widely used by midwives and birth attendants. The objective of this updated review was to assess the effect of perineal techniques during the second stage of labour on the incidence of perineal trauma. This is an update of a review that was published in 2011. \\nWhy is this important? \\nTrauma to the perineum can cause pain and other problems for women after the birth. The damage is described as first‐, second‐, third‐ and fourth‐degree tears – first‐degree tears being the least damage and fourth‐degree tears being the most. Third‐ and fourth‐degree tears, affect the anal sphincter or mucosa, thus causing the most problems. Reducing the use of episiotomies will reduce trauma to the perineum. Also, different perineal techniques are being used to slow down the birth of the baby's head. Massage, warm compresses and different perineal management techniques are widely used by midwives and birth attendants. It is important to know if these do indeed reduce trauma and pain for women. \\nWhat evidence did we find? \\nWe searched for studies in September 2016. Twenty two trials were eligible for inclusion in this updated review but only twenty studies (involving 15,181 women), contributed results to the review. The participants in the studies were women without medical complications who were expecting a vaginal birth. The studies varied in their risk of bias, and the quality of the studies was very low to moderate. \\nHands off (or poised) compared to hands on  \\nUsing 'hands off' the perineum resulted in fewer women having an episiotomy (low‐quality evidence), but made no difference to numbers of women with no tears (moderate‐quality evidence), first‐degree tears (low‐quality evidence), second‐degree tears (low‐quality evidence), or third‐ or fourth‐degree tears (very low‐quality evidence). There were considerable unexplained differences in results between the four studies. None of the studies provided data on the number of tears requiring suturing. \\nWarm compresses versus control (hands off or no warm compress)  \\nFewer women in the warm‐compress group experienced third‐ or fourth‐degree tears (moderate‐quality evidence). A warm compress did not affect numbers of women with intact perineum (moderate‐quality evidence), tears requiring suturing (very low‐quality evidence), second‐degree tears (very low‐quality evidence), or episiotomies (low‐quality evidence). It is uncertain whether warm compresses increase or reduce the incidence of first‐degree tears (very low‐quality evidence). \\nMassage versus control (hands off or routine care)  \\nThere were more women with an intact perineum in the perineal massage group (low‐quality evidence), and fewer women with third‐ or fourth‐degree tears (moderate‐quality evidence). Massage did not appear to make a difference to women with perineal trauma requiring suturing (very low‐quality evidence), first‐degree tears (very low‐quality evidence), second‐degree tears (very low‐quality evidence), or episiotomies (very low‐quality evidence). \\nRitgen's manoeuvre versus standard care  \\nOne small study found that women who had Ritgen's manoeuvre had fewer first‐degree tears (very low‐quality evidence), but more second‐degree tears (very low‐quality evidence). There was no difference between groups in terms of the number of third‐ or fourth‐degree tears, or episiotomies (both low‐quality evidence). \\nWhat does this mean? \\nWe found that massage and warm compresses may reduce serious perineal trauma (third‐ and fourth‐degree tears). Hands‐off techniques may reduce the number of episiotomies but it was not clear that these techniques had a beneficial effect on other perineal trauma. There remains uncertainty about the value of other techniques to reduce damage to the perineum during childbirth. \\nMore research is necessary, to evaluate different perineal techniques and to answer questions about how to minimise perineal trauma. There is insufficient evidence on women's experiences and views (only one included study collected information on this). It is important for future research to ascertain whether these interventions are acceptable to women. \\n\", '10.1002-14651858.CD013845.pub2-pls.txt': 'Can a dementia medicine (memantine) help people with autism spectrum disorder?\\nBackgroundAutism spectrum disorder (autism) is a condition that begins in childhood. Core symptoms include persistent difficulties with social communication (e.g. difficulties with back‐and‐forth conversations, communication without words, and in developing and maintaining relationships), and repetitive and restricted interests and behaviours (e.g. repetitive mannerisms, restricted interests and behaviours, resistance to change and sensory sensitivities). Around 1% to 2% of children have autism. Autistic people often have other conditions such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), anxiety, language impairments (e.g. difficulties understanding and using grammar) and intellectual disability. Autism can have negative impacts on quality of life, school achievement and social relationships. Memantine is a medication traditionally used to treat dementia, but some studies suggest that it may decrease core autistic symptoms. If memantine is being used to change the core symptoms of autism, it is important to assess whether it works and is safe. This review combines the research evidence on the use of memantine in autism. \\nReview questionDoes memantine change the core symptoms of autism and related behaviours? \\nSearch dateThe evidence is current to 14 February 2022. \\nStudy characteristicsWe found three studies with 204 people that had evaluated the effectiveness of memantine in autism. All studies were randomised controlled trials, meaning participants were randomly allocated to receive either the treatment or a dummy pill (placebo). This is the best design for assessing the effectiveness of treatments. All three studies included children diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder, with an average age of 9.40 years. We found no studies in adults. The children received memantine (for 12 weeks in two studies and for 24 weeks in one study), and their behaviour was assessed before treatment and immediately after treatment. \\nStudy funding sourcesOne study was sponsored and funded by a laboratory that makes memantine (Forest). The study sponsor helped to design the study, collect information, analyse and interpret the information, and take the decision to publish the results. The authors of the other two smaller studies said they did not receive any funding; though in one of these studies, Forest Pharmaceuticals provided the medicine for free. \\nKey resultsIt is unclear if memantine\\xa0makes any difference to the core symptoms of autism. Additionally, there may be no difference between memantine and placebo in the occurrence of side effects, language ability, memory, adaptive behaviour or the autism‐related behaviours of hyperactivity and irritability. \\nLimitations of the evidenceWe are not confident about the evidence for core symptoms of autism because it comes from only three small studies; because the studies included different types of people and delivered the medicine in different ways; and because the studies did not always provide information about everything we were interested in. Additionally, we have little confidence in the evidence on side effects and language because it comes from only two small studies; and we have little confidence in the evidence on intelligence, memory, adaptive behaviour, hyperactivity and irritability, because it comes from only one small study. \\n', '10.1002-14651858.CD009868.pub3-abstract.txt': 'Fixed‐dose combination drug therapy for the prevention of heart disease and stroke\\nReview question: We reviewed the evidence about the effect of fixed‐dose combination drug therapy on the prevention of heart attacks and strokes.

This report represents an update from a previous review published in 2014. \\nStudy characteristics: The evidence is current to September 2016. Four studies included individuals with a prior heart attack or stroke or with a high predicted risk for having an initial heart attack and five studies had long‐term (12 months or more) follow‐up. The main risk of bias was related to lack of blinding of participants and personnel, which was inherent to the intervention. Most study participants were middle‐aged men with moderate elevations in blood pressure or cholesterol. Two studies specifically included ethnic Aboriginal or Maori minorities in half of the study participants. The fixed‐dose combinations ranged from two to five drugs; all studies included at least one blood pressure‐lowering and one cholesterol‐lowering drug. \\nKey results: The effects of fixed‐dose combination drug therapy on all‐cause mortality and fatal and non‐fatal heart attacks and strokes are uncertain, primarily due to the low number of participants experiencing these events in these studies (fewer than 5% for both) and comparisons with usual care (low‐quality evidence). Fixed‐dose combination drug therapy leads to more adverse events than control (32% versus 27%), including placebo (moderate‐quality evidence). This information is not surprising since aspirin, blood pressure‐lowering drugs and cholesterol drugs are known to increase the risk for side effects compared with placebo. Fixed‐dose combination therapy may modestly lower blood pressure (˜6 mmHg) and cholesterol (‐0.6 mmol/L in LDL cholesterol), but these effects were not consistent (moderate‐quality evidence for blood pressure and LDL cholesterol but low‐quality evidence of total cholesterol). Fixed‐dose combination therapy appears to improve adherence to medications to prevent ASCVD (moderate‐quality evidence). \\nQuality of the evidence: The quality of evidence from these studies generally ranged from moderate to low. Ongoing trials of fixed‐dose combination drug therapy will likely inform clinical endpoints to guide decision‐making. \\n', '10.1002-14651858.CD013817.pub2-pls.txt': 'Rho kinase inhibitors for primary open‐angle glaucoma and ocular hypertension\\nQuestion \\nWhat are the benefits and risks of rho kinase inhibitor eye drops to treat people with either glaucoma or increased eye pressure? \\nKey messages \\nAntiglaucomatous eye drops such as latanoprost and timolol may reduce the eye pressure more compared with treatment with a rho kinase inhibitor, but the difference with timolol is small.

High eye pressure is a known risk factor for developing glaucoma.\\xa0 \\nMedical glaucoma treatment \\nThere are different types of eye drops that can be used to treat glaucoma. All medical treatments of glaucoma work by reducing eye pressure. Latanoprost and timolol are two glaucoma medications, and one of the new types of glaucoma medicine is called a rho kinase inhibitor.\\xa0 \\nWhat did we want to find out? \\nWe wanted to examine whether the effectiveness and safety of rho kinase inhibitor eye drops were better or worse than other medicines. \\nWhat did we do? \\nWe searched for studies that compared:\\n‐ rho kinase inhibitor with placebo (a treatment with no therapeutic effect);\\n‐ rho kinase inhibitor with other types of glaucoma treatments (latanoprost and timolol).\\nSearch date\\xa0 \\nWe searched medical databases on 11 December 2020.\\nWhat did we find? \\nWe found 17 studies examining 4953 people aged at least 18 years diagnosed with primary open‐angle glaucoma or high eye pressure and treated with a rho kinase inhibitor. The studies varied in treatment duration from 24 hours to 12 months. They were conducted in the USA, Canada and Japan. Of the studies, 16 \\xa0were funded by pharmaceutical companies and one did not provide information about potential funding sources. The effect of treatment was evaluated by measuring the eye pressure and assessing the adverse events of treatment. \\nThe studies did not report data disease progression, but they reported data on the lowering of the pressure within the eye and adverse events. Treatment with latanoprost may be better than rho kinase inhibitor. Treatment with timolol may be slightly better than treatment with rho kinase inhibitor. Furthermore, treatment with both rho kinase inhibitor and latanoprost or timolol probably reduces the eye pressure even more. Overall, the studies reported adverse events very differently. More people treated with rho kinase inhibitors may have experienced eye‐related adverse events; however, we are not very certain about these findings. There were no serious adverse events reported for treatment with rho kinase inhibitor. \\nMain limitations of the evidence \\nThe studies did not report all the outcomes that we were interested in. The studies focused on specific outcomes such as eye pressure and adverse events, whereas we wanted to answer other questions as well. The current evidence was based on few studies. Some studies were conducted in a way that may have introduced errors into the results. Studies varied in the way they measured the outcomes and thus may not be comparable to each other.\\xa0 \\n', '10.1002-14651858.CD012129.pub3-abstract.txt': \"Aspirin (single dose) for relief of perineal pain after childbirth\\nWhat is the issue? \\nCan aspirin be given to women who experience perineal pain following childbirth to relieve the pain, without causing side effects for either the women or their babies? \\nWhy is this important? \\nMany women experience pain in the perineum (the area between the vagina and anus) following childbirth. The perineum may be bruised or torn during childbirth, or have a cut made to help the baby to be born (an episiotomy). After childbirth, perineal pain can interfere with women's ability to care for their newborns and establish breastfeeding. If perineal pain is not relieved effectively, longer‐term problems for women may include painful sexual intercourse, pelvic floor problems resulting in incontinence, prolapse, or chronic perineal pain. Aspirin may be given to women who have perineal pain after childbirth, but its effectiveness and safety had not been assessed in a systematic review. This is an update of a review last published in 2017. This is part of a series of reviews looking at drugs to help relieve perineal pain in first few weeks after childbirth. \\nWhat evidence did we find? \\nWe searched for evidence in October 2019, and included 17 randomised controlled studies, involving 1132 women, published between 1967 and 1997. All women had perineal pain following an episiotomy (usually within 48 hours after birth), and were not breastfeeding. The women received either aspirin (doses ranging from 300 mg to 1200 mg) or fake pills (placebo), by mouth. The methodological quality of the studies was often unclear. Two studies did not contribute any data for analyses. \\nAspirin compared with placebo may increase adequate pain relief for mothers four to eight hours after administration (low‐certainty evidence). It is uncertain whether aspirin compared with placebo has an effect on the need for additional pain relief, or on adverse effects for mothers, in the four to eight hours after administration (both very low‐certainty evidence). \\nThe effects of administering 300 mg versus 600 mg aspirin (1 study), 600 mg versus 1200 mg aspirin (2 studies), or 300 mg versus 1200 mg aspirin (1 study) are uncertain for adequate pain relief, the need for additional pain relief, or adverse effects for the mother. \\nNo studies reported on adverse effects of aspirin for the baby, or other outcomes we planned to assess: prolonged hospital stay, or readmission to hospital due to perineal pain; perineal pain six weeks after childbirth, women's views, or postpartum depression. \\nWhat does this mean? \\nA single dose of aspirin may help with perineal pain following episiotomy for women who are not breastfeeding, when measured four to eight hours after administration. \\nWe found no information to assess the effects of aspirin for women who are breastfeeding.\\n\", '10.1002-14651858.CD013761.pub2-pls.txt': \"What are the benefits and risks of beds, mattresses and overlays for preventing and treating pressure ulcers? \\nThe overview presents a lot of data from randomised controlled trials and contains an advanced analysis called 'network meta‐analysis'.

People who have mobility problems or who lie in bed for long periods are at risk of developing pressure ulcers. \\nWhat did we want to find out? \\nThere are many types of beds, mattresses and overlays specifically designed for people with pressure ulcers. These can be made from a range of materials (such as foam, air cells and gel pads) and are divided into two groups: \\n‐ reactive (static) surfaces that apply a constant pressure to the skin; and\\n‐ active (alternating pressure) surfaces that regularly redistribute the pressure under the body. \\nWe wanted to find out if different types of reactive and active surfaces:\\n‐ prevent pressure ulcers;\\n‐ help ulcers to heal;\\n‐ are comfortable and improve people’s quality of life;\\n‐ have health benefits that outweigh their costs; and\\n‐ have any unwanted effects.\\nWe also wanted to find out what the best treatment options are for either preventing or healing pressure ulcers. \\nWhat did we do? \\nWe searched for Cochrane Reviews that summarised the results of all available carefully designed studies (controlled trials) evaluating different beds, mattresses and overlays in preventing and treating pressure ulcers. A Cochrane Review provides a high level of evidence on the effectiveness of healthcare interventions. We summarised the results of these reviews in a single document (called an overview of reviews). \\nWe also collected studies included in these reviews and compared all available treatments at the same time in a single analysis (called network meta‐analysis). We then summarised these results, and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes. \\nWhat did we find? \\nEffects in preventing pressure ulcers  \\nWe found four reviews on the use of beds, mattresses and overlays for preventing pressure ulcers. From these, we included 40 studies (12,517 people) in a network meta‐analysis evaluating reduction of pressure ulcer risk. The network meta‐analysis evidence suggests that static (reactive) air overlays, alternating pressure air mattresses, and (reactive) gel pads used on operating tables may reduce pressure ulcer risk compared with foam mattresses. \\nWe also included 10 studies (7211 people) in a network meta‐analysis evaluating the time taken for new ulcers to develop.

From these, we included four studies (397 people) in a network meta‐analysis. The network meta‐analysis evidence suggests that more people with ulcers may heal completely using reactive air surfaces than foam surfaces. \\nThe overview evidence suggests that, if the time needed to completely heal an ulcer is looked at, reactive air surfaces may improve the chances of pressure ulcers healing when compared with foam mattresses. \\nHowever, it is unclear which treatment is best for either preventing or treating pressure ulcers. \\nOther effects in preventing and treating pressure ulcers  \\nThe overview evidence suggests that:\\n‐ compared with foam mattresses, alternating pressure air surfaces probably result in health benefits that outweigh their costs in preventing pressure ulcers; \\n‐ reactive air‐filled surfaces may cost more than foam mattresses in healing ulcers; and \\n‐ the other benefits and risks of these beds, mattresses and mattress overlays are unclear. \\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence? \\nAlthough the reviews we found used reliable methods, most of the studies in them were small and used methods likely to introduce errors in their results. \\nHow up‐to‐date is this evidence? \\nThe evidence in this overview is current to July 2020.\\n\", '10.1002-14651858.CD013699-pls.txt': 'Are digital contact tracing technologies effective during infectious disease outbreaks?\\nWhy is this question important? \\nThe global COVID‐19 pandemic highlights the importance of accurate and timely contact tracing. Contact tracing tells people that they may have been near someone with ‐ or showing symptoms of ‐ an infectious disease, allowing them to self‐isolate and helping to stop the spread of infection. Traditionally, contact tracing begins with notification that someone has an infectious disease. They are asked to recall their contacts, going back two to three days before symptom onset. This is time‐consuming and may not always give a complete picture, so digital aids could help contact tracers. \\nDigital contact tracing uses technology to track and trace contacts. Individuals download an app onto their smartphones and record location and symptom information, or their devices might use location‐finding technology, like Bluetooth or GPS (global positioning system). If the user is infected, the technology identifies close contacts and/or secondary infections (people to whom they passed the disease), and informs people whom they have been near. The technology identifies where the infection was passed on and its duration (the context). \\nHowever, problems may occur where access to technology is limited, in low‐income settings or for elderly people, for example. Also, some people see it as an invasion of privacy and are suspicious of how their data will be used. \\nWe wanted to know whether digital contact tracing, compared to manual contact tracing, is effective in reducing the spread of infection, as measured by secondary infections, identifying close contacts, tracing a complete set of contacts, and identifying the context of infection. \\nWhat did we do? \\nWe searched medical databases for studies that assessed digital contact tracing. We preferred studies set during infectious disease outbreaks, which assessed real people in real time, but we included studies in any setting and of any design. \\nTo answer our question quickly, we shortened some steps of the Cochrane review process, however, we are confident in our conclusions. \\nWhat we found \\nWe found 12 relevant studies. Six assessed the effectiveness of digital contact tracing on specific groups (cohorts) of people: three during an outbreak (Ebola in Sierra Leone; tuberculosis in Botswana; and whooping cough (pertussis) in USA); and three replicated an outbreak in schools to assess systems for identifying close contacts of participants. The remaining six were modelling studies, which simulated digital contact tracing. \\nMain results \\nDigital contact tracing with self‐isolation probably reduces the number of secondary infections, but not as much as manual contact tracing with self‐isolation (2 modelling studies). \\nDigital contact tracing found more close contacts in two outbreaks than manual (2 studies in USA and Sierra Leone). Devices in non‐outbreak settings can identify more close contacts than self‐reported diaries or surveys. \\nAn app may reduce the time to complete a set of close contacts (1 study). Digital systems were faster to use than paper systems for recording new contacts and monitoring known contacts, and possibly less prone to data loss. \\nProblems with system access (2 studies) included patchy network coverage, lack of data, technical problems and higher staff training needs. Contact tracers\\' personal expenses increased (1 study) due to travel and recharging phone batteries. Devices all appeared to protect diagnosed users from contacts, snoopers and authorities but one app\\'s users were members of public health agencies. Studies recorded stolen hardware (second‐hand mobile phones); reported that paper forms were \"often lost\", and that digital data were password protected (2 studies) and encrypted (1 study). \\nWe found no evidence on contextual information and acceptability.\\nWhat this means \\nIt is unlikely that digital technologies would be the sole method of contact tracing during an outbreak; they would probably be used alongside manual methods. Unfortunately, the technology is largely unproven in real‐world outbreak settings and none of our included studies assessed digital plus manual contact tracing with digital contact tracing alone. Our included studies assessed different technologies and used different methods from each other, so we are uncertain about their evidence. \\nGovernments that implement digital contact tracing should ensure that at‐risk populations are not disadvantaged and take privacy concerns into account. \\nThis review is up to date to May 2020.\\n', '10.1002-14651858.CD013487-pls.txt': 'Multiple drug combinations of bortezomib, lenalidomide and thalidomide for initial treatment of adults with transplant‐ineligible multiple myeloma \\nBackground \\nMultiple myeloma is a type of blood cancer. It accounts for approximately 2% of all cancers and is still considered incurable. For people with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma (NDMM), who are unsuitable for a procedure where damaged blood cells are replaced with healthy ones (stem‐cell transplant), treatment is usually a multiple drug combination of bortezomib, lenalidomide, or thalidomide, plus melphalan and prednisolone (MP) or dexamethasone (D). Multiple drug combinations are approved for initial anti‐myeloma therapy, however, access to these medicines is restricted in many countries worldwide. \\nAim of the review \\nTo compare the benefits and harms of selected anti‐myeloma drugs (bortezomib (V), lenalidomide (R), thalidomide (T)) for transplant‐unsuitable NDMM. \\nStudy characteristics \\nWe searched selected medical databases and trial registries until 14th February 2019. We included studies comparing multiple drug combinations of V, R, and T for the treatment of people with NDMM who were unsuitable for a stem‐cell transplant. We differentiated between fixed treatment duration and continuous therapy. Fixed therapy is a pre‐specified number of cycles, while a continuous therapy is given until the disease gets worse, the person finds the drug hard to tolerate, or when the treatment is given for a prolonged period. Continuous therapies are indicated with a \"c\". \\nKey results \\nWe identified 25 studies involving 11,403 transplant‐unsuitable adults with NDMM, and comparing 21 different treatment regimens. \\nSurvival \\nPeople who had the standard treatment, MP, lived for an average of 35 months. People treated with RD, TMP, and VRDc probably live for much longer (moderate certainty). Treatment with VMP may also lead to much longer survival, compared to MP (low certainty). People treated with RD lived for an additional 20.4 months; with TMP an additional 11.6 months; with VRDc an additional 36.2 months, and with VMP an additional 14.9 months. \\nHarms \\nOn average, 0.9% (9 out of 1000) of people treated with MP experienced peripheral nerve damage (polyneuropathies).The evidence was inconclusive whether treatment with RD decreases the risk of developing a polyneuropathy, compared to MP. The estimated risk of polyneuropathies with RD was 0.5%. Treatment with TMP and VMP probably increases the risk of experiencing polyneuropathies compared to MP (moderate certainty). The estimated risk with TMP was 4.0%, and with VMP 79.4%. No VRDc treatment study reported the number of participants with severe polyneuropathies. \\nOn average, 36.1% (361 out of 1000) of people on MP‐treatment experienced at least one serious adverse event (SAE). VMP probably increases the proportion of participants with SAEs compared to MP to 46.2% (moderate certainty). \\nOn average, 9.2% (92 out of 1000) of people treated with MP stop the treatment because of adverse events (AEs). Treatment with RD, TMP, and VRDc leads to a much higher proportion of people stopping treatment because of AEs than MP (high certainty). The risk of stopping treatment with RD is 38.5%; with TMP 37.7%, with VRDc 82.1%. Treatment with VMP probably increases the risk of stopping treatment because of AEs compared to MP (9.75%, moderate certainty). \\nQuality of life \\nQuality of life (QoL) was reported in four studies for seven different treatments and was measured with four different tools. Assessment and reporting differed between studies and could not be meta‐analysed. However, all studies reported an improvement in QoL after anti‐myeloma treatment was started for all assessed treatments. \\nConclusions \\nVRDc showed the highest overall survival benefits, compared to MP. RD and TMP also improved OS compared to MP. However, these combinations of drugs also led to more adverse events compared to MP, and led to more people stopping treatment. More trials are needed that look carefully at both harms and QoL. \\n', '10.1002-14651858.CD013198.pub2-pls.txt': 'Prophylactic antibiotics for people with COPD\\nReview question \\nWhich preventative antibiotic is effective and safe for reducing exacerbations, improving quality of life, and reducing serious side effects in people with COPD? \\nWhat is COPD? \\nCOPD is a lung condition that can cause long‐term breathing problems. Symptoms include shortness of breath, cough, and sputum production. Flare‐ups (so‐called exacerbations) can be triggered by infection or inflammation, causing worsening symptoms and lung damage. Frequent exacerbations can lead to reduced quality of life and can increase the risk of death. \\nWhy did we do this review? \\nWe wanted to find out if one type of preventative antibiotic was better than another in reducing exacerbations, improving quality of life, and reducing side effects. We did this by using information from two previous reviews and comparing different antibiotics with each other, and with a control treatment (called placebo), by creating networks. As information was limited, the networks allowed us to combine information and determine the best preventative antibiotics by ranking them in order of ability to reduce exacerbations, improve quality of life, and reduce serious side effects. \\nWhat evidence did we find? \\nWe tested three types of antibiotics: macrolides, quinolones, and tetracyclines. Macrolides were better in reducing exacerbations compared to control treatment. There was no clear difference in exacerbations when quinolone or tetracycline was compared with a control treatment. Tetracyclines were ranked lower than placebo in reducing exacerbations. We used the data for each antibiotic group to rank antibiotic groups in order of their ability to reduce exacerbations. We found that macrolides ranked first, followed by quinolones (second). Tetracyclines were ranked fourth and were not better than control treatment (ranked third). \\nMacrolides improved quality of life compared with control treatment. Quinolones did not appear to impact quality of life, and tetracyclines may have been associated with worsening quality of life compared to control treatment. \\nMacrolides were more effective in reducing serious unwanted events. There was no clear benefit for serious unwanted events with quinolone, tetracycline, or combined macrolide plus tetracycline compared with control treatment. \\nWe could not clearly show benefit or harm of preventative antibiotic use for microbial resistance. \\nQuality of the evidence \\nWe did not find any concerns about the ways in which studies were carried out, except that for some studies, people collecting the information knew (1) which patient was included in which treatment group, and (2) patient results when treatments were completed. Overall, the numerical information was robust and was unlikely to be influenced by differences noted between individual studies. \\nConclusion \\nWe found that exacerbations were reduced, quality of life was improved, and unwanted events were fewer with macrolides compared with control treatment. We could not determine whether quinolones or tetracyclines were of benefit compared with control treatment. Macrolides were ranked highest, followed by quinolones, which ranked second. Tetracyclines were no better than control treatment (ranked fourth and third, respectively). Although these NMAs show some benefit of using macrolides, they are based on a limited number of studies, and concerns remain about antibiotic resistance with long‐term use of antibiotics. \\n', '10.1002-14651858.CD008288.pub2-abstract.txt': \"Ayurvedic treatments for diabetes mellitus:\\nPeople with diabetes and other chronic diseases often use complementary and alternative medicines. This review examines the efficacy and safety of the use of various Ayurvedic treatments for diabetes mellitus. We found seven trials which included 354 participants (172 on treatment, 158 on control, 24 could not be classified). All these studies included adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Six studies tested five different types of herbal mixtures (proprietary drugs) and only one tested 'whole system' Ayurvedic treatment. The duration of treatment ranged from three to six months. One study each of Diabecon, Inolter and Cogent DB (proprietary herbal mixtures) found significantly lower glycosylated haemoglobin A1c (HbA1C) levels at the end of the treatment period compared to controls. Two studies of Diabecon, and one study of Cogent DB (proprietary herbal mixtures) found significantly lower fasting blood sugar levels at the end of the study period in the treatment group. No deaths were observed in these trials and side effects did not differ significantly between intervention and control groups. One study of Pancreas tonic reported no significant change in health‐related quality of life. No study reported on or was designed to investigate diabetic complications, death from any cause and costs. Despite positive results in some studies, and absence of serious side effects, firm conclusions cannot be drawn due to weak methods and small number of participants in the evaluated studies. Further research is needed to assess the efficacy of these treatments. Ayurvedic physicians generally use a mixture of various herbs or proprietary preparations along with diet, exercise and mode of living.

We included people with a break just below the ball and socket joint. These types of broken hip are common in older adults whose bones may be fragile because of a condition called osteoporosis. They often happen after a fall from a standing or sitting position. A common way of mending this break is to fix the broken parts of bone with metal implants. During an operation, the surgeon may insert a smooth pin or screw through the two parts of broken bone. A smooth pin is not threaded like a screw but may have extra features such as a fold‐out hook. Alternatively, the surgeon may use a 'fixed angle plate' which sits on the outer edge of the broken bone and is attached to the bone with screws or pins. \\nSearch date \\nWe searched for RCTs (clinical studies where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups), and quasi‐RCTs (in which people are put into groups by a method which is not randomised, such as date of birth or hospital record number), published up to 6 July 2020. \\nStudy characteristics \\nWe included 38 studies, involving 8585 adults with 8590\\xa0hip fractures. The average age of study participants ranged from 60 to 84 years; 73% were women, which is usual for people who have this type of hip fracture. \\nKey results \\nSmooth pins compared with fixed angle plates (four studies, 1313 participants): we are uncertain whether there is a difference between these implants in improving a person's ability to walk independently (with no more than one walking stick), in the number of people who die early (within four months of surgery) or up to 12 months after surgery, and in how many people need additional surgery (e.g. because of deep infection around the implant). \\nScrews compared with fixed angle plates (11 studies, 2471 participants): we found no evidence of difference between these implants in hip function (ability to use the hip), health‐related quality of life (HRQoL), death at 12 months, and additional surgery. We are uncertain whether there is a difference between these implants in independent walking, and early deaths. \\nScrews compared to smooth pins (seven studies, 1119 participants): we found no evidence of difference between these implants in deaths at 12 months. We are uncertain whether there is a difference between these implants in early deaths and additional surgery. \\nScrews or pins compared with fixed angle plates (15 studies, 3784 participants): we found no evidence of difference between these implants in deaths at 12 months, or additional surgery. We are uncertain whether there is a difference between implants in independent walking and early death. We found no additional evidence for hip function or HRQoL. \\nNo studies in the review reported activities of daily living or delirium.\\nCertainty of the evidence \\nAlthough there were some large studies, most of the evidence for each outcome came from only a few participants. Many older studies were not well reported. It was not possible to hide from the surgeons what type of fixing was used, which might affect a surgeon's decision on whether someone needed additional surgery. Sometimes, we found differences between the findings of individual studies that we could not explain. \\nFor these reasons, we assessed the evidence for the outcomes as either low‐ or very low‐certainty evidence. This means we had limited confidence or very little confidence in the results. \\nConclusions \\nThere may be little or no difference between screws and fixed angle plates in hip function, HRQoL, deaths at 12 months, and additional surgery, and between screws and pins in deaths at 12 months. But we are uncertain of the effects for other outcomes, including those for smooth pins versus fixed angle plates, because the evidence was very low‐certainty.

This condition is associated with death, serious infection, and long‐term disability, as well as developmental problems. \\nWhat did we want to find out? \\nOne way to help prevent necrotising enterocolitis may be to add synbiotics (combinations of probiotic bacteria or yeasts plus non‐digestible sugars to support probiotic growth and colonisation) to milk feeds. We wanted to find out whether synbiotics might benefit very preterm and very low birth weight infants. Our outcomes of interest included necrotising enterocolitis, death from any cause, serious infection, duration of hospitalisation since birth and neurodevelopmental outcomes. \\nWhat did we do? \\nFor our Cochrane Review, we searched several important databases to identify randomized controlled trials that investigated the use of synbiotics for preventing necrotising enterocolitis in very preterm and very low birth weight infants. We used standard Cochrane methods to conduct our review and perform our analyses. We used the GRADE approach to assess the certainty of the evidence for each outcome. \\nWhat did we find? \\nWe found six trials with a total of 925 infant participants. Trials were mostly small, and most had design flaws that might have biased their findings. \\nMain results \\nCombined analyses showed that giving synbiotics to very preterm or very low birth weight infants may reduce the risk of necrotising enterocolitis and death. Synbiotics may have little or no effect in reducing the risk of serious infection, but the evidence is very uncertain. None of the studies that we identified assessed the effect of synbiotics on disability or developmental outcomes. \\nWhat are the limitations of this evidence? \\nAlthough the evidence from randomised controlled trials can potentially be of high certainty, the methods used in our review's included trials may have introduced biases that exaggerated the benefits of giving synbiotics to very preterm and very low birth weight infants. Also, because most of the trials were small, the effect estimates for some outcomes were imprecise. For these reasons, we graded down the certainty of the evidence.

It can be difficult to feed babies enough nutritious food when they have this condition, and there is evidence of delayed development in children born with cleft. \\nThis review aimed to compare the effects of different feeding interventions such as maternal advice and support, modified bottles and/or teats, obturating or maxillary plates (plates placed in the roof of the mouth to artificially close the cleft palate) and supplemental breastfeeding in babies with cleft lip and/or palate prior to, or following, closure. Interventions in the first 6 months from term and used with breast milk or formula feeding only were considered, but outcomes (measures of growth, development and parental satisfaction) may have been measured at any time including adulthood. \\nMaternal advice and support on feeding techniques and breastfeeding positions are often provided, but no studies evaluated the effectiveness of this intervention. Squeezable rather than rigid bottles may be easier to use for feeding babies with cleft lip and/or palate, and breastfeeding may have growth advantages over spoon‐feeding following cleft lip surgery. Only five studies (including 292 babies) compared the effects of feeding interventions in babies with cleft lip and/or palate on growth, development or parental satisfaction. Evidence for breastfeeding rather than spoon‐feeding following surgery was weak and there was a suggestion that squeezable bottles may be more manageable than rigid ones. No evidence was found to support the use of maxillary plates in babies with unilateral clefts and no studies assessed the effects of maternal advice or support.

Also, none of the included tests was a true POC test conducted at the patient's side: half of the included studies (n = 10) evaluated POC tests in onsite laboratories near the patient, and the other half were tests with POC platforms evaluated in a central or reference laboratory (n = 10). \\nTo whom do the results of this review apply? \\nPLHIV with suspected high viral loads attending healthcare facilities.\\nWhat are the implications of this review? \\nIn theory, for a population of 1000 PLHIV where 100 have high virus levels, 136 people would receive a positive result with the molecular POC test; of these, 39 will not have high viral levels (false‐positive result) and would be incorrectly identified as not responding to ART treatment, possibly leading to unnecessary testing or further treatment; and 864 would receive a negative test result with the molecular POC test; of these, three will actually have high virus levels (false‐negative result) and would be missed whilst failing ART treatment. \\nHow up‐to‐date is this review? \\nThe evidence is current to 23 November 2020.\\n\", '10.1002-14651858.CD013757.pub2-pls.txt': 'Palivizumab for respiratory syncytial virus infection prevention in children\\nReview question \\nWhat are the effects (benefits and harms) of palivizumab\\xa0for preventing severe respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection in children? \\nBackground \\nRSV is the\\xa0main cause\\xa0of\\xa0acute respiratory infections in children,\\xa0mainly during the first year of life, accounting for 33.1 million infections a year with an estimated 90.6% of these episodes occurring in low‐ and middle‐income countries.

The authors collected and analysed all relevant studies to answer this question and found 25 randomised controlled trials (participants receive the treatment based on method similar to coin toss or lottery; this is to ensure that the people who receive the different treatments are similar in all aspects except the treatment, so that any differences in the results between the treatments can be attributed to the treatment rather than differences in the type of people who received the treatment). During analysis of data, authors used standard Cochrane techniques, which allows comparison of two treatments at a time. Authors also used advanced techniques, that allow comparison of many treatments at the same time (usually referred as 'network meta‐analysis' or 'multiple treatment comparisons'). The aim is to gather reliable evidence on the relative benefits and harms of the different treatments. \\nDate of literature search December 2018 \\nKey messages Only two studies were conducted well. The remaining studies had one or more flaws. Therefore, there is high uncertainty in the results of the analysis. The authors could not recommend one treatment over another on the basis of risk of death, serious complications, percentage of people who developed any complication, percentage of participants who underwent liver transplantation (replacement of a diseased liver with a healthy one), or the number of other liver failure events. Health‐related quality of life was not reported in any of the trials. The number of complications of any severity was lower with albumin plus noradrenaline than albumin plus terlipressin.

People were administered different treatments. The review authors excluded studies with liver‐transplanted participants. Participants age, when reported, ranged from 42 to 60 years. The number of females ranged from 6 to 62 out of 100 in the studies that reported this information. The main treatments compared were albumin alone, albumin plus terlipressin, and albumin plus noradrenaline.

Study data were sparse. Twenty‐three studies with 1185 participants provided data for analyses. The follow‐up in the trials ranged from one week to six months. The review shows that: \\n‐ About 60 out of every 100 people died within three months, and 35 out of every 100 people recovered from hepatorenal syndrome. \\n‐ The provided treatment may make no difference to the percentage of people who died or developed serious complications, number of serious complications per person, percentage of people who developed complications of any severity, or the percentage of people undergoing liver transplantation. \\n‐ None of the trials reported health‐related quality of life.\\n‐ The number of complications of any severity was lower with albumin plus noradrenaline than albumin plus terlipressin. \\n‐ Recovery from hepatorenal syndrome may be lower with albumin plus midodrine plus octreotide and albumin alone than albumin plus terlipressin and albumin plus noradrenaline. \\n‐ We have very low confidence in the overall results.\\n‐ Future trials with proper design and quality are needed to clarify the best treatment for people with advanced liver disease having hepatorenal syndrome. \\n\", '10.1002-14651858.CD012979.pub3-abstract.txt': 'Medical interventions for chronic inflammation of the nose and sinuses in cystic fibrosis\\nReview question \\nWhat are the effects of medical interventions for chronic rhinosinusitis on people with cystic fibrosis? \\nBackground \\nChronic rhinosinusitis is long‐term infection and inflammation of the nasal cavity and air‐filled spaces around the eyes and nose. Cystic fibrosis is a genetic condition that makes secretions in the body thick, and hence stagnant. When this occurs in and around the nose, it causes chronic rhinosinusitis. Better care of people with cystic fibrosis has led to them living longer, increasing the chance of developing chronic rhinosinusitis. Early and effective interventions with antibiotics, steroids, drugs that thin the mucus (e.g. dornase alfa) and drugs to improve how the cell membrane channel functions (CFTR modulators) can help to improve quality of life and prevent the development of lower airway disease. Currently, there are no guidelines based on trials to know how best to treat chronic rhinosinusitis in people with cystic fibrosis. \\nSearch date \\nThe evidence is current to: 09 September 2021.\\nStudy characteristics \\nWe found no trials in our search that met our inclusion criteria. We have listed 12 trials as excluded and one trial as ongoing in the current review. \\nKey results \\nAlthough chronic rhinosinusitis is common in people with cystic fibrosis, there is not enough evidence available on its management.

Individuals who experience frequent or severe headaches may benefit from medications taken before the pain starts. Two classes of medication, the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin‐norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), typically used to treat depression, are evaluated in this review. \\nThis is an update of a previous review that included studies on migraine and tension‐type headache. The original review has been split into two separate reviews: this update addresses only studies on tension‐type headache, while a second focuses on migraine. When we updated this review (November 2014), we identified two new studies. Six studies were already included in the previous version of the review. Overall, we analysed a total of 412 adults participants. All the studies had a small number of participants and were conducted over a period of two to four months. Only a few were of high quality. \\nResults suggest that SSRIs or SNRIs are no better than placebo (sugar pill) in reducing the number of days with tension‐type headache. There were no differences in minor side effects between participants treated with SSRIs or SNRIs versus those treated with placebo. SSRIs and SNRIs do not seem to offer advantages when compared to other active treatments, specifically the tricyclic antidepressant, amitriptyline. The participants treated with SSRIs or SNRIs suffered fewer minor side effects than those who took amitriptyline, however the number of people who stopped taking one drug or the other due to side effects was approximately equal. These results are based on poor quality, small, short‐term trials (no more than four months). We did not find a study comparing SSRIs or SNRIs with other medications (e.g. botulinum toxin) or non‐drug therapies (e.g. psycho‐behavioural treatments, manual therapy, acupuncture). \\n\", '10.1002-14651858.CD013079.pub3-abstract.txt': 'Antibiotic treatments for long‐term Burkholderia cepacia infections in people with cystic fibrosis \\nReview question \\nWe reviewed the evidence for long‐term antibiotic treatments for people with cystic fibrosis who are infected with Burkholderia cepacia complex (bacteria composed of at least 20 different species). \\nBackground \\nPeople with cystic fibrosis often suffer from repeated chest infections and eventually their lungs become permanently infected by bacteria, such as a family of bacteria called Burkholderia cepacia complex which can cause problems because many antibiotics do not work against them and they can cause a quicker deterioration in lung disease. We wanted to discover whether using long‐term antibiotic treatment was beneficial for people with cystic fibrosis and Burkholderia cepacia complex infection. \\nSearch date \\nThe evidence is current to: 12 April 2021.\\nStudy characteristics \\nThis review included one study of 100 people aged between 6 and 57 years old.

The study lasted 52 weeks. \\nKey results \\nThe only study included in this review found inhaled aztreonam had no beneficial effect on lung function or rates of chest infections in people with cystic fibrosis and Burkholderia cepacia complex infection. There was no difference between groups in relation to the average time to the next exacerbation or the number of people hospitalised for an exacerbation. Overall adverse events were similar between groups and with regards to other outcomes assessed, there was no difference between treatment groups for mortality, quality of life or sputum density.

Not recognising a melanoma (a false negative test result) could delay seeking appropriate advice and surgery to remove it. This increases the risk of the cancer spreading to other organs in the body and possibly causing death. Diagnosing a skin lesion as a melanoma when it is not present (a false positive result) may cause anxiety and lead to unnecessary surgery and further investigations. \\nWhat was studied in the review? \\nSpecialised applications ('apps') that provide advice on skin lesions or moles that might cause people concern are widely available for smartphones. Some apps allow people to photograph any skin lesion they might be worried about and then receive guidance on whether to get medical advice. Apps may automatically classify lesions as high or low risk, while others can act as store‐and‐forward devices where images are sent to an experienced professional, such as a dermatologist, who then makes a risk assessment based on the photo. Cochrane researchers found two studies, evaluating five apps that used automated analysis of images and one that used a store‐and‐forward approach, to evaluate suspicious skin lesions. \\nWhat are the main results of the review? \\nThe review included two studies with 332 lesions, including 86 melanomas, analysed by at least one smartphone application. Both studies used photographs of moles or skin lesions that were about to be removed because doctors had already decided they could be melanomas. The photographs were taken by doctors instead of people taking pictures of their lesions with their own smartphones. For these reasons, we are not able to make a reliable estimate about how well the apps actually work. \\nFour apps that produce an immediate (automated) assessment of a skin lesion or mole that has been photographed by the smartphone missed between 7 and 55 melanomas. \\nOne app that sends the photograph of a mole or skin lesion to a dermatologist for assessment missed only one melanoma. Another 6 melanomas examined by the dermatologist via the application were not classified as high risk; instead the dermatologist was not able to classify the lesion as either 'atypical' (possibly a melanoma) or 'typical' (definitely not a melanoma). \\nHow reliable are the results of the studies of this review? \\nThe small number and poor quality of included studies reduces the reliability of findings. The people included were not typical of those who would use the applications in real life. The final diagnosis of melanoma was made by histology, which is likely to have been a reliable method for deciding whether patients really had melanoma*. However, the studies excluded between 2% and 18% of images because the applications failed to produce a recommendation. \\nWho do the results of this review apply to? \\nStudies took place in the USA and Germany. They did not report key patient information such as age and gender. The percentage of people with a final diagnosis of melanoma was 18% and 35%, much higher than that observed in community settings. The definition of eligible patients was narrow in comparison to likely users of the applications. The photographs used were taken by doctors rather than by smartphone users, which seriously impacts the applicability of results. \\nWhat are the implications of this review? \\nCurrent smartphone applications using automated analysis are observed to have a high chance of missing melanomas (false negatives). Store‐and‐forward image applications could have a potential role in the timely identification of people with potentially malignant lesions by facilitating early engagement of those with suspicious skin lesions, but they have resource and workload implications. \\nThe development of applications to help identify people who might have melanoma is a fast‐moving field. The emergence of new applications, higher quality and better reported studies could change the conclusions of this review substantially. \\nHow up‐to‐date is this review? \\nThe review authors searched for and used studies published up to August 2016.\\n*In these studies biopsy was the reference standard (means of establishing final diagnoses).\\n\", '10.1002-14651858.CD013495.pub2-pls.txt': 'Stopping long‐term antidepressants in people with depression or anxiety\\nReview question \\nWe aimed to find out if it is effective and safe to stop antidepressants for people with depression or anxiety who have been taking them for six months or longer. \\nWe compared different approaches for stopping long‐term antidepressants versus continuation. We looked at benefits (e.g. successful discontinuation rate) and harms, such as return of the depressive or anxiety episode (relapse), side effects, and withdrawal symptoms (i.e. symptoms people experience when stopping an antidepressant). \\nBackground \\nAntidepressants are widely used for depression and anxiety. Guidelines recommend that an antidepressant should be continued for at least six months after people start to feel better, and for at least two years if they have had two or more periods of depression. Many people take antidepressants\\xa0for much longer, and as they can cause unpleasant side effects, long‐term use puts people at risk of harm that may outweigh the benefits. \\nStudy characteristics \\nOur search up until January 2020 found 33 studies, which included 4995 adult participants. Most people in these studies had recurrent depression (two or more episodes of depression before stopping antidepressants), and most were recruited from specialist mental healthcare services. In 13 studies, the antidepressant was stopped abruptly; in 18 studies, the antidepressant was stopped gradually over several weeks (\"tapering\"); in four studies, psychological therapy support was also offered; and in one study, stopping was prompted by a letter to the GP with guidance on tapering. Most tapering schemes lasted four weeks or less. \\nKey results \\nWe found very low‐certainty evidence suggesting that abrupt stopping may lead to higher risk of relapse and there was insufficient evidence of its effect on occurrence of side effects compared to continuation of the antidepressant. \\nWe found very low‐certainty evidence suggesting that \"tapering\" over a few weeks may lead to higher risk of a return and again may have little or no effect on side effects compared to continuation. \\nWe found evidence of very low to low certainty to suggest that stopping the antidepressant in combination with providing preventive cognitive therapy (PCT), or MBCT, was possible for 40% to 75% of participants in the group tapering the antidepressant and may show no difference in effects on relapse. \\nWe found low‐certainty evidence suggesting that a prompt letter and guidance on tapering sent to the GP may have no effect on the number of people who stop their antidepressant. \\nWe were unable to draw conclusions about withdrawal symptoms after abrupt or gradual stopping of an antidepressant, as this generally was not assessed. \\nNone of the studies used very slow tapering schemes beyond a few weeks, tapered liquid forms of antidepressants, or used tapering strips (to allow tapering with very low doses). \\nNone of the identified studies investigated stopping combined with providing supportive therapy such as online support or self‐help therapy. \\nCertainty of evidence \\nOverall, the certainty of evidence was low to very low. This means we have limited or little confidence in the results, and new research is likely to change our conclusions. The main reasons for this assessment of evidence certainty were that trials did not distinguish between symptoms of relapse of depression and symptoms of withdrawal. Also, most studies used no tapering or very \"rapid\" tapering schedules (four weeks or less), and nearly all studies included people with recurrent depression (more than two episodes). \\nConclusions \\nWe found few studies that examined stopping long‐term antidepressants. We are uncertain if the approaches for stopping long‐term antidepressants studied to date are effective and safe in people with recurrent depression. People should discuss with their doctor when they want to stop their antidepressant. \\nFuture studies should include people in primary care with only one or no earlier episodes of depression, older people, and people taking antidepressants for anxiety. Studies should taper antidepressants slowly while taking care to distinguish withdrawal symptoms from relapse. \\n', '10.1002-14651858.CD005231.pub3-abstract.txt': \"Can smokers be helped to reduce the harm caused by cigarette smoking by smoking fewer cigarettes or using different tobacco products? \\nBackground \\nThe best thing to do to reduce the harms caused by smoking is to quit, but some people may not want to do this or may feel that they are unable to stop smoking completely. Cutting down the number of cigarettes smoked daily or using different tobacco products, such as chewing tobacco or low‐tar cigarettes, may reduce some of the harm caused by smoking. It may also help people to stop smoking completely in the long term. On the other hand, reducing smoking or using other tobacco products may not improve health and could reduce a person's motivation to quit smoking altogether. It is important that we review the evidence to find out whether these approaches could help smokers who do not want to or cannot quit to reduce the harm caused by their smoking. We were mainly interested in whether these approaches improved the health of smokers, but also looked at smoking reduction and quitting rates. \\nStudy characteristics \\nWe found 20 randomised controlled trials that tested ways to help people to cut down the number of cigarettes they smoked. Some of these just advised smokers to smoke less, but most also provided them with a product to help them cut down: nicotine replacement therapy (NRT), varenicline, bupropion, electronic cigarettes (ecigs), or snus (a form of smokeless, oral tobacco). We also found four randomized controlled trials that tested the effects of using cigarettes designed to reduce the damage caused by smoking: reduced tar, carbon or nicotine cigarettes. Most of the studies used NRT to help people to reduce their smoking. All of the studies included people who were not planning to quit smoking soon. The research is current to October 2015. \\nKey results \\nEight studies (with 3081 smokers) found that using NRT roughly doubled the likelihood of halving the number of cigarettes smoked each day, compared to using a placebo. Using NRT in this way also nearly doubled the likelihood of quitting completely. One trial each tested bupropion, varenicline, ecigs and snus to help reduce the harms caused by smoking, and there was no evidence that any of these treatments helped smokers to reduce the number of cigarettes they were smoking each day. This may be because there has not yet been enough research into these methods. Only one of the trials testing cigarettes designed to reduce risk measured their effect on the number of people quitting smoking. It found that people were not more likely to quit smoking if they used reduced‐nicotine cigarettes than if they smoked their usual cigarettes. We did not find any trials which reported the long‐term health effects of the treatments, and so it remains uncertain how much health benefit there is from reducing the number of cigarettes smoked each day or smoking cigarettes designed to be less harmful. \\nQuality of evidence \\nThe tobacco industry funded three of the included studies of cigarettes designed to reduce risk. None of the studies looked at whether there had been a long‐term change in the health of the users. We rate the quality of the evidence looking at how many people quit smoking as 'low' or 'very low', generally because the findings are based on a small number of studies. We need more studies to investigate methods of reducing the harm caused by continued smoking. These need to measure the health of the users over a long period. \\n\", '10.1002-14651858.CD013720.pub3-pls.txt': 'Antioxidants to prevent respiratory decline in people with Duchenne muscular dystrophy\\nReview question \\nWhat are the effects (benefits and harms) of antioxidants\\xa0for preventing breathing problems becoming worse in people with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD)? \\nBackground \\nDuchenne muscular dystrophy is an inherited condition where\\xa0boys show signs of muscle weakness in early childhood that become worse over time.

It is therefore important that effective treatments for SH patients are developed. There has been an increase in the use of interventions for SH in children and adolescents.

This update includes only studies on COVID‐19, published up to 13 November 2020. \\nWhat we found \\nWe found 62 studies. Most (49 studies) were modelling studies; only 13 used real‐life data (observational studies). Studies took place across the world and at different times during the pandemic. Levels of COVID‐19 within countries varied. \\nMost studies compared current travel‐related control measures with no travel‐related controls.

Additionally, some studies found no effect. Studies also predicted that these restrictions would delay the outbreak, but the delay ranged from one day to 85 days in different studies. \\nScreening at borders (13 modelling studies and 13 observational studies) \\nThese studies assessed screening at borders, including screening people with symptoms or who had potentially been exposed to COVID‐19, or testing people, before or after they travelled. \\nFor screening based on symptoms or potential\\xa0exposure to COVID‐19, modelling studies found that screening reduced imported or exported cases and delayed outbreaks.

Differences in effects may depend on how long people were quarantined for and how well they followed the rules. \\nQuarantine and screening at borders (7 modelling studies and 4 observational studies) \\nFor quarantine and screening at borders, most studies suggested some benefit, however the size of this effect differed between studies. For example, observational studies reported that between 68% and 92% of cases would be detected. Differences in effects may depend on how long people were quarantined for and how often they were tested while in quarantine. \\nHow reliable are these results? \\nOur confidence in these results is limited. Most studies were based on mathematical predictions (modelling), so we lack real‐life evidence. Further, we were not confident that models used correct assumptions, so our confidence in the evidence on travel restrictions and quarantine, in particular, is very low. Some studies were published quickly online as ‘preprints’. Preprints do not undergo the normal rigorous checks of published studies, so we are not certain how reliable they are. Also, the studies were very different from each other and their results varied according to the specification of each travel measure (e.g. the type of screening approach), how it was put into practice and enforced, the amount of cross‐border travel, levels of community transmission and other types of national measures to control the pandemic. \\nWhat this means \\nOverall, international travel‐related control measures may help to limit the spread of COVID‐19 across national borders. Restricting cross‐border travel can be a helpful measure. Screening travellers only for symptoms at borders is likely to miss many cases; testing may be more effective but may also miss cases if only performed upon arrival. Quarantine that lasts at least 10 days can prevent travellers spreading COVID‐19 and may be more effective if combined with another measure such as testing, especially if people follow the rules. \\nFuture research needs to be better reported. More studies should focus on real‐life evidence, and should assess potential benefits and risks of travel‐related control measures to individuals and society as a whole. \\n', '10.1002-14651858.CD015061-pls.txt': 'Which treatments are best for symptoms in COVID‐19 patients at the end of life?\\nThe burden of symptoms at the end of life of COVID‐19 patients and helpful treatments \\nCOVID‐19 patients may show symptoms such as breathlessness or delirium at the end of life. The goal of palliative medicine is to relieve such symptoms with specific treatments. Treatments can be drugs, for example opioids, or non‐drugs, such as breathing techniques or relaxation.\\xa0 \\nWhat was the aim of our review? \\nTo explore\\xa0how well different interventions (drugs and non‐drugs)\\xa0work for the treatment of palliative symptoms in COVID‐19 patients at the end of life.

We included studies looking at how well different palliative treatments work to relieve COVID‐19‐associated symptoms at the end of life. We wanted to compare studies investigating different medicines or therapies, but we only found studies without a comparison group. Only one study reported the specific drugs used for individual symptoms. \\nKey results \\nWe found four studies that were published in five papers. Individual papers included between 61 and 2105 participants, and two papers partially reported on the same participants. All of the included studies investigated different drug treatments for palliative symptom management in people with COVID‐19. \\nDrugs for symptom control at the end of life \\nAll of the included studies reported on the effectiveness of palliative care for symptom relief.\\xa0In all studies, clinicians or nursing staff rated symptom relief rather than the patients themselves. Since the quality of the evidence was very low, we do not know the true effect of drug treatments on symptom relief and have very low confidence in the results of the studies. We did not find any data on quality of life; symptom burden; satisfaction of patients, caregivers, and relatives; or safety of the drug treatments. \\nNon‐drug therapies for symptom control at the end of life \\nWe did not find any data on the benefits and harms of non‐drug therapies for symptom control of COVID‐19 patients at the end of life. \\nConclusions \\nBased on our findings, we could not draw any conclusions on palliative symptom control of people with COVID‐19.

Patients with AKI show increased levels of serum uraemic toxins (creatinine and urea), serum potassium and metabolic acids, accumulation of water and in the most cases a reduction in urine output. In this population these chemicals and fluid overload are related to increased rates of death. Theoretically, effective removal of toxins and excess water from the bloodstream might improve patient outcomes (such as mortality rate and recovery of kidney function). \\nContinuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) is a blood purification technique that enables removal of excess water and toxins. CRRT involves blood being diverted from the patient via a catheter (a hollow, flexible tube placed into a vein) through a filtering system which continuously and steadily removes excess water and toxins; purified blood is then returned to the patient via the catheter. Higher intensity CRRT improves the removal of toxins and excess water. The aim of this review was to investigate the effect of different intensities of CRRT (intensive or less intensive) on death, recovery of kidney function, and adverse events in people with AKI who are critically ill. \\nWhat did we do? \\nWe searched the literature up until February 2016 and identified six studies enrolling 3185 patients with AKI that were evaluated in this review. \\nWhat did we find? \\nSix randomised studies enrolling 3185 participants were included in our review. Compared to less intensive CRRT, intensive CRRT did not reduce the risk of death, improve the recovery of kidney function, or reduce the risk of adverse events (such as bleeding) in patients with AKI. Intensive CRRT was associated with an increased risk of low blood phosphate levels. \\n', '10.1002-14651858.CD013874.pub2-pls.txt': \"Rituximab for people with multiple sclerosis\\nKey messages \\n–\\xa0Rituximab may offer moderate‐to‐large benefit against a range of other medicines in preventing relapses in relapsing multiple sclerosis (MS).

If high‐speed instruments, such as a drill, are used, aerosols are generated, which consist of tiny particles that remain suspended in the air and that can be inhaled or that settle farther away on surfaces. These aerosols contain a variety of micro‐organisms and may transmit infections either through direct contact or indirectly through the contaminated surfaces. To prevent the spread of infection, it may help to reduce the number of micro‐organisms that are present in these aerosols. The use of mouth rinses before a dental procedure ('preprocedural mouth rinse') has been suggested as a possible way to reduce the amount of contamination of these aerosols. Chlorhexidine, povidone iodine and cetylpyridinium chloride (CPC) are some of the commonly used mouth rinses. They act by killing or inactivating the micro‐organisms in the mouth and thereby reducing the level of contamination in the aerosol that is generated. We wanted to find out whether rinsing the mouth before a dental procedure reduces the contamination of aerosols produced during dental procedures in practice and helps prevent the transmission of infectious diseases. \\nHow did we identify and evaluate the evidence? \\nWe searched for all relevant studies that compared mouth rinses used before dental procedures against placebo (fake treatment), no intervention or another mouth rinse considered to be inactive. We then compared the results, and summarised the evidence from all the studies. Finally, we assessed our confidence in the evidence. To do this, we considered factors such as the way studies were conducted, study sizes and consistency of findings across studies. \\nWhat did we find? \\nWe found 17 studies that met our inclusion criteria. These studies used chlorhexidine, CPC, essential oil/herbal mouth rinses, povidone iodine and boric acid in comparison to no rinsing, or rinsing with\\xa0water, saline (salt water) or another mouth rinse. None of the studies measured the how often dental healthcare providers became infected with micro‐organisms. All the included studies measured the level of bacterial contamination in droplets or aerosols in the dental clinic. They did not examine contamination with viruses or fungi.\\xa0 \\nMost rinses decreased bacterial contamination in aerosols to some extent, but there was considerable variation in the effects and we do not know what size of reduction is necessary to reduce infection risk.\\xa0 \\nThe studies did not provide any information on costs, change in micro‐organisms in the patient's mouth or side effects such as temporary discolouration, altered taste, allergic reaction or hypersensitivity. The studies did not assess whether patients were happy to use a mouth rinse or whether it was easy for dentists to implement.\\xa0 \\nOverall, the results suggest that using a preprocedural mouth rinse may reduce the level of bacterial contamination in aerosols compared with no rinsing or rinsing with water, but we have only low or very low certainty that the evidence is reliable and we do not know how this reduction in contamination relates to the risk of infection. \\nWhat does this mean? \\nWe have very little confidence in the evidence, and further studies may change the findings of our review.

Using a tailored, user‐testing approach to develop participant information leaflets makes little or no difference to recruitment. \\nOf the 72 strategies tested, only 7 involved more than one study. We need more studies to understand whether they work or not. \\nOur question \\nWe reviewed the evidence about the effect of things trial teams do to try and improve recruitment to their trials. We found 68 studies involving more than 74,000 people. \\nBackground \\nFinding participants for trials can be difficult, and trial teams try many things to improve recruitment. It is important to know whether these actually work. Our review looked for studies that examined this question using chance to allocate people to different recruitment strategies because this is the fairest way of seeing if one approach is better than another. \\nKey results \\nWe found 68 studies including 72 comparisons. We have high certainty in what we found for only three of these. \\n1. Telling people what they are receiving in the trial rather than not telling them improves recruitment. Our best estimate is that if 100 people were told what they were receiving in a randomised trial, and 100 people were not, 10 more would take part n the group who knew. There is some uncertainty though: it could be as few as 7 more per hundred, or as many as 13 more. \\n2. Phoning people who do not respond to a postal invitation to take part is also effective. Our best estimate is that if investigators called 100 people who did not respond to a postal invitation, and did not call 100 others, 6 more would take part in the trial among the group who received a call. However, this number could be as few as 3 more per hundred, or as many as 9 more. \\n3. Using a tailored, user‐testing approach to develop participant information leaflets did not make much difference. The researchers who tested this method spent a lot of time working with people like those to be recruited to decide what should be in the participant information leaflet and what it should look like. Our best estimate is that if 100 people got the new leaflet, 1 more would take part in the trial compared to 100 who got the old leaflet. However, there is some uncertainty, and it could be 1 fewer (i.e. worse than the old leaflet) per hundred, or as many as 3 more. \\nWe had moderate certainty in what we found for eight other comparisons; our confidence was reduced for most of these because the method had been tested in only one study. We had much less confidence in the other 61 comparisons because the studies had design flaws, were the only studies to look at a particular method, had a very uncertain result or were mock trials rather than real ones. \\nStudy characteristics \\nThe 68 included studies covered a very wide range of disease areas, including antenatal care, cancer, home safety, hypertension, podiatry, smoking cessation and surgery. Primary, secondary and community care were included. The size of the studies ranged from 15 to 14,467 participants. Studies came from 12 countries; there was also one multinational study involving 19 countries. The USA and UK dominated with 25 and 22 studies, respectively. The next largest contribution came from Australia with eight studies. \\nThe small print \\nOur search updated our 2010 review and is current to February 2015. We also identified six studies published after 2015 outside the search. The review includes 24 mock trials where the researchers asked people about whether they would take part in an imaginary trial.

An important adverse effect of anthracyclines is damage to the heart, which can lead to asymptomatic (without complaints) or symptomatic (with complaints) cardiac problems during and after cancer treatment. While there are several drugs available to treat other types of cardiac problems in adults, it is not known if these drugs are beneficial in treating cardiac problems caused by anthracyclines in childhood cancer patients and survivors.

We searched for and summarised studies that evaluated drugs for treating anthracycline‐induced cardiac problems in childhood cancer patients and survivors. \\nWe identified two randomised studies evaluating two different drugs in two different types of patients. One of these drugs, an angiotensin‐converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor (enalapril), had a short‐term beneficial effect on heart function in survivors of childhood cancer with asymptomatic cardiac problems caused by anthracyclines compared with placebo. However, the drug had no significant beneficial effect on other important outcomes and was associated with side effects such as dizziness and fatigue. This study was of reasonable/good quality.

The pancreas can be divided into the head of the pancreas (right part of the pancreas) and the body and tail of the pancreas (left part or distal part of the pancreas). Distal pancreatic cancer is cancer of the body and/or tail of the pancreas. Removal of distal pancreatic cancer by surgery (distal pancreatectomy) is the preferred treatment for people with distal pancreatic cancers limited to the pancreas who are likely to withstand major surgery, because no other treatments have the potential to cure pancreatic cancer. Cancer can be removed through an abdominal operation, either laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy or open distal pancreatectomy. Laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy is a relatively new procedure as compared with the well‐established open distal pancreatectomy. In operations on other parts of the body, laparoscopic surgery has been shown to reduce complications and length of hospital stay as compared with open surgery. However, concerns remain about the safety of laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy in terms of complications after operation (postoperative complications). In addition, it is not clear whether laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy achieves the same amount of cancer clearance as is attained by open distal pancreatectomy. It also is not clear whether laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy is better than open distal pancreatectomy in terms of earlier recovery after operation. We sought to resolve this issue by searching the medical literature for studies on this topic until June 2015. \\nStudy characteristics \\nNo randomised controlled trials have examined this topic. Randomised controlled trials are the best studies for finding out whether one treatment is better or worse than another because they ensure that similar types of people are receiving the treatments being assessed. In the absence of randomised controlled trials, we sought information from non‐randomised studies. We identified 12 non‐randomised studies that compared laparoscopic versus open distal pancreatectomy in a total of 1576 patients. One of these studies did not provide results in a useable way. Thus, we included 11 studies in which a total of 1506 patients underwent distal pancreatectomy. Some 353 patients underwent laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy, and 1153 patients underwent open distal pancreatectomy. In all studies, historical information was collected from hospital records (retrospective studies). In general, historical information is less reliable than newly collected (prospective) information and findings of randomised controlled trials. \\nKey results \\nDifferences in short‐term deaths, long‐term deaths, percentage of people with major complications, percentage of people with a pancreatic fistula (abnormal communication between the pancreas and other organs or the skin), recurrence of cancer at final time of follow‐up of participants, percentage of people with any complications and percentage of patients in whom cancer was not completely removed were imprecise. Average length of hospital stay was shorter in the laparoscopic group than in the open group by about two days. However, this is not relevant until we can be sure that cancer cures are similar between laparoscopic surgery and open surgery. No studies have reported quality of life at any point in time, short‐term recurrence of cancer, time to return to normal activity, time to return to work or blood transfusion requirements. \\nQuality of the evidence \\nThe quality of the evidence was very low, mainly because it was not clear whether similar types of participants received laparoscopic and open distal pancreatectomy. In many studies, people with less extensive cancer received laparoscopic surgery, and those with more extensive cancer received open surgery. This makes study findings unreliable. Well‐designed randomised controlled trials are necessary if we are to obtain good quality evidence on this topic. \\n', '10.1002-14651858.CD009058.pub3-abstract.txt': \"Cryotherapy for liver metastases\\nReview question \\nIs cryotherapy (cooling) beneficial or harmful for local destruction of cancer (tumours) spread to the liver? \\nBackground \\nWhen cancer spreads in the body (metastasis), one of the most common sites is the liver. Besides cancers of the liver (primary liver cancer), liver metastases from colorectal cancer are the most common cancer affecting the liver. More than half of people who have cancer spread to the liver die from complications. Cryotherapy is one of methods, used to destroy metastases in the liver. This method requires placing a special probe near the cancer site. The probe is used to deliver extreme cold to the site, which is produced by liquid nitrogen or argon gas. Placement of the probe can be guided using ultrasound or computed tomography (a special x‐ray). The rapid freezing process kills the cancer cells, and the size of the cancer is reduced. However, it is not clear if this treatment prolongs life or increases quality of life of affected people. \\nWe reviewed the evidence about the effect of cryotherapy in destroying cancer metastases in the liver. We searched for studies assessing the effect of cryotherapy in comparison with no treatment or any other treatment in people with liver metastases from cancer of any location. We aimed to assess the effect of cryotherapy on the risk of death, quality of life, and adverse events (side effects caused by the treatment). \\nStudy characteristics \\nWe last searched for evidence in June 2018. We included only one trial conducted in Ukraine, and participants' primary cancer was colorectal (bowel) cancer in 66% of instances, but there were also people with stomach, breast, skin, and other tumours. All of them had cancer spread to the liver. In this trial, 123 participants were allocated at random to receive either cryotherapy (63 people) or conventional surgery (affected parts of the liver were removed; 60 people). \\nFunding \\nThe trial did not provide information on funding.\\nKey results \\nThe trial was at high risk of bias. The participants were followed for up to 10 years (minimum five months). The trial reported that the mortality at 10 years was 81% (51/63) in the cryotherapy group and 92% (55/60) in the conventional surgery group. We judged the evidence as low‐certainty evidence. We found no evidence of a difference in proportion of participants with recurrence of the malignancy in the liver: 86% (54/63) of the participants in the cryotherapy group and 95% (57/60) of the participants in the conventional surgery group developed a new malignancy (low‐certainty evidence). The frequency of reported complications was similar between the cryotherapy group and the conventional surgery group, except for postoperative pain. Both insignificant and pronounced pain were reported to be more common in the cryotherapy group while intense pain was reported to be more common in the conventional surgery group. However, it was not reported whether there was any evidence of a difference. The frequency of unwanted effects (adverse events or complications) was mostly similar in both groups, but pain intensity and frequency seemed to differ between the groups. There were no intervention‐related mortality or bile leakages. The trial did not provide data on quality of life; cancer mortality, and time to progression of liver metastases. \\nReliability of the evidence \\nThe evidence for the effectiveness of cryotherapy versus conventional surgery in people with liver metastases is of low certainty. We are uncertain about our estimate and cannot determine whether cryotherapy compared with conventional surgery is beneficial or harmful. We found no evidence for the benefits or harms of cryotherapy compared with no intervention, or versus systemic treatments. \\n\", '10.1002-14651858.CD013189-pls.txt': \"What is the diagnostic accuracy of optical coherence tomography (OCT), an imaging test, for the detection of skin cancer in adults? \\nWhy is improving the diagnosis of skin cancer important? \\nThere are several different types of skin cancer.

Cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC) and basal cell carcinoma (BCC) are usually localised (i.e. limited to a certain part of the body) skin cancers, although cSCC can spread to other parts of the body and BCC can cause disfigurement if not recognised early. Diagnosing a skin cancer when it is not actually present (a false‐positive result) may result in unnecessary surgery and other investigations and can cause stress and anxiety to the patient. Making the correct diagnosis is important, and mistaking one skin cancer for another can lead to the wrong treatment being used or lead to a delay in effective treatment. \\nWhat is the aim of the review? \\nThe aim of this Cochrane Review was to find out how accurate optical coherence tomography (OCT) is for diagnosing skin cancer. Researchers in Cochrane included five studies to answer this question. Two studies were concerned with the diagnosis of melanoma and three with the diagnosis of BCC. \\nWhat was studied in the review? \\nA number of tools are available to skin cancer specialists which allow a more detailed examination of the skin compared to examination by the naked eye alone. Currently, a dermoscope is used by most skin cancer specialists, which magnifies the skin lesion (a mole or area of skin with an unusual appearance in comparison with the surrounding skin) using a bright light source. OCT magnifies the surface of a skin lesion to the level of that seen using a microscope using near‐infrared light. It is quick to perform but is more expensive compared to dermoscopy and requires specialist training. Review authors examined how useful OCT is to help diagnose skin cancers when used after visual inspection or visual inspection plus dermoscopy. \\nWhat are the main results of the review? \\nThe review included five studies: two studies with 97 participants with 133 skin lesions suspected of being melanoma, and three studies with 305 participants with 396 lesions suspected of being BCC of which one (50 lesions) also analysed cSCCs (nine lesions). \\nThe studies investigating the accuracy of OCT for diagnosing melanoma were small and too different from each other to allow a reliable estimate of the accuracy of OCT for melanoma to be made. Similarly, only one small, low‐quality study investigated the accuracy of OCT for diagnosing cSCC. \\nFor identifying BCC, two studies showed the effects of skin specialists using OCT after visual inspection alone, or visual inspection with dermoscopic examination. These two studies indicated that in theory, if OCT were to be used in a group of 1000 people with skin lesions that were particularly difficult to diagnose, of whom 600 (60%) actually had BCC, then: \\n‐ an estimated 662 people would have an OCT result confirming that a BCC was present and of these 93 (14%) would not actually have had a BCC (false‐positive result); \\n‐ of the 338 people with an OCT result indicating that no BCC was present, 31 (9%) would actually have a BCC (false‐negative result). \\nCompared to making a diagnosis of BCC using visual inspection plus dermoscopy, the addition of OCT in this group would reduce the number of false‐positive results by 87 (thus reducing unnecessary surgical procedures) and would miss 53 fewer BCCs. \\nHow reliable are the results of the studies of this review? \\nIn all included studies, the diagnosis of skin cancer was made by lesion biopsy (OCT/dermoscopy positive) (a biopsy involves taking a sample of body cells and examining them under a microscope), and the absence of skin cancer was confirmed by biopsy (OCT/dermoscopy negative)*. This is likely to have been a reliable method for deciding whether people really had skin cancer. However, the small number of studies included in this review, and variability between them, reduced the reliability of findings. Included studies also had important limitations, in particular study participants were from more restricted groups than would be eligible for an OCT scan in practice (e.g. all studies included people with skin lesions that had already been selected for surgical removal), while the way in which OCT was used may not reflect real‐life situations. \\nWho do the results of this review apply to? \\nStudies were conducted in Europe and the US only. Average age (reported in only two studies) was 46 years for melanoma and 63 years for BCC. The percentage of people with a final diagnosis of melanoma was 23% and 27% (in two studies), ranged from 58% to 61% for BCC (three studies), and was 18% for cSCC (one study). For the diagnosis of BCC, the results apply to people with 'pink' and non‐pigmented skin lesions that the clinician considers particularly difficult to diagnose by the naked eye alone. \\nWhat are the implications of this review? \\nNot enough research has been done on using OCT in detecting skin cancers. The results of this review suggest that OCT might help to diagnose BCC when it is difficult to distinguish it from benign skin lesions, but it is not yet clear whether it can adequately distinguish between BCC, cSCC, and melanoma skin cancers. More studies are needed comparing OCT to dermoscopy and to other microscopic techniques (such as reflectance confocal microscopy) in well‐described groups of people with suspicious skin lesions. \\nHow up‐to‐date is this review? \\nThe review authors searched for and used studies published up to August 2016.\\n*In these studies biopsy or clinical follow‐up were the standard comparisons.\\n\", '10.1002-14651858.CD013304.pub2-pls.txt': \"Do antipsychotic medicines reduce \\xa0agitated behaviour and psychotic symptoms in people with Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia? \\n\\xa0\\nKey messages \\nIt is uncertain whether older, first‐generation or ‘typical’ antipsychotic medicines such as haloperidol have an effect on agitated behaviour (for example, restlessness and aggression); the effect is moderate at best. Typical antipsychotic medicines may decrease delusions and hallucinations slightly in people with dementia.\\xa0 \\nNewer, second‐generation ‘atypical’ antipsychotic medicines, such as risperidone, probably reduce agitated behaviour slightly. Atypical antipsychotic medicines probably have no effect on psychotic symptoms.\\xa0 \\nBoth first‐ and second‐generation antipsychotic medicines increase the risk of drowsiness and other unwanted events. When patients’ symptoms improve after antipsychotics have been prescribed, this is probably largely due to natural improvement in symptoms over time. \\nWhat are antipsychotic medicines? \\nAntipsychotics are medicines prescribed to treat psychotic symptoms and severely disturbed behaviour in some mental illnesses, such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and severe depression. Psychotic symptoms are delusions (very strongly held beliefs in something which is not true) and hallucinations (sensing – usually seeing or hearing ‐ things which are not really there). \\nAntipsychotic medicines are often divided into two groups:\\n1. first‐generation (older) or ‘typical’ antipsychotics, for example haloperidol;\\n2. second‐generation (newer) or ‘atypical’ antipsychotics, for example risperidone.\\nBoth types can cause unwanted effects, such as drowsiness, movement disorders (for example, involuntary or uncontrollable movements, tremors, muscle contractions) and weight gain. \\nWhy do people with dementia need antipsychotics? \\nPeople with dementia quite often experience hallucinations and delusions during their illness for some time. Particularly in the later stages of the illness, they may also show agitated behaviours such as restlessness, shouting out or aggression towards others. It is important to try to understand what is driving these behaviours and there are many ways to manage them which do not involve drugs. However, antipsychotic medicines have often been prescribed to people with dementia for these problems. In many countries, they are prescribed less often than in the past but are still used when the symptoms are severe. \\nWhat did we want to find out? \\nWe wanted to know how well antipsychotic medicines reduce the severity of agitation and psychotic symptoms in people with the two commonest types of dementia, namely dementia due to Alzheimer’s disease and vascular dementia. We also wanted to know how many people experienced unwanted effects. \\nWhat did we do? \\nWe searched for studies that investigated antipsychotic medicines currently available in the USA or European Union by comparing them with placebo (a ’dummy’ pill), for treatment of persistent agitation or psychotic symptoms. People in the studies had to have Alzheimer’s disease or vascular dementia. They could be any age and reside in a care home, a hospital, or the community. Most of the people in the studies had to be experiencing agitation (including aggression) or psychotic symptoms, or both, at the start of the study. \\nWe compared and summarised the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes. \\nWhat did we find? \\nWe found 24 studies with a total of 6090 people:\\n‐ six studies tested typical antipsychotics, mostly haloperidol;\\xa0\\n‐ 20 studies tested atypical antipsychotics, such as risperidone, olanzapine, and aripiprazole; and\\xa0 \\n‐ two studies tested both typical and atypical antipsychotics.\\nAll the studies compared antipsychotics with placebo. The people were living in institutions, hospitals, the community, or a combination of these settings. \\nMain results \\nTypical antipsychotics (haloperidol, thiothixene) compared with placebo:\\n‐ may improve symptoms of psychosis slightly (2 studies, 240 people), but we are uncertain about their effect on agitation (4 studies, 361 people);\\xa0 \\n‐ probably increase the risk of drowsiness (3 studies, 466 people), and movement disorders (3 studies, 467 people);\\xa0 \\n‐ may slightly increase the risk of serious unwanted effects (1 study, 193 people) and of death (6 studies, 578 people).\\xa0 \\nThere was no evidence about the risk of non‐serious and serious unwanted effects combined.\\nAtypical antipsychotics (risperidone, olanzapine, aripiprazole, quetiapine) compared with placebo: \\n‐ probably slightly reduce agitation (7 studies, 1971 people) and may slightly reduce aggression (1 study, 301 people), but probably make no important difference to symptoms of psychosis (12 studies, 3364 people); \\n‐ increase the risk of drowsiness (13 studies, 2878 people) and probably slightly increase movement disorders (15 studies, 4180 people); \\n‐ probably slightly increase the risk of experiencing any non‐serious or serious unwanted effect combined, the risk of serious unwanted effects, and the risk of death (17 studies, 5032 people). \\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence? \\nOverall, our confidence in the evidence about typical antipsychotics is limited and our confidence in the evidence about atypical antipsychotics moderate. Typical antipsychotics have been investigated in just a few studies. In addition, the studies about typical and atypical antipsychotics did not always use the best methods to carry out their investigations, or did not report the results. Consequently, the effects on agitation or psychosis may have been overestimated, and the effects on adverse events underestimated. \\nHow up to date is this evidence? \\nThe evidence is up‐to‐date to 7 January 2021.\\n\", '10.1002-14651858.CD014877.pub2-abstract.txt': 'Rapid molecular tests for tuberculosis and tuberculosis drug resistance: the views and experiences of people who are tested and healthcare providers \\nWhat is the aim of this review? \\nWe aimed to understand the experiences and opinions of people using rapid automated tests that identify tuberculosis and resistance to tuberculosis drugs (molecular diagnostic tests). Users include people who might have tuberculosis and their families or caregivers, doctors, nurses, laboratory staff, and managers of services or programmes. \\nWhat was studied in this review?\\xa0 \\nRapid molecular diagnostic tests were designed to make diagnosis easier and faster for people with signs and symptoms of tuberculosis, because they do not require a well‐equipped laboratory, but can be done in clinics closer to where people live. Since these tests can also suggest whether an individual suffers from drug‐resistant tuberculosis (including multidrug‐resistant tuberculosis (MDR‐TB)), the right treatment can be started earlier. We collected and analysed all relevant studies and found 32 studies conducted in areas where tuberculosis is common in low‐ and middle‐income countries. \\nMDR‐TB is tuberculosis caused by resistance to at least rifampicin and isoniazid, the two most effective first‐line drugs used to treat tuberculosis.\\xa0 \\nThis qualitative evidence synthesis links to another Cochrane Review that examines the diagnostic accuracy of a rapid molecular test for tuberculosis drug resistance. Yet, diagnostic tests only have an impact on health if they are put to use in a correct and timely manner.\\xa0Accuracy studies do not reveal what users think of or how they experience the test in question. We need to understand the perspectives and experiences of all users. Otherwise, we risk these tests not fitting settings where they are to be used or not being accessible for those in need. \\nWhat are the main findings? \\nPeople with tuberculosis value knowing what is wrong with them. People valued having an accurate diagnosis, avoiding delays in being diagnosed, having accessible testing facilities, and keeping cost low. Similarly, healthcare providers value having accurate tests that give them confidence in the diagnosis, rapid results, and keeping cost low, being able to use different specimens (such as sputum and stool) \\xa0and receiving information about drug resistance as part of the test results. Laboratory personnel appreciated that laboratory work was made easier and that staff was more satisfied thanks to rapid molecular diagnostic tests. \\nOur review also identified several challenges to realizing these values. Some people with tuberculosis and some healthcare providers were reluctant to use rapid molecular diagnostic tests because of fears of testing positive, concerns of stigma or discredit in the community, or expenses related to the testing. Additional support is required to overcome these barriers that are common to other approaches to testing for tuberculosis. Other challenges that led to delays and underuse of rapid molecular diagnostic tests were health system inefficiencies; poor quality of specimens; difficulty in transporting specimens; lack of sufficient resources such as staff or equipment; increased workload for providers; inefficiencies in integrating the test into routines at clinics; the complicated or lengthy steps involved in obtaining a tuberculosis diagnosis; clinicians relying too much on the test result while neglecting their own experience with diagnosing tuberculosis; and processes of implementing the test in national programmes that lacked data about real‐life situations and did not include all relevant stakeholders such as local decision‐makers, providers or people seeking a diagnosis. \\nLastly, people expressed concerns about unsustainable funding, maintenance requirements of the tests, lengthy delays in diagnosis, underuse of rapid molecular diagnostic tests, lack of tuberculosis diagnostic facilities in local communities, conflicts of interest between donors and people who utilize the tests, and too many restrictions on who was allowed to access the test. These concerns hampered access to prompt and accurate testing and treatment. This was particularly the case for vulnerable people, such as children, people with MDR‐TB, or those with limited ability to pay. \\nOverall, these challenges risk undoing the added value of rapid molecular diagnostic tests. They risk leading to less frequent use of these tests. Implementation of new diagnostic tests, like those considered in this review, will need to tackle the challenges identified in this review including weak infrastructure and systems, as well as insufficient data about real‐life situations before and during implementation in order to ensure the tests are accessible for those in need. \\nHow up to date is this review? \\nWe included studies published between 1 January 2007 and 20 October 2021. We limited all searches to 2007 onward because the development of Xpert MTB/RIF, the first rapid molecular diagnostic test in this review, was completed in 2009. \\n', '10.1002-14651858.CD010621.pub2-abstract.txt': \"Corneal collagen cross‐linking for thinning of the transparent front part of the eye ('keratoconus') \\nReview question  Is corneal collagen cross‐linking (CXL) a good treatment for slowing down the progression of keratoconus? \\nBackground  Keratoconus is a condition where the transparent front of the eye (cornea) gets thinner and begins to bulge. This leads to vision problems, usually short‐sightedness (distant objects appear blurred). The condition is more common in children and young adults and can deteriorate over time. Initially glasses and contact lenses can help. If the disease progresses, the only option may be a corneal transplant. \\nCXL is a new treatment for keratoconus. The eye doctor removes the outer layer of the cornea, puts in vitamin B2 eye drops, and then treats the eye with ultraviolet A light radiation. This can be done in outpatients and takes about an hour. \\nStudy characteristics  The searches are current to August 2014. We found three randomised controlled trials, which were done in the United States, the United Kingdom, and Australia. A total of 219 eyes were randomly allocated to treatment with CXL or no treatment. In all three studies the surgery was done in the same way. None of the studies included children. \\nKey results  Eyes treated with CXL were less likely to have problems with progression of bulging compared to eyes that were not treated. However, the studies were small and there were some concerns about the way they were done. It is therefore difficult to say exactly how much the treatment helped. None of the studies reported the risk of eyesight getting worse but, on average, treated eyes had better vision (about 10 letters better) compared to untreated eyes. None of the studies reported on a change in quality of life for the participant. The main adverse effects were inflammation and swelling; this occurred in approximately one in 10 participants. \\nQuality of the evidence  We judged the quality of the evidence to be very low because of problems in the way the studies were done and reported and the small number of eyes included. \\n\", '10.1002-14651858.CD014963-pls.txt': 'Are corticosteroids (anti‐inflammatory medicines) given orally or by injection an effective treatment for people with COVID‐19? \\nKey messages \\n• Corticosteroids (anti‐inflammatory medicines) given orally or by injection (systemic) are probably effective treatments for people hospitalised with COVID‐19.

They also reduce the activity of the immune system, which defends the body against disease and infection. Corticosteroids are used to treat a variety of conditions, such as asthma, eczema, joint strains and rheumatoid arthritis.\\xa0 \\nSystemic corticosteroids can be swallowed or given by injection to treat the whole body. High doses of corticosteroids taken over a long time may cause unwanted effects, such as increased appetite, difficulty sleeping and mood changes.\\xa0 \\nWhy are corticosteroids possible treatments for COVID‐19?\\xa0 \\nCOVID‐19 affects the lungs and airways. As the immune system fights the virus, the lungs and airways become inflamed, causing breathing difficulties. Corticosteroids reduce inflammation, so may reduce the need for breathing support with a ventilator (a machine that breathes for a patient). Some patients’ immune systems overreact to the virus causing further inflammation and tissue damage; corticosteroids may help to control this response. \\nWhat did we want to find out? \\nWe wanted to know whether systemic corticosteroids are an effective treatment for people with COVID‐19 and whether they cause unwanted effects. \\nWe were interested in:\\n• deaths from any cause up to 14 days after treatment, or longer if reported;• whether people got better or worse after treatment, based on their need for breathing support;• quality of life;• unwanted effects and infections caught in hospital. \\nWhat did we do?\\xa0We searched for studies that investigated\\xa0systemic corticosteroids for\\xa0people with mild, moderate or severe COVID‐19.

However, our confidence in the other evidence is low to very low, because studies did not use the most robust methods, and the way results were recorded and reported differed across studies.

The retina is the layer at the back of the eye that detects light, and the macula is essential for detailed vision. It has been suggested that surgery can prevent vision loss (or improve vision) in people with lamellar macular holes, but there is no current consensus. We reviewed published research to determine whether surgery improves vision for people with a lamellar macular hole. \\nHow did we identify and evaluate the evidence?First, we searched for randomised controlled studies (clinical studies where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups), because these studies provide the most robust evidence about the effects of treatment.

If these forms of access become dysfunctional the delivery of dialysis therapy becomes suboptimal. The most common cause of access dysfunction is the development of a restriction or conduit narrowing called 'stenosis'. Because early correction of stenosis is considered critical to maintain the patency (openness) of the access and prolong its use, guidelines recommend regular surveillance of the access (i.e. screening based on diagnostic tests) in addition to or instead of a physical exam (clinical monitoring) to identify and treat early lesions. \\nIn this review we included 14 studies, randomising 1390 participants to either a pre‐emptive correction of an access stenosis (i.e. before the access became dysfunctional) or a deferred correction of an access stenosis (i.e. if and when the access became dysfunctional). This review shows that pre‐emptive correction of an arteriovenous access stenosis does not improve longevity of the access overall. In people using grafts pre‐emptive correction does not reduce the risk of thrombosis or access loss. In people using fistulas pre‐emptive stenosis correction reduces the risk of thrombosis and may prolong the longevity of the access. However, this surveillance and pre‐emptive correction strategy may increase the number of access‐related procedures and procedure‐related adverse events. \\nThis systematic review presents, to clinicians and patients, evidence‐based data that do not support the use of access surveillance and pre‐emptive correction of stenosis in grafts. Although surveillance and pre‐emptive correction of stenosis reduce the risk of thrombosis and may reduce the risk of access loss in fistulas, they may also increase the risk of procedure‐related adverse events and health‐care cost. Large multicentre clinical trials are necessary in this patient population to better clarify potential harms and expected benefits of routine surveillance and pre‐emptive correction of fistula stenosis. \\n\", '10.1002-14651858.CD013738-pls.txt': 'Means restriction to prevent suicide on roads\\nWhy is this review important? \\nRoad traffic suicides are difficult to distinguish from motor vehicle crash fatalities and, therefore, no official figures exist for this method of suicide.

Acupuncture is a therapy in which thin needles are inserted into the skin at particular points. It originated in China, and is now used in many countries to treat people with migraine. We evaluated whether acupuncture reduces the number of episodes of migraine. We looked at the number of people in whom the number of migraine days per month was reduced by half or more than half. \\nKey results \\nFor this update, we reviewed 22 trials with 4985 people, published up to January 2016. We omitted five trials from the original review because they included people who had had migraine for less than 12 months. We included five new trials in this update. \\nIn four trials, acupuncture added to usual care or treatment of migraine on onset only (usually with pain‐killers) resulted in 41 in 100 people having the frequency of headaches at least halved, compared to 17 of 100 people given usual care only. \\nIn 15 trials, acupuncture was compared with 'fake' acupuncture, where needles are inserted at incorrect points or do not penetrate the skin. The frequency of headaches halved in 50 of 100 people receiving true acupuncture, compared with 41 of 100 people receiving 'fake' acupuncture. The results were dominated by three good quality large trials (with about 1200 people) showing that the effect of true acupuncture was still present after six months. There were no differences in the number of side effects of real and 'fake' acupuncture, or the numbers dropping out because of side effects. \\nIn five trials, acupuncture was compared to a drug proven to reduce the frequency of migraine attacks, but only three trials provided useful information. At three months, headache frequency halved in 57 of 100 people receiving acupuncture, compared with 46 of 100 people taking the drug. After six months, headache frequency halved in 59 of 100 people receiving acupuncture, compared with 54 of 100 people taking the drug. People receiving acupuncture reported side effects less often than people receiving drugs, and were less likely to drop out of the trial. \\nOur findings about the number of days with migraine per month can be summarized as follows. If people have six days with migraine per month on average before starting treatment, this would be reduced to five days in people receiving only usual care, to four days in those receiving fake acupuncture or a prophylactic drug, and to three and a half days in those receiving true acupuncture. \\nQuality of the evidence \\nOverall the quality of the evidence was moderate.\\n\", '10.1002-14651858.CD013316.pub2-pls.txt': \"Which method of determining MGMT promoter methylation best predicts survival in people with glioblastoma treated with temozolomide? \\nWhat was the aim of this review? \\nGlioblastoma is a very aggressive type of brain cancer. People with glioblastoma are usually treated with surgical removal of the tumour followed by radiotherapy, chemotherapy, or both. The standard chemotherapy is a medicine called temozolomide. Some glioblastoma tumours have a particular modification in their DNA (which contains the genetic code of organisms), and knowing whether a person has this modification is useful to predict how long the person may live after their diagnosis with cancer and how they may respond to temozolomide. The modification is known as 'methylation of the MGMT promoter region' and it can also affect MGMT protein expression (the way MGMT is made and modified). There are many ways to work out whether a tumour has this modification. In this review, we attempted to work out which method is best. \\nWhat we found \\nWe identified 32 studies comparing different ways to measure whether the MGMT promoter region is methylated. The main three methods were called 'methylation‐specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR),' 'pyrosequencing' (both of which look directly at the MGMT promoter region) and 'immunohistochemistry' (which looks at MGMT protein expression). We found that methylation‐specific PCR and pyrosequencing are better at predicting overall survival than immunohistochemistry. Methylation‐specific PCR and pyrosequencing can be carried out by targeting different parts of the tumour DNA. Pyrosequencing can be performed using different cut‐off thresholds to determine whether a tumour is methylated or unmethylated. We did not identify very clear signals in terms of the best parts of the DNA to target or which are the best cut‐off thresholds. \\nHow reliable are results of the studies in this review? \\nWe rated our confidence in the evidence as 'moderate' for our conclusions about methylation‐specific PCR, but as 'low' for pyrosequencing. Although there were many studies, they all looked at different variants of the methods, so it is difficult to work out exactly which variant is best. \\nWhat are the implications of this review? \\nOur review indicates both methylation‐specific PCR and pyrosequencing provide better predictions of survival than immunohistochemistry. There is some evidence that pyrosequencing may be better than methylation‐specific PCR at predicting overall survival, depending on the DNA targets and cut‐off thresholds used. We documented the most frequent DNA targets used in methylation‐specific PCR and pyrosequencing. We described cut‐off thresholds used in pyrosequencing, although it is unclear which of these is best. \\n\", '10.1002-14651858.CD013432.pub2-pls.txt': \"Mepolizumab or benralizumab for people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) \\nBackground to the question \\nChronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a lung condition in which people can experience severe difficulties with breathing and an associated reduction in their quality of life. \\nFor people with COPD, episodes in which the condition of patients seriously worsens are a major concern. We examined the findings of clinical trials to see whether mepolizumab or benralizumab, two new drugs, are better than placebo (dummy treatment) for people with COPD, and whether they reduce the number of episodes when the condition of patients seriously worsens. \\nStudy characteristics \\nSix clinical studies compared either mepolizumab or benralizumab to placebo in a total of 5542 people with COPD. We examined the findings of the studies in terms of episodes when patients' conditions flared up requiring additional treatment, patient quality of life, patient performance in breathing tests, and side effects of the medication. \\nMain results \\nThree studies used mepolizumab, and the other three studies used benralizumab.\\nMepolizumab 100 mg reduced the rate of flare‐ups in a group of people with both COPD and higher levels of blood eosinophils (a type of white blood cells involved in inflammatory and allergic reactions). When mepolizumab is given in a higher dose (300 mg or 750 mg) the rate of flare‐ups is probably reduced. \\nBenralizumab at a dose of 100mg resulted in a clear reduction in the number of episodes requiring admission to hospital, and when given at a lower dose (10mg) probably reduces flare‐ups requiring hospitalisation. This is in people with COPD and higher levels of blood eosinophils. \\nFurther studies comparing mepolizumab or benralizumab to a placebo may provide more clarity on the role of these drugs for COPD. \\nQuality of the evidence \\nThe included studies were for the most part very well‐designed and robust, and the evidence was generally of high quality. \\n\", '10.1002-14651858.CD013839.pub2-pls.txt': \"Does surgical removal of the lower leg (amputation) through the knee offer patients improved surgical recovery and better rehabilitation than amputation above the knee? \\nBackground \\nEach year, thousands of people worldwide need to have their lower leg surgically removed (lower limb amputation) due to problems such as blockages in blood vessels (vascular disease), diabetes, and injury. When an amputation is planned, a surgeon needs to decide how high up the leg to go, and therefore how much leg to leave behind. This decision is based on a balance between leaving as much of the leg as possible to improve a person’s ability to walk with an artificial leg (prosthesis) and removing anything that will not survive or go on to heal. If possible, a surgeon will prefer to preserve the knee, as having a working knee of one's own ensures a person’s best chance of walking. In some cases, this is not possible, and currently almost all people in this situation will have an amputation in the middle of the thigh (above the knee). However, another option is an amputation that can be performed through the knee joint itself. This carries potential advantages, as all of the muscles controlling movements of the thighbone are undamaged. A longer remaining leg would be expected to act as a lever to reduce the effort of swinging a prosthetic limb during walking and to aid sitting balance and transfer from bed to chair. By avoiding cutting the muscles, it is possible to minimise the physical trauma of surgery, allowing a procedure with reduced blood loss and less procedure time. In addition, the end of the thighbone and in some cases the knee cap remain. These bones can support the body’s weight at the end of the remaining limb through the same mechanism as kneeling down. On the other hand, some surgeons think that problems with healing may be more common with this approach. It is unclear whether amputation through the knee may therefore be a better operation, allowing improved recovery, greater likelihood of being able to walk with an artificial leg, and better quality of life, or whether it is associated with worse outcomes due to wound healing failure and the need for further surgery. The aim of this review was to look at the best available evidence to see how these operations compare.\\xa0 \\nThis review searched for studies that looked at whether through‐the‐knee or above‐the‐knee amputation resulted in better wound healing after amputation, improved patient survival, and reduced pain (clinical outcomes), as well as better rates of prosthesis use, walking speed, and quality of life (rehabilitation outcomes). \\nStudy characteristics and key results \\nA thorough search of the available literature was performed (up to 17 February 2021) to find studies comparing through‐knee with above‐knee amputation. We identified no studies comparing these two procedures. \\nCertainty of the evidence \\nWe were unable to assess the certainty of evidence because of the absence of studies included in this review. \\nConclusion \\nDue to a lack of randomised trials, we are unable to determine if through‐knee amputations have different outcomes from above‐knee amputations.

Insulin is a hormone that is released by the pancreas (a small organ behind the stomach) which controls the blood levels of glucose. In people with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) the pancreas does not produce any insulin, so the person has to inject insulin to control the glucose levels and keep well. The goal of insulin therapy is to provide insulin that mimics physiologic insulin secretion. Insulin is given by an injection under the skin (subcutaneous) by means of insulin syringes, insulin pens or insulin pumps. In order to control blood glucose levels in periods of fasting, basal or background insulin is needed. Basal insulin can be given by means of daily or twice‐daily injections of an intermediate‐acting or (ultra‐)long‐acting insulin. Basal insulin can be given as intermediate‐acting human neutral protamine Hagedorn (NPH) insulin or as (ultra‐)long‐acting analogue insulin (synthetic insulin). Bolus insulin is taken at mealtime (prandial insulin) to control blood glucose levels following a meal and is given by means of short‐acting or rapid‐acting insulin. The aim for most people with T1DM is to achieve near‐normal blood glucose levels to avoid long‐term complications such as kidney and eye disease and to allow flexibility regarding time, type and amount of food intake. The major unwanted effect of insulin therapy is hypoglycaemia (low blood glucose) which can be severe. \\nWe wanted to find out whether one type of (ultra‐)long‐acting insulin compared with NPH insulin or another type of (ultra‐)long‐acting insulin is better for people with T1DM. The outcomes we were specifically interested in were death, health‐related quality of life, severe (night‐time) hypoglycaemia, serious unwanted events, non‐fatal complications of diabetes (heart attacks, strokes) and levels of glycosylated haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) which is an indicator of long‐term glucose control. \\nWhat did we look for? \\nWe searched medical databases and contacted pharmaceutical manufacturers and drug regulatory agencies for studies that:— were randomised controlled trials (medical studies where participants are put randomly into one of the treatment groups);— included people with T1DM;— compared one (ultra‐)long‐acting insulin with another (ultra‐)long‐acting insulin or NPH insulin;— lasted at least 24 weeks. \\nWhat did we find?We found 26 studies including a total of 8780 participants (21% were children). The studies lasted between 24 weeks and two years. They compared:— NPH insulin with insulin detemir (nine studies);— NPH insulin with insulin glargine (nine studies);— Insulin detemir with insulin glargine (two studies);— Insulin degludec with insulin detemir (two studies);— Insulin degludec with insulin glargine (four studies). \\nNo study compared NPH insulin with insulin degludec.\\nKey results \\nThere were no clear differences for all main outcomes comparing (ultra‐)long‐acting insulin analogues with each other. \\nSevere hypoglycaemic episodes were reduced with insulin detemir: among 1000 participants using NPH insulin, 115 would experience severe hypoglycaemia; using insulin detemir there would be 36 participants fewer (9 to 55 participants fewer) experiencing severe hypoglycaemia. However, the results were inconsistent, meaning if another study was performed there may not be a clear difference between insulin detemir and NPH insulin. There was no clear difference regarding the risk of severe night‐time hypoglycaemia. There were no clear differences for health‐related quality of life, serious unwanted effects or HbA1c levels. Very few people experienced a heart attack or died, and stroke was not reported. \\nThere were no clear differences comparing insulin glargine with NPH insulin for all main outcomes. Very few people experienced a heart attack, stroke or died. \\nThere were also no clear differences for all comparisons between children and adults.\\nCertainty of the evidence In the comparison of the insulin analogues detemir and glargine with NPH insulin, we are moderately confident about the results for death, severe (night‐time) hypoglycaemia, serious unwanted effects and HbA1c levels. We are uncertain about the effects on heart attacks, stroke and health‐related quality of life, mainly because there were only a few studies which did not last long enough to reliably investigate these outcomes. \\nHow up to date is this review?This evidence is up‐to‐date as of 24 August 2020. \\n\", '10.1002-14651858.CD013190-pls.txt': 'What is the diagnostic accuracy of the imaging test reflectance confocal microscopy (RCM) for the detection of melanoma in adults? \\nWhat was the aim of the review? \\nThe aim of this Cochrane Review was to find out how accurate reflectance confocal microscopy (RCM) was on its own and used in addition to dermoscopy compared to dermoscopy alone for diagnosing melanoma. Review authors in Cochrane included 18 publications to answer this question. \\nWhy is improving the diagnosis of melanoma important? \\nMelanoma is one of the most dangerous forms of skin cancer. Not recognising a melanoma when it is present (called a false negative test result) delays surgery to remove it, risking cancer spreading to other parts in the body and possibly death. Diagnosing a skin lesion as a melanoma when it is not present (called a false positive result) may result in unnecessary surgery, further investigations, and patient anxiety. \\nWhat did the review study? \\nMicroscopic techniques are used by skin cancer specialists to allow a more detailed, magnified examination of suspicious skin lesions than can be achieved using the naked eye alone. Currently, dermoscopy (a handheld device using natural light) can be used as part of the clinical examination of suspicious skin lesions. RCM is a new microscopic technique (a handheld device or static unit using infrared light) that can visualise deeper layers of the skin compared to dermoscopy. Both techniques are painless procedures, but RCM is more expensive, time consuming, and requires additional training. Dermoscopy can be used by general practitioners whereas RCM is likely to only be used by secondary care specialists in people who have been referred with a lesion suspicious for skin cancer. We sought to find out whether RCM should be used instead of, or in addition to, dermoscopy, to diagnose melanoma in any suspicious skin lesion or only in particularly difficult to diagnose skin lesions. \\nWhat were the main results of the review? \\nThe review included 18 publications reporting data for 19 groups of participants with lesions suspected of melanoma. The main results were based on 16 of the 19 datasets (sets of information and results). \\nThe review included nine datasets with 1452 lesions in people with any suspicious skin lesion, three of which compared RCM to dermoscopy. The results suggested that in 1000 lesions, of which 300 (30%) actually are melanoma: \\n‐ an estimated 396 would have an RCM result indicating melanoma was present, and of these, 126 (32%) would not be melanoma (false positive results); ‐ in the same group of 1000 lesions, dermoscopy would produce 406 false positive results, meaning RCM would avoid unnecessary surgery in 280 lesions compared to dermoscopy; ‐ of the 604 lesions with an RCM result indicating that melanoma was not present (and 324 lesions with a dermoscopy result indicating that melanoma was not present), 30 would actually be melanoma (false negative results). This equated to a false negative rate of 5% for RCM and 9% for dermoscopy. \\nThe review also included seven datasets with 1177 lesions in people with particularly difficult to diagnose skin lesions, three of which compared RCM to dermoscopy. The results suggested that if skin specialists used RCM in a group of 1000 lesions, of which 200 (20%) were actually melanoma: \\n‐ an estimated 292 would have an RCM result indicating melanoma was present, and of these, 112 (38%) would not be melanoma (false positive results); ‐ in the same group of 1000 lesions, dermoscopy would produce 408 false positive results, meaning RCM would avoid unnecessary surgery in 296 lesions compared to dermoscopy; ‐ of the 708 lesions with an RCM result indicating that melanoma was not present (and 412 lesions with a dermoscopy result indicating that melanoma was not present), 20 would actually have melanoma (false negative results). This equates to a false negative rate of 3% for RCM and 5% for dermoscopy. \\nHow reliable were the results of the studies of this review? \\nIn all included studies, the diagnosis of melanoma was made by lesion biopsy (RCM/dermoscopy positive) (a biopsy involves taking a sample of body cells and examining them under a microscope), and the absence of melanoma was confirmed by biopsy or by follow‐up over time to make sure the skin lesion remained negative for melanoma (RCM/dermoscopy negative)*. This is likely to have been a reliable method for deciding whether people really had melanoma. Only a small number of studies compared the accuracy of dermoscopy and RCM. Most were conducted by specialist research teams with high levels of experience with RCM. Therefore, RCM may have appeared more accurate than it actually was. Participants in the nine studies of any suspicious lesion may have had very obvious disease compared to that seen in practice leading to a lower number of false positive results than would actually occur. It is not possible to recommend a definition of a positive RCM test that will reliably produce the results presented here due to differences between studies. \\nWho do the results of this review apply to? \\nEleven studies were undertaken in Europe (61%), with the remainder undertaken in Oceania, North America, or more than one continent. Mean age ranged from 39 to 54.7 years. The percentage of people with melanoma ranged between 1.9% and 41.5% (a median (midpoint reading) of 19% for difficult to diagnose skin lesions and 32% for any suspicious lesion). The majority of studies only included people with certain types of skin lesion. In many studies, it was not clear what tests participants had received before RCM. \\nWhat are the implications of this review? \\nRCM appears to be an accurate test for identifying melanoma, and it may reduce the number of people receiving unnecessary surgery by up to three‐quarters compared to dermoscopy. There is considerable variation and uncertainty in results and in study conduct, reducing the reliability of findings. Use of RCM may be of most benefit in people with particularly difficult to diagnose lesions rather than people with any lesion suspicious for melanoma. Further research comparing RCM and dermoscopy in well described groups of people with difficult to diagnose skin lesions is needed. \\nHow up‐to‐date is this review? \\nThe review authors searched for and used studies published up to August 2016.\\n*In these studies, biopsy or clinical follow‐up were the reference standards (means of establishing final diagnoses). \\n', '10.1002-14651858.CD009359.pub2-abstract.txt': 'Racecadotril to treat children under five years of age with acute diarrhoea\\nWhat was the aim of this review? \\nThe aim of this Cochrane Review was to find out whether racecadotril works for children under five years of age with diarrhoea. Cochrane Review authors collected and analysed all relevant trials to answer this question and included seven trials in this review. \\nKey messages \\nRacecadotril may reduce the risk of rehydration failure. We are uncertain whether or not it influences number of bowel movements or duration of diarrhoea. \\nWhat was studied in the review? \\nDiarrhoea is a leading cause of death in children under five years old, especially in low‐income countries. Children who have diarrhoea often suffer from frequent and watery bowel movements, which might cause excessive loss of fluid and electrolytes (dehydration). Fluid replacement is recommended to prevent and treat dehydration caused by diarrhoea. Racecadotril has been used in addition to fluid replacement for treating diarrhoea in children, as it reduces release of water and electrolytes into the digestive tract. The drug is supposed to improve the symptoms of diarrhoea (shorten duration of diarrhoea or reduce the stool frequency) as well as reduce the risk of rehydration failure. However, it is not clear if racecadotril really works for children with diarrhoea. \\nWhat are the main results? \\nThe review authors searched for available trials and included seven trials.

Giving blood thinners compared to not giving blood thinners might reduce the death rate. \\n‐ It is very likely that new studies will not change the evidence about the effects of different doses of blood thinners on death rate and minor bleeding. High‐quality studies are still needed to analyse the need for additional respiratory support, giving blood thinners compared to no blood thinners, comparing different blood thinners, and giving blood thinners for extended periods. \\nWhat is COVID‐19? \\nCOVID‐19 typically affects the lungs and airways; however, in addition to respiratory problems, about 16% of people hospitalised with COVID‐19 experience problems with their blood vessels, leading to blood clots forming in the arteries, veins and lungs. Nearly half of all people with severe COVID‐19 in intensive care units develop clots in their veins or arteries. \\nWhat are blood thinners? \\nBlood thinners are medicines that prevent harmful blood clots from forming (deep vein thrombosis). However, they can cause unwanted effects such as bleeding. Some guidelines recommend giving blood thinners when people are first admitted to hospital with COVID‐19 to prevent blood clots from developing, rather than waiting to see whether blood clots develop and then treating them with blood thinners. \\nWhat did we want to find out? \\nWe wanted to know whether giving blood thinners to people hospitalised with COVID‐19 as a preventive measure reduced the number of deaths compared to people who received no treatment or those who received a placebo treatment (an identical‐seeming treatment but with no active ingredient). We also wanted to determine whether these individuals needed less support with breathing, whether they still developed harmful blood clots, whether they experienced bleeding and whether they experienced any other unwanted events. \\nWhat did we do? \\nWe searched for studies that assessed blood thinners given to people hospitalised with COVID‐19 to prevent blood clots. Studies could be of any design as long as they compared a blood thinner with another blood thinner, no treatment or a placebo. Studies could take place anywhere in the world and participants could be any age as long as they were in hospital with confirmed COVID‐19 disease. We pooled the results when appropriate. \\nWhat did we find? \\nWe included seven studies with 16,185 people hospitalised with COVID‐19 in either intensive care units, hospital wards or emergency departments. Studies were from Brazil (2), Iran (1), Italy (1), and the USA (1), and two involved more than country. People in the studies were aged from 55 to 68 years on average. Studies lasted from 15 to 90 days and provided evidence on deaths, bleeding, blood clotting, length of hospital stay and unwanted effects. There was little or no evidence on need for respiratory support (help with breathing), deaths related to COVID‐19, and quality of life. \\nHigher‐dose of blood thinners compared with lower‐dose (4 studies, 4647 people)  In people who received higher compared to lower doses of blood thinners there was little to no difference in death rate. However, people on higher doses were more likely to experience minor bleeding compared to in those on lower doses. People who received higher doses of blood thinners likely had reduced pulmonary embolism (blood clot in the lung or blood vessel leading to the lung), slightly increased major (more severe) bleeding, and probably had little to no difference in time spent in hospital compared to those who received the lower doses of blood thinners. In people who received higher doses of blood thinners, there was little to no difference in the rate of deep vein thrombosis, and other unwanted events compared to those who received the lower dose of blood thinners. \\nBlood thinners compared with no treatment (3 studies, 11,538 people)  People who received blood thinners had a reduced death rate compared to those who did not receive blood thinners, but the evidence is very uncertain. \\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence? \\nWe are very confident that higher doses of blood thinners do not change the risk of death but do increase the risk of bleeding in people hospitalised with COVID‐19. \\nAlthough our confidence in the evidence is very limited, people who receive blood thinners may have a lower death rate compared to those who did not receive any blood thinners. \\nWhat happens next? \\nOur searches found 62 ongoing studies with 35,470 people.

Common symptoms include fever, diarrhoea, abdominal pain and weight loss. Crohn's disease is characterized by periods of relapse when people are actively experiencing symptoms and periods of remission when the symptoms stop. \\nWhat are Cannabis and Cannabinoids? \\nCannabis is a widely used drug which acts on the endocannabinoid system. Cannabis contains multiple components called cannabinoids. The use of cannabis and cannabis oil containing specific cannabinoids produces mental and physical effects such as altered sensory perception and euphoria when consumed. Some cannabinoids, such as cannabidiol, do not have a psychoactive effect. Cannabis and cannabidiol have some anti‐inflammatory properties that might help people with Crohn's disease. \\nWhat did the researchers investigate? \\nThe researchers studied whether cannabis is better than placebo (e.g. a sugar pill) therapy for treating adults with active Crohn's disease or Crohn's disease that is in remission. \\nWhat did the researchers find? \\nThe researchers extensively searched the literature up to 17 October 2018 and found three studies (93 participants) that met the inclusion criteria. One ongoing study was also identified. All of the studies were small in size and had some quality issues. One small study (21 participants) compared eight weeks of treatment with cannabis cigarettes containing 115 mg of D9‐tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) to placebo cigarettes containing cannabis with the THC removed in participants with active Crohn's disease who had failed at least one medical treatment. Although no difference in clinical remission rates was observed, more participants in the cannabis group had improvement in their Crohn's disease symptoms than participants in the placebo group. More side effects were observed in the cannabis cigarette group compared to placebo. These side effects were considered to be mild in nature and included sleepiness, nausea, difficulty with concentration, memory loss, confusion and dizziness. Participants in the cannabis cigarette group reported improvements in pain, appetite and satisfaction with treatment. \\nOne small study (22 participants) compared cannabis oil (10 mg of cannabidiol twice daily) to placebo oil (i.e. olive oil) in participants with active Crohn's disease who had failed at least one medical treatment. No difference in clinical remission rates was observed. There was no difference in serious side effects. Serious side effects included worsening Crohn's disease in one participant in each group. \\nOne small study (50 participants) compared cannabis oil (composed of 15% cannabidiol and 4% THC) to placebo oil in participants with active Crohn's disease.

No firm conclusions regarding the benefits and harms (e.g. side effects) of cannabis and cannabis oil in adults with Crohn's disease can be drawn. The effects of cannabis and cannabis oil in people with Crohn's disease in remission have not been investigated. Further studies with larger numbers of participants are required to assess the potential benefits and harms of cannabis in Crohn's disease. Future studies should assess the effects of cannabis in people with active and inactive Crohn's disease.

We included people with a break just below the ball and socket joint. These types of broken hip are common in older adults whose bones may be fragile because of a condition called osteoporosis. They often happen after a fall from a standing or sitting position. The broken hip can be treated in different ways, and we don't know whether some treatments are better than others. \\nWhat are the treatments? \\n‐ Replacing the broken hip with an artificial one. This can be done using a hemiarthroplasty (HA), which replaces only the ball part of the\\xa0joint, and can be unipolar (a single artificial joint) or bipolar which has an additional joint within the HA. A total hip arthroplasty (THA)\\xa0replaces\\xa0all of the hip joint, including the socket, and usually has just one artifical joint between the ball and the socket (single articulation) or sometimes two (dual‐mobility). All types of artificial joints can be fixed in place with or without bone cement. \\n‐ Using metal implants to fix the broken parts of the bones. Pins or screws may be inserted through the two parts of broken bone, or the surgeon may use a 'fixed angle plate' which sits on the outer edge of the broken bone and is attached to the bone with screws or pins.\\xa0 \\n‐ Treatment without an operation, usually requiring a period of rest in bed whilst the leg is held in position using traction with weights. \\nWhat did we do? \\nWe searched for studies that compared one or more of these treatments.

We combined the findings from studies, and created a 'network' (which is used when researchers perform a 'network meta‐analysis' on the results from studies) to see if we could find out if some treatments were better than others. \\nWhat did we find? \\nWe found 119 studies, involving 17,653 participants with 17,669 fractures.\\xa0The average age of study participants ranged from 60 to 87 years; 73% were women, which is usual for people who have this type of hip fracture. We included 75 of these studies in our 'network'. \\nWe found that a modern design of unipolar HA fixed with bone cement, or some of the metal implants (fixed angle plates and pins), seem to have the greatest chance of reducing the number of deaths within 12 months of injury. Compared to people having these treatments, more people who were treated with an uncemented modern bipolar design of HA or with a THA (single articulation) died.\\xa0 \\nWe didn't find as many studies to include in our 'network' for health‐related quality of life, and none of the treatments made a meaningful improvement to people's quality of life.\\xa0 \\nWe also found that people treated with any of the hip replacements were less likely to need additional surgery on their broken hip than people treated with metal implants or treated without an operation. Amongst all the designs of hip replacements, fewer people needed additional surgery after treatment with a cemented modern unipolar design of HA ‐ but there was not a big difference in the findings for these hip replacement treatments. \\nSo, overall, cemented modern hip replacements tended to produce better outcomes and may be a more successful approach than attempting to fix the broken bone. THA (single articulation) may have increased the risk of death compared with cemented HA, without leading to an important difference in quality of life ‐ but we are not sure about this finding. This type of THA may be an appropriate treatment for some people with these fractures, but we have not studied this in this review. \\nAre we confident in what we found? \\nThe true effects of these treatments might be very different to what we have found in this review. Many of the studies in this review were published before general reporting standards for research were improved, and so we could not be certain whether or not these studies were well‐conducted. Sometimes, the types of fractures were different (particularly between participants treated with metal implants and those treated with hip replacements), and this might have affected the results in the 'network'. We also found that the results included risks of potential benefits and harms, and this is often because there are not enough study participants to find a precise result. \\nHow up to date is this review? \\nWe ran our search in July 2020. \\xa0 \\xa0\\xa0\\n\", '10.1002-14651858.CD010497.pub2-abstract.txt': \"Oral fumaric acid esters for the treatment of psoriasis\\nBackground \\nPsoriasis is a long‐term inflammatory skin condition that can markedly reduce the quality of life of affected individuals. Treatments taken by mouth (oral treatments), such as methotrexate, ciclosporin, and acitretin, are commonly prescribed to people with moderate to severe psoriasis. Oral fumaric acid esters (FAE) are licensed for the treatment of psoriasis in Germany but remain unlicensed in most other countries. This means that there are different treatment options offered to people in different countries. \\nReview question \\nWhat is the available evidence for the benefits and risks of using FAE for treating psoriasis? \\nStudy characteristics \\nOur review included six randomised control trials (RCTs) that involved 544 participants. Five RCTs compared FAE with placebo, and one compared FAE with methotrexate. The outcomes we were interested in measuring were the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI), which is a psoriasis severity score, and the proportion of participants who discontinued treatment because of adverse (side) effects that are common but sufficiently serious that the drug had to be stopped, such as severe diarrhoea, infections, or cutaneous malignancy. \\nKey results \\nIt was difficult to pool and compare results because outcome measures differed between the studies. Three studies reported significant benefit with FAE when compared with placebo after 12 to 16 weeks of treatment, but we could not combine these results in a statistical analysis to show the overall difference. The included studies did not fully examine the chance of discontinuing FAE treatment because of adverse effects, which is uncertain. One study showed that individuals on FAE are nearly five times more likely to develop nuisance adverse effects; the most common were diarrhoea and abdominal cramps, flushing, reversible protein loss in the urine, and raised levels of eosinophil blood cells. Two RCTs were similar enough to allow the combination of their results and found that FAE were better than placebo when measured by the proportion of individuals who experienced at least a 50% improvement in their psoriasis severity score. One study reported improvement of individuals' quality of life with FAE in comparison with placebo, but the significance of this difference could not be calculated. The benefit of FAE was similar to methotrexate after 12 weeks when changes in disease severity from the start to the end of the trial were compared. The number of individuals experiencing nuisance adverse effects with these two treatments was not significantly different. The included studies, which were too small and of limited duration to provide evidence about rare or delayed effects, reported no serious adverse effects of FAE. \\nQuality of the evidence \\nThe risk of study bias, which means any factors that may systematically deviate away from the true findings, was unclear in most studies. This may be because most of the studies were conducted decades ago or were incompletely reported. Several analyses comparing FAE with placebo and methotrexate were limited because the studies were small or did not provide enough information to establish how these treatments compare with each other. Therefore, the overall quality of the evidence was low when comparing FAE with placebo and very low when comparing FAE with methotrexate. \\nFuture RCTs should use standard psoriasis outcome measures, including a validated quality of life scale, to enable the comparison and combination of results. They should be longer in duration or have longer follow‐up phases to provide evidence about any delayed adverse effects. \\n\", '10.1002-14651858.CD013320.pub2-pls.txt': 'Low levels of sugar to prevent cardiovascular disease\\nBackground \\nCardiovascular disease (CVD) is a group of disorders affecting the heart and blood vessels and the number one cause of death worldwide. It is important to detect modifiable risk factors and find strategies to prevent CVD. There are several established modifiable risk factors for developing CVD, one of them being eating an unhealthy diet rich in sugar. Sugar can be divided in two categories; sugars naturally occurring in food and sugars that are added to food. A high level of added sugar intake is suggested to cause weight gain and affect blood lipids, increasing the risk of CVD. This review assessed different levels of added sugars in the diet and the effect on cardiovascular events (e.g. heart attack or stroke), death, and CVD risk factors in healthy adults. \\nStudy characteristics \\nDatabases for randomised controlled trials (clinical trials in which participants are randomly assigned to either an experimental or a control treatment) were searched. The trials that were included compared different levels of added sugar intake and its effect on risk factors for CVD in healthy adults. People with previous CVD or diabetes were not included in the review. \\nKey results \\nTwenty‐one trials were found with 1110 participants. None of the trials looked at cardiovascular events or death. The trials reported on blood pressure, blood lipid levels and blood sugar levels. The review found that low levels of added sugar intake led to a small reduction in blood pressure and blood lipid levels, but no effect was seen on blood sugar. The evidence is current to July 2021. \\nQuality of the evidence \\nThe studies included in the review provide low‐quality evidence that low levels of added sugar in the diet indirectly reduces the risk of cardiovascular disease. More long‐term studies of high quality assessing effects of different levels of sugar on CVD risk factors, cardiovascular events and death are needed. \\n', '10.1002-14651858.CD014955-pls.txt': 'Can day care programs for children under 6 years of age in low‐ to middle‐income countries reduce their risk of drowning? \\nKey message \\nA day care program with extra features such as community‐based education, parent education, and playpens provided to parents outside the day care facility probably reduces the risk of death by drowning for children under 6 years living in areas where large numbers of children drown each year. \\nWhy did we do this Cochrane Review? \\nChildren living in rural areas near open water are at risk of drowning, particularly if they are not attending school or are left unsupervised. Child supervision is recommended to prevent drowning accidents, and organized day care at a center outside the home could help. \\nWe wanted to know if a day care program for children under 6 years of age in low‐ to middle‐income countries might help to reduce the number of drowning accidents (fatal and non‐fatal). \\nWhat did we do? \\nWe searched for studies that looked at the effects of a day care program on drowning accidents in children under 6 years of age. The day care program could include features such as educational activities aimed at preventing injuries or drowning and early childhood development activities. \\nHow up‐to‐date is this review? \\nWe included evidence published up to August 18, 2020.\\nWhat did we find? \\nWe found 2 studies that involved 252,631 children and took place in rural Bangladesh.\\nOne study lasted 4 years and 8 months. It assessed the effects of a day care program that combined parent education, playpens provided to parents, and community education as compared to the effects of no day care program. \\nThe other study lasted 3 years and 4 months. The effects of a day care program alone and the effects of a combined program of day care with playpens provided to parents were each compared with the effects of only playpens provided to parents. \\nWhat are the main results of our review? \\nCompared with no day care program, a day care program for children under 6 years of age, combined with parent education, playpens for parents, and community education, probably reduces the risk of death from drowning (evidence from 1 study in 136,577 children). For every 100,000 children under 6 years of age who were not in the day care program, 77 children might die from drowning, compared with 14 children included in the day care program. \\nProviding this day care program with additional activities was cheaper than the cost of every year lost to illness, disability, or early death by drowning (evidence from 1 study in 136,577 children). \\nWe are uncertain about the effects of a day care program when compared with playpens provided to parents, and we are uncertain about the effects of a day care program combined with playpens for parents when compared with playpens alone. \\nNeither study reported results on non‐fatal drowning accidents, unsafe water exposure, the safety of the program, or other accidental injuries. \\nLimitations of the evidence \\nThe results were from two observational studies in which researchers observed the effects of a factor (such as a day care program) without trying to change who did, or did not, experience it. Evidence from observational studies is not as reliable as evidence from randomized controlled studies, in which the programs people receive are decided at random. \\nWe are moderately confident about the effects of a day care program (with extra features) on the risk of death by drowning in children under 6 years of age. Further research is likely to increase our confidence in these results. \\n', '10.1002-14651858.CD013786.pub2-pls.txt': \"Accuracy of telehealth assessment for diagnosing dementia and mild cognitive impairment\\nBackground \\nDementia is an illness in which memory and other thinking skills deteriorate to the point that someone can no longer manage their daily activities without assistance. If the memory and thinking problems are milder, so that independent living is not affected, the condition is described as mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Both conditions usually affect older people. It is considered important that people with dementia or MCI can get an accurate diagnosis at a time and place suitable for them so that they and their families can understand the problem and can access treatment and support. However millions of people with dementia around the world never get a diagnosis. There are many reasons for this, but one may be a lack of accessible diagnostic services, particularly for people in rural areas or those who find it difficult to travel. During the COVID‐19 pandemic, many face‐to‐face services were closed. Telehealth ‐ the use of information and communication technology (ICT) to provide health services at a distance may be a way to increase access to specialist assessment for people with suspected dementia who cannot easily get to clinics. However, it is important to be sure that increased accessibility does not come at the expense of accuracy of diagnosis. \\nReview question \\nWe asked how accurate telehealth diagnoses of dementia and MCI were compared to diagnoses made when patients attend traditional clinics for a face‐to‐face assessment. \\nWhat we did \\nWe searched databases of medical studies up to 4 November 2020 for studies in which people had two assessments for suspected dementia or MCI: one telehealth assessment and one conventional face‐to‐face assessment. Both assessments were done by specialists and took place within a month of each other. For the telehealth assessment, all contact between the patient and the diagnosing specialist had to have been done remotely, using ICT, but some of the information needed to make the diagnosis could be collected by other members of the healthcare team who saw the patient in person. We then assessed how closely the results of the telehealth assessments agreed with the face‐to‐face assessments. \\nWhat we found \\nWe included three studies (136 participants) who had suspected dementia. One small study (16 participants) was conducted in veterans' homes in the USA; the other two studies were in community services in Australia. They all used videoconference systems for their telehealth assessments. All three studies aimed to make dementia diagnoses but only one also aimed to diagnose MCI. The quality of the studies was generally good. In two studies, nurses who saw the patients in person played a big role in gathering information used in both assessments, which could bias those studies towards close agreement between the assessments. \\nThe studies found that telehealth assessment correctly identified 80% to 100% of the people who were diagnosed with dementia at face‐to‐face assessment and also correctly identified 80% to 100% of people who did not have dementia. \\nOnly one study (100 participants) attempted to diagnose MCI. In this study, 71% of participants who had MCI and 73% of participants who did not have MCI were correctly identified using telehealth assessment. \\nTelehealth assessment in this study correctly identified 97% of the participants who had either MCI or dementia, but correctly identified only 22% of those who did not have either, although again this result was very uncertain because of the very small number of people in this category. \\nIt is important to note that diagnoses of dementia and MCI made by two specialists seeing patients face‐to‐face will not show 100% agreement. Therefore perfect agreement between telehealth and face‐to‐face assessments cannot be expected. \\nWhat we concluded \\nFrom the evidence we found, telehealth assessment for diagnosing dementia seems to have a good level of accuracy when compared to face‐to‐face assessment, although the small number of studies and participants and differences between the included studies means that there is a lot of uncertainty about this result. Telehealth appeared to be a little less accurate for diagnosing MCI than for diagnosing dementia. Agreement between two face‐to‐face assessments is also not perfect and we cannot say that disagreements between telehealth and face‐to‐face diagnoses were any more common. \\n\", '10.1002-14651858.CD015196.pub2-abstract.txt': 'The impact of cumulative medications with anticholinergic effects on future adverse clinical outcomes in people with dementia \\nKey messages \\nAnticholinergic medicines may increase the risk of death in older adults who have dementia. \\xa0However, the evidence is low certainty, and we cannot say for certain if the anticholinergic medicines cause death, or if they are simply more likely to be used by people who are already at an increased risk of dying due to ongoing health problems.\\xa0 \\nWe cannot draw firm conclusions for the risk that anticholinergic medicines pose to the development of other undesirable clinical outcomes, such as further deterioration of memory and thinking, or behavioural and psychological issues. \\xa0More research is needed to establish whether anticholinergic medicines cause unintended problems for older adults who have dementia. \\nWhat are anticholinergic medicines? \\nMedicines can be classified by their ability to block the action of a chemical signalling system in the body, called the cholinergic system. Medicines that do this are said to have anticholinergic effects, and therefore, are referred to as anticholinergic medicines. \\nWhat did we want to find out?\\xa0 \\nAnticholinergic medicines are commonly used to treat a number of medical conditions that people with dementia frequently experience. Typical examples are medicines used to treat urinary tract infections or episodes of agitation. However, because the cholinergic system in the brain plays an important role in learning, memory, and emotional regulation, there are theoretical reasons to believe that the use of anticholinergic medicines may unintentionally exacerbate psychological problems in this population. In this review, we investigated the link between anticholinergic medicines and future occurrence of undesirable clinical outcomes in people with dementia.\\xa0 \\nWhat did we do? \\nWe searched for studies that looked at the link between anticholinergic medicines and a range of clinical outcomes in people with dementia. We compared and summarised the results of identified studies and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors, such as study methods and sizes.\\xa0 \\nWhat did we find? \\nWe found a total of 18 studies, involving 102,684 adults aged 50 years or more, who had issues with memory and thinking. We found that the evidence was highly inconsistent regarding the link between anticholinergic medicines and increased issues with memory and thinking in people with dementia. There were no studies that investigated the link between anticholinergic medicines and frequency of behavioural disturbances. Therefore, we could not draw any conclusions about whether anticholinergic medicines cause issues with memory and thinking, or behavioural disturbances in this population. However, we did find there was a more consistent link between anticholinergic medicines and the risk of death. Those who were taking anticholinergic medicines had a 15% higher risk of dying than those who were not taking anticholinergic medicines. \\xa0 \\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence? \\nThe available evidence is very low certainty because of the inconsistency of study results, and the lack of control for health conditions that could be linked with both the clinical outcomes and the prescribing of anticholinergic medicines themselves. It is possible that anticholinergic medicines may not actually cause death, but are simply more likely to be given to people who are already at an increased risk of dying due to ongoing health problems. \\xa0 \\nHow up to date is this evidence? \\nWe searched for studies published up to 29 November 2021.\\n', '10.1002-14651858.CD007077.pub4-abstract.txt': \"Partial breast irradiation for early breast cancer\\nWhat is the issue? \\nBreast cancer is the most common cancer that women get.\\nWomen with early breast cancer who choose to keep their breast need to have radiotherapy (RT) as well as surgery to remove the cancer to make sure it does not regrow in the breast. RT is treatment with high energy x‐rays. Having RT for breast cancer usually means 15 to 30 visits to the RT department, five times per week. \\nIf breast cancer does regrow in the same breast (called local recurrence), it tends to come back in the area it was removed from. Women can also grow a new cancer (new 'elsewhere primary') in another part of the same breast. We are not sure if the RT given to stop cancer regrowth where the first cancer was, stops the growth of 'elsewhere primaries.' \\nWhy does it matter? \\nWe always want to treat the smallest area we can with RT because this means fewer side effects. Treating only part of the breast could mean that RT might be able to be used again in another part of the same breast if needed. New ways of giving RT mean that treating part of the breast can be done with fewer treatments. This is likely to be easier for women and cost less money. \\nWhat did we compare? \\nWe asked if giving RT to part of the breast (called partial breast irradiation (PBI)) is as good as giving RT to the whole breast. PBI can be given with a shortened treatment duration (called accelerated partial breast irradiation (APBI)). \\nFor this treatment to be acceptable, it would need to control the cancer as well as giving RT to the whole breast does. It would also be important that the PBI gives about the same side effects and breast appearance as treating the whole breast. \\nWhat did we find? \\nWe found nine studies, which involved 15,187 women. Our evidence is current to 27 August 2020. Local recurrence is probably slightly more common with APBI/PBI (moderate‐quality evidence) and the breast appearance (scored by doctors and nurses) was probably worse with APBI/PBI (moderate‐quality evidence). There is probably little difference in survival (high‐quality evidence). Late radiation fibrosis (change in breast appearance and feel) is probably increased with APBI/PBI. There are probably few differences in breast cancer‐related deaths and spread of breast cancer around the body with the use of APBI/PBI. The use of APBI/PBI makes little difference to how many women need mastectomy (removal of the whole breast) because of unacceptable late side effects or local recurrence. \\nWhat do our findings mean? \\nThis means that at the moment, PBI does not give the same cancer control in the breast as treating the whole breast, but the difference is small. It may cause worse side effects. There are seven big ongoing studies that will be important to answer this question. We hope to have a clearer answer in the next update of this review. \\n\", '10.1002-14651858.CD013180.pub2-pls.txt': \"Which is the best treatment for heavy menstrual bleeding?\\nKey results \\nEvidence suggests that the levonorgestrel‐releasing intrauterine system (LNG‐IUS) is the best first‐line option for reducing menstrual bleeding, while antifibrinolytics are probably the second best, and long‐cycle progestogens are the third best. Because of some limitations in the evidence, we are not sure what the true effect of these first‐line treatments is for the perception of improvement and satisfaction. \\nFor second‐line treatments, evidence suggests any type of hysterectomy is the best treatment for reducing bleeding, even though this is a major surgery, and resectoscopic endometrial ablation (REA) and non‐resectoscopic endometrial ablation (NREA) are second and third best. We are uncertain of the true effect of the second‐line treatments on amenorrhoea (absence of menstrual blood loss). Evidence suggests that minimally invasive hysterectomy results in a large increase in satisfaction, and NREA increases satisfaction, but we are uncertain of the true effect of the remaining interventions. \\nWhat is heavy menstrual bleeding? \\nHeavy menstrual bleeding is defined as excessive menstrual blood loss that interferes with the quality of life of people who menstruate. It is very common and can affect 20% to 50% of people who menstruate during their reproductive years. There are different treatments available, each with their own pros and cons. The best treatment depends on the person's age, whether they have or want to have children, their personal preferences, and their medical history, among other things. \\nWhat did we want to find out? \\nWe wanted to get an overview of all the published evidence on different treatments for heavy menstrual bleeding. We were most interested in finding out if the treatments were effective for reducing menstrual bleeding and for improving women's satisfaction. We also wanted to know how the treatment affected quality of life, what side effects it caused, and whether women required further treatment. \\nWhat did we do? \\nThis study is an overview of reviews, which means we looked for published studies that synthesised the results of other studies on different treatments for heavy menstrual bleeding. Then we tried to give a broad overview of all that evidence. We analysed the certainty of the evidence based on factors like study size and methodological rigour. We categorised the treatments based on patient characteristics, including the desire (intention) for future pregnancy, failure of previous treatment or having been referred for surgery. First‐line treatment included medical interventions and second‐line treatment included the LNG‐IUS plus surgical interventions; thus, the LNG‐IUS was included in both first‐ and second‐line treatments. We used network meta‐analysis, a statistical method that compares all the interventions at the same time, to find out which treatments produced the best results for patients. \\nWhat did we find? \\nWe found nine reviews with 104 studies, involving a total of 11,881 participants. Altogether, the data we analysed came from 85 trials and 9950 participants. The medical interventions included were: non‐steroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), antifibrinolytics (tranexamic acid), combined oral contraceptives (COC), combined vaginal ring (CVR), long‐cycle and luteal oral progestogens, the LNG‐IUS, ethamsylate and danazol (included only to provide indirect evidence). These were compared to placebo (sham treatment). The surgical interventions included were: open (abdominal), minimally invasive (vaginal or laparoscopic) and unspecified (or surgeon's choice of) route of hysterectomy, REA, NREA and unspecified endometrial ablation (EA). \\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence? \\nOur confidence in some evidence is moderate, but for most of it, our confidence is low to very low. The main reasons were because the studies were often not blinded, which means the participants knew which treatment they were receiving, and that could have changed their perception; the direct and indirect evidence was not similar enough to compare in the network; and the range of the results was too wide. \\nHow up to date is this evidence? \\nThe last search for reviews was in July 2021.\\n\", '10.1002-14651858.CD007176.pub2-abstract.txt': 'Antioxidant supplements for prevention of mortality in healthy participants and patients with various diseases \\nPrevious research on animal and physiological models suggests that antioxidant supplements have beneficial effects that may prolong life. Some observational studies also suggest that antioxidant supplements may prolong life, whereas other observational studies demonstrate neutral or harmful effects. Our Cochrane review from 2008 demonstrated that antioxidant supplements seem to increase mortality. This review is now updated. \\nThe present systematic review included 78 randomised clinical trials. In total, 296,707 participants were randomised to antioxidant supplements (beta‐carotene, vitamin A, vitamin C, vitamin E, and selenium) versus placebo or no intervention. Twenty‐six trials included 215,900 healthy participants. Fifty‐two trials included 80,807 participants with various diseases in a stable phase (including gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, neurological, ocular, dermatological, rheumatoid, renal, endocrinological, or unspecified diseases). A total of 21,484 of 183,749 participants (11.7%) randomised to antioxidant supplements and 11,479 of 112,958 participants (10.2%) randomised to placebo or no intervention died. The trials appeared to have enough statistical similarity that they could be combined. When all of the trials were combined, antioxidants may or may not have increased mortality depending on which statistical combination method was employed; the analysis that is typically used when similarity is present demonstrated that antioxidant use did slightly increase mortality (that is, the patients consuming the antioxidants were 1.03 times as likely to die as were the controls). When analyses were done to identify factors that were associated with this finding, the two factors identified were better methodology to prevent bias from being a factor in the trial (trials with ‘low risk of bias’) and the use of vitamin A. In fact, when the trials with low risks of bias were considered separately, the increased mortality was even more pronounced (1.04 times as likely to die as were the controls). The potential damage from vitamin A disappeared when only the low risks of bias trials were considered. The increased risk of mortality was associated with beta‐carotene and possibly vitamin E and vitamin A, but was not associated with the use of vitamin C or selenium.

Cochrane researchers searched, selected and analyzed all relevant studies to answer this question. We found 40 randomized controlled trials,that assessed MBI as a treatment for SUDs. \\nKey messages \\nSUD outcomes were monitored at different time points: directly following completion of the MBIs, and at follow‐up time points, which ranged from 3 months to 10 months after the MBI ended. Relative to other interventions (standard of care, cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), psychoeducation, support group, physical exercise, medication), MBIs may slightly reduce days with substance use, but it is very uncertain whether they reduce other SUD‐related outcomes. The effects of MBIs relative to no treatment was very uncertain across all SUD‐assessed outcomes, as was the risk for adverse events. \\nWhat was studied in this review? \\nSUDs are very common and associated with negative physical and psychological health outcomes. Although evidence‐based interventions exist for treating SUDs, the standard treatments may not be sufficient and many individuals relapse to substance use. In the past several decades, MBIs have been examined for the treatment of SUDs. MBIs involve training in mindfulness meditation practice, which emphasizes the cultivation of present‐moment, non‐judgmental awareness. MBIs may improve many of the psychological variables involved in substance use and relapse (i.e. depression, anxiety, stress, attention). We studied whether MBIs benefit individuals with SUDs. \\nWe searched for studies that compared an MBI to no treatment or to another treatment (e.g. cognitive behavior therapy, psychoeducation). We studied the results at the end of the intervention and at follow‐up assessments, which occurred 3 to 10 months following the end of the intervention. \\nWhat are the main results of this review? \\nThe review authors found 40 relevant studies, of which 45% were focused on individuals with various SUDs with the remaining studies including participants using a specific substance (e.g. alcohol, opioids). Of these 40 studies, 23 were conducted in the USA, 11 were conducted in Iran, two were conducted in Thailand, one was conducted in Brazil, one was conducted in China, one was conducted in Taiwan, and one was conducted in both Spain and the USA. We were able to analyze results of 35 studies composed of 2825 participants; the other five did not report usable results, and requests to the authors for more information were unsuccessful. \\nWhen MBIs were compared with other treatments, our review and analysis showed that MBIs may slightly reduce days with substance use at post‐treatment and follow‐up, and show similar study retention. The evidence is uncertain for other SUD‐related outcomes we assessed (continuous abstinence, consumed amount, craving intensity). When MBIs were compared with no treatment, the evidence was uncertain for all SUD‐related outcomes, although MBIs showed similar treatment retention.

Treatment with humour‐based interventions, such as watching humorous movies, funny videos, or comedies, has been proposed as an add‐on treatment that promotes health and wellness by stimulating a playful discovery, expression, or appreciation of the irrationality or inconsistency of life's situations. \\nSearching for evidence \\nWe ran an electronic search in February 2021 for trials that randomised people with schizophrenia to receive humour‐based interventions in addition to usual care, or to receive usual care only, another psychological intervention or a control condition. We found eight records and checked them for suitability to include in our review. \\nEvidence found \\nThree trials met the review requirements and two low‐quality trials (total number of participants = 96) provided useable data. Compared with active control, humour‐based interventions may not improve positive symptoms and anxiety, but may improve depressive symptoms. However, when compared with standard care, humour‐based intervention may not improve the depressive symptoms. Current evidence is very limited and is of low to very low quality. We are uncertain as to whether humour‐based interventions may lead to clinically‐important improvement in mental state or quality of life in people with schizophrenia. \\nConclusions \\nThere is insufficient research evidence to support the use of humour‐based interventions in people with schizophrenia. \\n\", '10.1002-14651858.CD013443.pub2-pls.txt': \"Medicines for preventing post‐traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)\\nWhy is this review important? \\nPost‐traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a severe and disabling condition which may develop in people exposed to traumatic events. Such events can have long‐lasting negative repercussions on the lives of those who have experienced them, as well as on the lives of loved ones. \\nResearch has shown that there are some alterations in how the brain works in people with PTSD. Some researchers have thus proposed using medicines to target these alterations soon after a traumatic event, as a way to prevent the development of PTSD. However, the majority of people who experience a traumatic event will not develop PTSD. Therefore, medicines that can be given soon after exposure to a traumatic event must be carefully evaluated for their effectiveness, including balancing the risk of side effects against the risk of developing PTSD. \\nWho will be interested? \\n‐ People exposed to traumatic events and their family, friends, and loved ones\\n‐ Professionals working in mental health\\xa0\\n‐ Professionals working in traumatology and emergency medicine\\n‐ People caring for victims of traumatic experiences and veterans of the armed forces\\nWhat questions did this review try to answer? \\nFor people exposed to a traumatic event, whether or not they have psychological symptoms, are some medicines more effective than other medicines or placebo (dummy pills) in: \\n‐ reducing the severity of symptoms of PTSD?\\n‐ reducing the number of people stopping the medication because of side effects?\\n‐ reducing the probability of developing PTSD?\\nWhich studies were included? \\nWe searched scientific databases for studies in which participants were randomly assigned to a medicine with the aim of preventing PTSD and its symptoms or reducing severity. We included studies published up until November 2020. We selected studies in adults who had experienced any kind of traumatic event, and which provided treatment, regardless of whether or not the participants had psychological symptoms. \\nWe included 13 studies, with a total of 2023 participants. One study alone contributed 1244 participants. The studies took place in different settings and involved people exposed to a wide range of traumatic events. Some studies took place in emergency departments and considered people whose trauma resulted from intentional harm or unintentional harm. Other studies focused on life‐threatening illness as the source of trauma, including major surgeries or being admitted to intensive care units. The medicines most commonly given to participants in the studies included: hydrocortisone (which reduces the body's immune response), propranolol (used to treat heart problems and anxiety, amongst other conditions), and gabapentin (a medicine primarily used to treat seizures and nerve pain). \\nWhat did the evidence tell us? \\nWe found four trials comparing hydrocortisone to placebo. These trials did not report how participants were doing at three months after a traumatic event, a time point that is usually useful to assess the evolution of PTSD symptoms. \\nWe found very low‐certainty evidence about propranolol compared to placebo three months after a traumatic event. This evidence does not tell us whether or not propranolol is more effective than placebo in reducing the severity of PTSD symptoms and the probability of developing PTSD. We did not find evidence on the probability of people stopping the medication because of side effects, quality of life, or functional disability (a measure of how much one’s life is limited by symptoms). \\nWe found very low‐certainty evidence about gabapentin compared to placebo three months after a traumatic event. This evidence does not tell us whether or not gabapentin is more effective than placebo in reducing the severity of PTSD symptoms and the probability of developing PTSD. We did not find evidence on the probability of people stopping the medication because of side effects, quality of life, or functional disability. \\nWe found studies on additional medicines, for which information about the reduction of PTSD severity and the probability of people stopping the medication was either inconclusive or missing. \\nNone of the included studies measured the functional disability of participants.\\nWhat should happen next? \\nThe evidence we found does not support the use of any medicines for the prevention of PTSD in people exposed to a traumatic event, regardless of whether or not they have psychological symptoms. More higher quality studies involving more people are needed to draw conclusions about these treatments. \\n\", '10.1002-14651858.CD003459.pub4-abstract.txt': \"Methotrexate for treatment of active treatment resistant Crohn's disease\\nAlthough corticosteroids are effective for induction of remission of Crohn's disease, many patients relapse when steroids are withdrawn or become steroid dependent. Furthermore, corticosteroids exhibit significant side effects. Methotrexate is an immunosuppressive drug that is used to treat active treatment resistant Crohn's disease. This review includes seven randomized trials with a total of 495 participants. There is evidence from one large study which suggests that methotrexate (25 mg/week) injected intramuscularly for 16 weeks among patients with active treatment resistant Crohn's disease may provide a benefit for induction of remission and complete withdrawal from steroids. This reduction in steroid use could reduce steroid‐induced side effects for people with chronic Crohn's disease. Although side effects are more common with high dose methotrexate therapy, no serious side effects have been observed. Common side effects associated with methotrexate therapy include nausea and vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea, skin rash and headache. Studies comparing lower dose oral methotrexate (12.5 to 15 mg/week) to placebo (e.g. sugar pill) or other active drugs (e.g. azathioprine or 6‐mercaptopurine) indicate that lower dose oral methotrexate does not appear to provide any benefit for treatment of active treatment resistant Crohn's disease. However, these trials were small in size and further studies of oral methotrexate may be justified. Two studies looked at the combination of methotrexate and infliximab (a biological drug) compared to infliximab therapy alone. These studies indicated that the addition of methotrexate to infliximab therapy does not appear to provide any additional benefit over infiximab. However these studies were relatively small and further research is needed to determine the role of methotrexate when used in conjunction with infliximab or other biological therapies. \\n\", '10.1002-14651858.CD013245.pub2-pls.txt': \"Adding abiraterone acetate to androgen deprivation therapy for the treatment of metastatic hormone‐sensitive prostate cancer \\nReview question \\nThe aim of this review was to find out what the effect of adding abiraterone was, in men with prostate cancer, who were receiving and still responding to hormone therapy. \\nBackground \\nAbiraterone acetate is a medication that blocks the effect of male sex hormones, and thereby, slows down prostate cancer growth.\\xa0 \\nMore than 15% of men diagnosed with prostate cancer present with disease that has spread beyond the prostate. Another 15% to 30% of men who undergo primary treatment will experience a return of their cancer. Hormone therapy (drugs to reduce the level of male hormones) has been the main treatment for advanced disease, but this does not work forever. Recent studies have looked at whether drugs that block the growth of prostate cancer cells, such as abiraterone acetate, can improve how men do. \\nStudy characteristics \\nWe found two studies (specifically, studies in which 'chance' decided what treatment men got), with a total of 2201 men. The studies compared abiraterone acetate and hormone therapy to hormone therapy alone. In one of the studies, most of the included men had high risk prostate cancer, and had previously undergone local treatment. In the other study, most men had not had previous treatment to their prostate.\\xa0The evidence is current to 15 May 2020. \\nKey results \\nAdding abiraterone acetate to hormone therapy improves overall survival but probably not quality of life. It\\xa0probably improves cancer‐specific survival and\\xa0reduces disease progression. However, there is also an increase in severe and life‐threatening side effects, likely leading to discontinued treatment, with the addition of abiraterone acetate. \\nQuality of the evidence \\nWe judged the certainty of the evidence to be high for overall survival (time to death from any cause), and severe and life‐threatening side effects. This means that our estimates are likely to be close to the actual effect for these outcomes. The certainty of the evidence was moderate for quality of life, cancer‐specific survival (time to death from prostate cancer), time to disease progression, and discontinued treatment due to adverse events. This means that our estimates are likely to be close to the actual effect, but there were some limitations in the studies that reduced our confidence in the results. \\n\", '10.1002-14651858.CD013210.pub2-pls.txt': \"Interventions for maintaining surgically included remission in Crohn's disease\\nWhat is the aim of this review? \\nThe aim of this Cochrane Review was to find out which drugs are most effective for maintaining remission in people with Crohn's disease who have undergone surgery to achieve remission. We collected and analysed all relevant studies to answer this question. We examined these studies using a method known as network meta‐analysis (NMA) in order to compare and rank all the treatments in terms of clinical relapse, endoscopic relapse and safety. \\nWhat was studied in the review? \\nCrohn's disease is a chronic disease of the gut. It is known to change from periods when people experience a flare‐up of the disease (relapse) to periods of good health (remission). Symptoms include abdominal pain, diarrhoea and weight loss. People with Crohn's disease may undergo surgery to remove diseased parts of their gut and achieve remission. However, their symptoms return after a while. Different drugs can be given to ensure that people with Crohn's disease remain in remission for as long as possible. These drugs include mesalazine, antibiotics, corticosteroids, and adalimumab, amongst others. Whilst these drugs have been known to reduce inflammation (pain and swelling) in the gut, side effects can occur with their use. We attempted to find out which treatments are the safest and most effective for maintaining remission in people with Crohn's disease after surgery. \\nHow up‐to‐date is the review? \\nWe searched for studies published up to 15 January 2019.\\nWhat are the main results of the review? \\nWe included 35 relevant trials, which were published between 1976 and 2018. The studies included a total of 3249 participants who were mostly adults. Our NMA included 26 studies (2581 participants) and compared nine groups of treatments such as 5‐aminosalicylic acid, adalimumab, antibiotics, budesonide, infliximab, probiotics, purine analogues, sulfasalazine, and a combination of sulfasalazine and prednisolone, which are used in preventing relapse after surgery in people with Crohn's disease. Adalimumab may reduce the chance of clinical relapse compared with placebo (dummy treatment). 5‐aminosalicylic acid probably reduces the chance of clinical relapse compared with placebo. Budesonide may not be effective in preventing clinical relapse. The entire network evidence is of low certainty due to the small number of participants included in the studies and high risk of bias. This means that are confidence in these results is limited. Research to understand the effect of the treatments on endoscopic relapse and safety was limited, however cases of pancreatitis and leukopenia were reported in participants who received purine analogues. \\nKey messages \\nWe uncertain about which treatments are most effective in preventing postoperative relapse in Crohn's disease. Alhough there is limited research on the harms (side effects) of these treatments, there were reported instances of pancreatitis and leukopenia in participants who received purine analogues. \\n\", '10.1002-14651858.CD013447-pls.txt': \"What are clients' experiences and perceptions of receiving health information via their mobile phones? \\nWhat is the aim of this synthesis? \\nThe aim of this Cochrane qualitative evidence synthesis was to explore clients' views and experiences of being communicated with by the health system through their mobile phone. Our synthesis looked at communication about pregnancy, newborn, and child health, sexual health, and family planning. By synthesis we mean the bringing together and synthesising of results from primary qualitative studies into a larger whole. We collected all relevant studies and included 35 studies in the synthesis. \\nThis synthesis links to other Cochrane Reviews that assess the effectiveness of this type of targeted digital health communication. \\nKey messages \\nMany clients like receiving messages from the health services by mobile phone. However, some clients have problems receiving messages due to lack of network access, internet, or phone, or language, reading, or privacy issues. Clients' experiences are also influenced by message timing, frequency, content, and sender. \\nWhat did we study in the synthesis? \\nGovernments and health systems are starting to use mobile phones to communicate with clients. When the information is targeted at particular people or groups of people, and when the health system decides when and what to communicate, this is called 'digital targeted client communication.' Common types of digital targeted client communication are text messages that remind people to go to appointments or to take their medicines. Other types include phone calls or video messages that offer healthcare information, advice, monitoring, and support. \\nWe looked for studies of clients' views and experiences of targeted communication by mobile phone. We focused on communication with pregnant women and parents of young children, and with adults and teenagers about sexual health and family planning. \\nWhat are the main findings of the synthesis? \\nWe included 35 studies from around the world. These studies showed that clients' experiences of these types of programmes were mixed. Some felt that these programmes provided them with feelings of support and connectedness, as they felt that someone was taking the time to send them messages (moderate confidence in the evidence). Others also described sharing the messages with their friends and family (moderate confidence). \\nHowever, clients also pointed to problems when using these programmes. Some clients had poor access to cell networks and to the internet (high confidence). Others had no phone, had lost or broken their phone, could not afford airtime, or had changed their phone number (moderate confidence). Some clients, particularly women and teenagers, had their access to phones controlled by others (moderate confidence). The cost of messages could also be a problem, and many thought that messages should be free of charge (high confidence). Languages issues as well as clients' skills in reading, writing, and using mobile phones could also be a problem (moderate confidence). \\nClients dealing with stigmatised or personal health conditions such as HIV, family planning, or abortion care were concerned about privacy and confidentiality (high confidence). Some suggested strategies to deal with these issues, such as using neutral language and tailoring the content, timing, and frequency of messages (high confidence). \\nClients wanted messages at a time and frequency that was convenient for them (moderate confidence). They had preferences for different delivery channels (e.g. short message service (SMS) or interactive voice response) (moderate confidence). They also had preferences about message content, including new knowledge, reminders, solutions, and suggestions about health issues (moderate confidence).

Cannabis‐based medicines refer to the use of Cannabis, or its ingredients called cannabinoids, as medical therapies to alleviate spasticity, chronic pain and other symptoms in MS.

The World Health Organization (WHO) currently recommends that school children in many areas are regularly treated with drugs which kill these worms. Some advocates claim such programmes improve child growth, haemoglobin, cognition, school attendance, school performance, physical fitness, and survival. \\nWhat the research says \\nIn populations of children living in endemic areas, the effect of the first, single dose of deworming drugs on weight is unclear. There was little or no effect in most studies, except for a large effect detected from one study area in Kenya, reported in two trials carried out over 30 years ago in a school where children were heavily infected with worms. This causes uncertainty, which means we do not know if a first dose or single dose of deworming impacts on weight. For height, most studies showed little or no effect, with the exception of the site in Kenya. A single dose of deworming medicine probably has no effect on haemoglobin and cognition. There is insufficient data to know if there is an effect on school attendance, school performance, or physical fitness or mortality. \\nIn studies where children were regularly treated with deworming medicine there was little or no effect on weight in all but two trials, irrespective of whether children were heavily infected with worms or not. The two trials with large average weight gains included the Kenya study carried out over 30 years ago, and one study from India carried out over 20 years ago in a low worm burden area where later studies in the same area did not show an effect. In trials from 2000 onwards, which are more relevant given the global reduction in worm burden, there is little or no effect. This causes uncertainty and means we do not know if regularly treating children with deworming medicine improves their weight. Regularly deworming children probably has no effect on height, haemoglobin, cognition, and mortality. We do not know if there is an impact on school attendance, since the evidence is inconsistent and at high risk of bias.

Non‐pharmacological care is the first treatment for symptoms of withdrawal. If symptoms worsen despite non‐pharmacological care, a medication such as morphine, methadone, or buprenorphine is the second treatment to reduce symptoms. Though non‐pharmacological care is the first approach to symptom management, it is not the same at every hospital. We wanted to discover whether one or more non‐pharmacological care practices benefit newborns with opioid withdrawal after birth. \\nStudy characteristics \\nWe looked at randomized controlled trials (RCTs; clinical studies where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups) of opioid‐exposed newborns treated with one or more non‐pharmacological care practice. Non‐pharmacological care practices include changes to the environment to reduce stimulation or provide soothing, changes to feeding frequency or type, changes that increase maternal care of the newborn or maternal wellness, and multiple changes such as occur in a new site or system of care. Search is up to date as of October 2019. \\nKey results \\nThis review included six RCTs that enrolled 353 opioid‐exposed newborns. The studies were published between 1975 and 2018. We also identified seven ongoing studies that may qualify for inclusion at review update when complete. \\nOf the six RCTs, four assessed changes to the environment to reduce stimulation or provide soothing. These studies examined the effect of a mechanical rocking bed, prone positioning (lying on tummy), non‐oscillating waterbed, and a low‐stimulation nursery. We are uncertain whether modifying environmental stimulation is associated with length of hospitalization based on one study with 30 infants. Modifying environmental stimulation may be associated with little or no difference in use of pharmacological treatment based on three studies with 92 infants. We are uncertain whether modifying environmental stimulation is associated with weight nadir (lowest weight recorded during birth hospitalization) based on one study with 194 infants. \\nOne study assessed a change to the feeding type comparing higher‐calorie formula to standard‐calorie formula. We are uncertain whether feeding practices are associated with use of medicines, days to regain birth weight, or weight nadir based on one study with 46 infants. \\nOne study assessed changes to support the mother with tailored breastfeeding support.

Multiple trials have assessed the potential for exercise training to improve the condition of adults undergoing dialysis, but no consensus has been reached. \\nWhat did we do? \\nWe searched the medical literature for all randomised trials that assessed structured exercise programs in people undergoing dialysis.

The exercise training programs lasted from eight weeks to two years and most often took place three times a week during the dialysis treatment. We could not determine the impact of exercise training on death, cardiovascular events (such as a heart attack) or mental well‐being. Moderate certainty evidence suggested that exercise training of any type is likely to improve depressive symptoms in adults undergoing dialysis, particularly when the exercise was maintained for longer than four months. Moderate quality evidence also suggested that exercise training may improve people's capacity to perform activities and tasks through the improvement of their capacity to walk and the strength and endurance of their legs. Exercise training may also improve fatigue and the physical aspects of quality of life, but the quality of the evidence was low. We could not conclude on the effect of exercise training on a person's mental well‐being. \\nConclusionsExercise training for people undergoing maintenance dialysis is likely to improve depression and their capacity to perform activities and tasks. Exercise training may also improve fatigue and pain sightly. Exercise training may improve the physical aspects of quality of life, but it is unclear whether it improves a person's mental well‐being.

Review authors in Cochrane included 10 studies to answer this question. \\nWhy is improving the diagnosis of BCC or cSCC important? \\nThere are a number of different types of skin cancer. BCC and cSCC are usually localised skin cancers. Making the correct diagnosis is important because mistaking one skin cancer for another can lead to the wrong treatment being used or lead to a delay in effective treatment. A missed diagnosis of BCC (known as a false‐negative result) can result in the missed BCC growing and causing disfigurement. A missed diagnosis of cSCC is more serious as it could spread to other parts of the body. Diagnosing a skin cancer when it is not actually present (a false‐positive result) may result in unnecessary biopsy or treatment and can cause discomfort and worry to patients. \\nWhat was studied in the review? \\nMicroscopic techniques are used by skin cancer specialists to provide a more detailed, magnified examination of suspicious skin lesions than can be achieved using the naked eye alone. Currently, dermoscopy is used by doctors as part of the examination of suspicious skin lesions. RCM is a new microscopic technique to increase the magnification. It is a hand‐held device or static unit using infrared light that can visualise deeper layers of the skin when compared with dermoscopy. Both techniques are painless procedures, but RCM is more expensive, time consuming, and requires additional specialised training. Dermoscopy can be used by general practitioners (GP) whereas RCM is likely to only be used by hospital specialists for people who have been referred with a skin lesion that is suspected to be a skin cancer. We wanted to see if RCM should be used instead of, or as well as, inspection of a skin lesion with the naked eye alone or using dermoscopy to diagnose BCC or cSCC. The accuracy of the test was looked at when used on people with any suspicious skin lesion and also in people with skin lesions that were tricky to diagnose. \\nWhat are the main results of the review? \\nWe found 10 studies that included information on 11 groups of people with lesions suspicious for skin cancer. The main results were based on seven of the 11 sets of data: four in any lesion suspicious for skin cancer and three in particularly difficult to diagnose skin lesions. \\nFor the comparison of RCM versus dermoscopy, we found four sets of data that included 912 suspicious skin lesions. The results suggested that in a group of 1000 people with any suspicious lesion, of whom 125 (12.5%) really do have BCC: \\n‐ an estimated 139 people will have an RCM result indicating BCC is present;\\n‐ of these, 44 (32%) people will not have BCC (false‐positive results) including one person with a melanoma mistaken for a BCC; \\n‐ of the 861 people with an RCM result indicating that BCC is not present, 30 (3%) will actually have BCC. \\nThe review also included three sets of data on people that had 668 particularly difficult to diagnose skin lesions, one comparing RCM to dermoscopy. The results suggested that if RCM was to be used by skin specialists in a group of 1000 people, of whom 150 (15%) really do have BCC: \\n‐ an estimated 269 people will have an RCM result indicating BCC is present;\\n‐ of these, 128 (48%) people will not have a BCC (known as a false‐positive result), including as many as 19 people with melanomas mistaken for BCCs; \\n‐ of the 732 people with an RCM result indicating that BCC is not present, nine (1%) will actually have BCC. \\nThere was not enough evidence to determine the accuracy of RCM for the detection of cSCC in either population group. \\nHow reliable are the results of this review? \\nThere was a lot of variation in the results of the studies in this review. Poor reporting of study conduct made assessment of the reliability of studies difficult. It was unclear whether studies were representative of populations eligible for testing with RCM, and test interpretation was often undertaken using images, remotely from the patient and the interpreter blinded to clinical information that would normally be available in practice. Only one study compared the accuracy of dermoscopy and RCM. Most studies were conducted by specialist research teams with high levels of training and experience with RCM, meaning that RCM may appear better than it would be when used in everyday practice. Most studies reported diagnosis based on observers' subjective views, which might not be the same for people using the technique in everyday practice. In nine studies, the diagnosis of skin cancer was made by a skin biopsy or by following up those people over time to make sure they remained negative for skin cancer*. This is likely to have been a reliable method for deciding whether patients really had skin cancer. In one study, the absence of skin cancer was made by experts looking at the skin, a method that may be less reliable for deciding whether patients really had skin cancer. \\nWho do the results of this review apply to? \\nFive studies were carried out in Europe (61%), and the rest in Asia, Oceania, North America, or more than one continent. The average ages of people who took part ranged from 41 to 65 years. The percentage of people with BCC in these studies ranged from 6% to 83% (a middle value of 12% for any suspicious lesion and 15% for difficult to diagnose skin lesions). For studies of RCM used for cSCC, the percentage of people with cSCC ranged between 4% and 13%. In many studies it was not clear what tests people taking part had received before RCM. \\nWhat are the implications of this review? \\nThere was not enough good evidence to support the use of RCM for the diagnosis of BCC or cSCC outside of research studies. There was a lot of variation and uncertainty in results and in the ways studies were carried out, reducing the reliability of findings. Using RCM might avoid the need for a diagnostic biopsy in people who see a doctor with a high suspicion of a BCC lesion, but more research is needed to confirm this. Such research should compare RCM to dermoscopy in well‐described groups of people with suspicious skin lesions and they must say whether other skin cancers end up being missed or being wrongly classified as BCC. \\nHow up‐to‐date is this review? \\nThe review authors searched for and used studies published up to August 2016.\\n*In these studies, biopsy or clinical follow‐up were the reference standards (means of establishing final diagnoses). \\n\", '10.1002-14651858.CD008215.pub3-abstract.txt': 'Is there an increased risk of ovarian cancer in women treated with drugs for subfertility?\\nBackground Drugs to stimulate ovulation have been used to treat subfertility since the early 1960s. There is uncertainty about the safety of these drugs and their potential risk of causing cancer. Moreover, it has already been shown that infertility itself increases the risk of ovarian cancer. \\nThe aim of the review We aimed with this updated systematic review to summarise current published research on the risk of ovarian cancer in subfertile women treated with fertility drugs compared to the general population and to subfertile women not treated with fertility drugs. \\nWhat are the main findings? Overall, based on 37 studies, which included a total of 4,684,724 women, we did not find enough strong evidence suggesting a potentially higher risk of ovarian cancer in women treated with fertility drugs. \\nA cumulative analysis of 12 case‐control studies from the USA revealed increased risk of ovarian cancer in women using fertility drugs, and this risk was higher in nulliparous women (women who have not given birth) when compared to multiparous women (women who have given birth to more than one child). One of the 37 included studies reported a two‐fold increase in development of serous borderline ovarian tumour in women after more than four cycles of progesterone; however the number of cases included in this group was very small. One cohort study also suggested an increased risk of borderline ovarian tumour in infertile women treated with clomiphene citrate when compared to infertile women who did not undergo treatment to conceive. \\nQuality of the evidence Studies showing an increase in the risk of ovarian cancer were of low methodological quality, with short follow‐up periods and with lack of adjustment for important confounding factors; therefore the results are too unreliable. However, compared with older studies, recent studies have tended to report both the dose and the number of cycles of infertility drugs and have included more contemporary drug regimens; this has made the final results more reliable. \\nWhat are the conclusions? Infertility has been found to be an important risk factor for ovarian cancer. However, the association between infertility drugs and ovarian cancer needs to be addressed with consideration of other factors such as age, body mass index, parity, genetic factors (i.e. family history for ovarian cancer), and aetiology of the infertility, along with longer follow‐up times. \\n', '10.1002-14651858.CD013433.pub2-pls.txt': 'Bone marrow cells in non‐ischaemic dilated cardiomyopathy\\nReview question \\nAre bone marrow cells safe and effective as a treatment for non‐ischaemic dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM)? \\nBackground \\nDCM is a disorder of the heart muscle with heart dilation (heart muscle becomes stretched) and impaired contraction, in the absence of high blood pressure, damaged or diseased heart valves, or heart disease present at birth or related to myocardial infarction (heart attack). The current standard of treatment is based on medicines and cardiac devices. However, DCM is still one of the leading causes of heart transplantation in adults. \\nStem cells are special cells produced in the bone marrow that are able to develop into many different cell types. Giving stem cells directly into the heart muscle has been proposed as an alternative treatment to reduce or stop further deterioration in heart function in people with DCM. \\nStudy characteristics \\nWe selected randomized controlled trials (RCTs; clinical studies where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups) comparing the infusion of bone marrow‐derived stem cells into the heart muscle with the usual‐care (control) treatment in people diagnosed with DCM. We searched multiple databases for trials up to 10 November 2020. \\nWe included 13 RCTs involving 762 participants (452 receiving stem cell therapy and 310 controls). The trials included people with severe symptoms of ischaemic (following a heart attack) and non‐ischaemic DCM. We selected only the data from non‐ischaemic DCM. \\nThe studies included an average of 60 people aged about 45 to 58.5 years and 50% to 89% men in each trial. Following therapy, the participants were assessed for six months to five years, with most at one year. One study declared a private funding whereas seven others had public or governmental funding, two had non‐profit funding, and four did not report this information. \\nKey results \\nSCT versus control: very low‐quality evidence reflects uncertainty regarding mortality, procedural complications, health‐related quality of life and exercise capacity. Low‐quality evidence suggests that SCT may slightly improve deterioration of heart function and may not increase the risk of abnormal heartbeats in people with DCM. No studies reported other relevant outcomes such as major cardiac adverse events. \\nSTC plus cytokine versus control: very low‐quality evidence reflects uncertainty regarding mortality. Low‐quality evidence suggests that SCT plus cytokine may not improve health‐related quality of life but may improve exercise capacity as well as some physiological measures related to cardiac function (although it is unclear to what extent these latter outcomes are associated with relevant clinical benefits for patients). Hence, the results should be interpreted with caution. Very low‐quality evidence reflects uncertainty regarding procedural complications. No studies reported major cardiac adverse events or abnormal heartbeats. \\nDue to the limited number of studies we could not perform analyses to identify which specific features of SCT and clinical characteristics of patients are associated with better results. Thus, more research is needed to establish the role of SCT in the treatment of DCM and the most effective therapies. \\nQuality of evidence \\nThe evidence in this review is of low to very low quality due to the small number of events, results not similar across studies, risk of bias, and issues with study design. Furthermore, the limitations in the reporting of most studies made it difficult to obtain and use the information to reach clearer conclusions. \\n', '10.1002-14651858.CD012019-abstract.txt': 'Urinary biomarkers for the non‐invasive diagnosis of endometriosis\\nReview Question \\nHow accurate are urine test in detecting endometriosis? Can any urine test be accurate enough to replace or reduce the need for surgery in the diagnosis of endometriosis? \\nBackground \\nWomen with endometriosis have endometrial tissue (the tissue that lines the womb and is shed during menstruation) growing outside the womb within the pelvic cavity. This tissue responds to reproductive hormones causing painful periods, chronic lower abdominal pain and difficulty conceiving. Currently, the only reliable way of diagnosing endometriosis is to perform laparoscopic surgery and visualise the endometrial deposits inside the abdomen. Because surgery is risky and expensive, urine tests have been evaluated for their ability to detect endometriosis non‐invasively. An accurate urine test could lead to the diagnosis of endometriosis without the need for surgery; or it could reduce the need for diagnostic surgery, so only women who were most likely to have endometriosis would require it. Other non‐invasive ways of diagnosing endometriosis using blood, imaging, endometrial and combination tests are evaluated in separate Cochrane reviews from this series. \\nStudy characteristics \\nThe evidence included in this review is current to July 2015. We included eight studies involving 646 participants. All studies evaluated reproductive‐aged women who were undertaking diagnostic surgery to investigate symptoms of endometriosis or for other indications. Five studies evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of four urinary biomarkers, including four biomarkers that were expressed differently in women with and without endometriosis and one showing no difference between the two groups. Three other studies just identified three biomarkers that did not distinguish the two groups. \\nKey results \\nNone of the assessed biomarkers, including cytokeratin 19 (CK 19), enolase 1 (NNE), vitamin D binding protein (VDBP) and urinary peptide profiling have been evaluated by enough studies to provide a meaningful assessment of test accuracy. None of the tests were accurate enough to replace diagnostic surgery. Several studies identified biomarkers that might be of value in diagnosing endometriosis, but there are too few reports to be sure of their diagnostic benefit. There is not enough evidence to recommend any urinary biomarker for use in clinical practice for the diagnosis of endometriosis. \\nQuality of the evidence \\nGenerally, the reports were of low methodological quality and urine tests were only assessed in small individual studies. \\nFuture research \\nMore high quality research trials are needed to accurately assess the diagnostic potential of urinary biomarkers identified in small numbers of studies as having value in detecting endometriosis. \\n', '10.1002-14651858.CD014698-pls.txt': \"Routine ultrasound scans for babies before 24 weeks of pregnancy.\\nWe set out to determine the effect of routine ultrasound scans early in pregnancy (before 24 weeks). This was in comparison to no scan at all, or scans only when a clinical problem was suspected, such as if the woman has vaginal bleeding, or the baby is at high risk of having an abnormality. \\nWhat is the issue? \\nUltrasound scans send out high‐frequency sound waves directed to the area being examined, and use the reflected sound to make an image. This review considers two types of scan in the first half of pregnancy. \\xa0Early scans (before 14 weeks) mainly aim to count the number of babies, to check they are growing in the correct place and check the pregnancy dates. \\xa0Later scans, typically done around 18 to 24 weeks, recheck all the above, and also examine the baby's anatomy and whether the placenta (afterbirth) is in the correct place.\\xa0Both types of scan may cause parental anxiety and a false positive diagnoses could lead to harm. The aim of this review is to compare routine with selective or no scans. \\nWhy is this important? \\nIt has been assumed that routine scans before 24 weeks' gestation will result in the earlier detection of problems and improve management and the pregnancy outcome. The alternative is selective scans for specific reasons. \\nWhat evidence did we find? \\nWe searched for randomised controlled trials. We found 13 studies including 85,265 women. We included two main comparisons. \\nRoutine early scanning\\xa0 \\nUltrasound scans in the first 14 weeks reduced short‐term maternal worries about the pregnancy. There was no evidence of a clear effect on induction of labour to prevent the pregnancy going overdue, loss of the baby, early birth (before 34 weeks) or mothers choosing termination for baby abnormalities. \\nRoutine later scanning\\xa0 \\nSecond trimester scans, at 14 to 24 weeks, increased detection of baby abnormalities, and more women chose termination of pregnancy for this reason. There was no evidence of an effect on perinatal loss. Induction of labour to prevent the pregnancy going overdue was reduced. No studies reported how it affected maternal anxiety. Multiple pregnancies were more likely to be detected by 24 weeks. Long‐term follow‐up of children exposed to these scans did not indicate that they were harmful to children's physical or intellectual development. \\nWe also found one trial from a group of low and middle income countries, comparing a combination of two scans and specialist training of health professionals and referral of women with complications, with selective scans and routine care. The intervention did not alter the number of women delivering in a hospital with caesarean section facility. Nor did it appear to reduce maternal deaths or the numbers of low‐birthweight babies, although the evidence was very uncertain. \\nWe also found one trial where all women underwent scans but the results were revealed to the health care professionals in half the cases. This trial showed no important effect of revealing the scan results but the evidence was very uncertain. \\nMost studies were carried out relatively early in the development of scan technology and when training in its use was less advanced. In most trials a large proportion of women in the control groups received a scan too. \\nWhat does this mean? \\nEarly scans probably reduce maternal worries about the baby in the short term. Later scans may reduce labour induction\\xa0to prevent the pregnancy going overdue. They may also improve detection of major abnormalities in the baby and increase the number of women who choose pregnancy termination for this reason.\\xa0They may also reduce the number of undetected twin pregnancies. All these findings accord with common sense.\\xa0 \\nAlthough neither type of scan appears to alter other important outcomes, our review may underestimate the effect in modern practice because the trials were mostly\\xa0from relatively early in the development of scan technology, and many participants in the control arms\\xa0also had scans.\\xa0 \\n\", '10.1002-14651858.CD013235.pub2-pls.txt': 'Tests for identifying the most suitable antibiotics for a bacterial blood infection: are rapid tests better than standard tests? \\nWhat is the aim of this Cochrane Review? \\nPeople with blood infections need urgent treatment with antibiotics.

The standard approach is to culture the blood samples, but this takes up to 36 hours to obtain a result. Rapid tests to identify bacteria causing blood infections, and their susceptibilities to antibiotics, provide results in eight hours or less.

Curative surgery and radiotherapy are not treatment options when the disease is at an advanced stage and until recently these people were offered chemotherapy. Since 2016, immunotherapies (antibodies able to stimulate the immune system against cancer cells) have been shown to improve survival for these patients. \\nSide effects of immunotherapies are mainly inflammation of the tissues caused by the activation of the immune system against different organs, while chemotherapy usually causes a reduction in the white blood cells and red blood cells, hair loss, nausea and vomiting.In this Cochrane Review, we tried to find out how effective and safe immunotherapies (given alone or as combinations) are compared to standard chemotherapy for people with non‐small cell lung cancer who are not suitable for possibly curative treatment. \\nStudy characteristics \\nWe searched the main databases and records of conference meetings up to 31st December 2020.

We also summarized the different components of tested strategies and qualitative evidence from process evaluations. \\nBackground \\nMonitoring a clinical trial is important to ensure the safety of participants and the reliability of results. New methods have been developed for monitoring practices but further assessments of these new methods are needed to see if they do improve effectiveness without being inferior to established methods in terms of patient rights and safety, and quality assurance of trial results. We reviewed studies that examined this question within clinical trials, i.e. studies comparing different monitoring strategies used in clinical trials. \\nStudy characteristics \\nWe included eight studies which covered a variety of monitoring strategies in a wide range of clinical trials, including national and large international trials. They included primary (general), secondary (specialized), and tertiary (highly specialized) health care. The size of the studies ranged from 32 to 4371 participants at one to 196 sites. \\nKey results \\nWe identified five comparisons. The first comparison of risk‐based monitoring versus extensive on‐site monitoring found no evidence that the risk‐based approach is inferior to extensive on‐site monitoring in terms of the proportion of participants with a critical or major monitoring finding not identified by the corresponding method, while resource use was three‐ to five‐fold higher with extensive on‐site monitoring. For the second comparison of central statistical monitoring with triggered on‐site visits versus regular (untriggered) on‐site visits, we found some evidence that central statistical monitoring can identify sites in need of support by an on‐site monitoring intervention. In the third comparison, the evaluation of adding an on‐site visit to local and central monitoring revealed a high percentage of participants with major or critical monitoring findings in the on‐site visit group, but low numbers of absolute monitoring findings in both groups. This means that without on‐site visits, some monitoring findings will be missed, but none of the missed findings had any serious impact on patient safety or the validity of the trial's results. In the fourth comparison, two studies assessed new source data verification processes, which are used to check that data recorded within the trial Case Report Form (CRF) match the primary source data (e.g. medical records), and reported little difference to full source data verification processes for the targeted as well as for the remote approach. In the fifth comparison, one study showed no difference in participant recruitment and participant follow‐up between a monitoring approach with systematic initiation visits versus an approach with initiation visits upon request by study sites. \\nCertainty of evidence \\nWe are moderately certain that risk‐based monitoring is not inferior to extensive on‐site monitoring with respect to critical and major monitoring findings in clinical trials. For the remaining body of evidence, there is low or very low certainty in results due to imprecision, small number of studies, or high risk of bias. Ideally, for each of the five identified comparisons, more high‐quality monitoring studies that measure effects on all outcomes specified in this review are necessary to draw more reliable conclusions. \\n\", '10.1002-14651858.CD013298.pub2-pls.txt': \"What medicines, taken by mouth or given as an injection, work best to treat severe allergic eye disease in children and young people under 16 years old? \\nWhat is allergic eye disease? An immune response is how the body recognises and defends itself against substances that appear harmful, usually by producing specific blood proteins (antibodies) against them. An allergy is a reaction by the body's immune system to a particular substance (an allergen) that is usually harmless, such as grass or tree pollens in the air. Different allergens affect different tissues, and their effects can be mild or serious. \\nIn the eye, allergic reactions can cause conjunctivitis: the conjunctiva (the tissue covering the white of the eye and lining the inside of the eyelids) becomes swollen and sore. Severe allergic eye disease may also affect the cornea (the clear, front part of the eye), causing keratoconjunctivitis. \\nVernal keratoconjunctivitis (VKC) and atopic keratoconjunctivitis (AKC) are rare types of severe allergic eye disease. VKC usually develops in children and is more common in boys; AKC can affect children and adults. These conditions usually affect both eyes and make them red, itchy, sore, watery and sensitive to light. Both conditions can damage the cornea, which can affect eyesight and lead to blindness. Treatment is essential to save eyesight. \\nTreatments for severe allergic eye disease Both conditions are treated with medicines that try to block the allergic reaction and reduce swelling. Symptoms may get better with medicines given as eye drops, but if these don't work, other medicines may be taken by mouth or given as an injection (systemic medicines). Systemic medicines that are often used to treat severe allergic eye disease include ones that target or suppress the immune response, such as anti‑inflammatory medicines and antibodies. \\nWhy we did this Cochrane Review We wanted to find out which systemic treatments work best for severe allergic eye disease in children and young people. \\nWhat did we do?We searched for studies that looked at systemic medicines to treat severe allergic eye disease in children and young people under 16 years of age. We wanted to find studies that compared a single medicine with a placebo (dummy) medicine, or studies that compared two or more medicines against each other. \\nWe looked for randomised controlled studies, in which the treatments people received were decided at random, because these studies usually give the most reliable evidence about the effects of a treatment. \\nSearch date: We searched for evidence published up to 17 February 2020. \\nWhat we foundWe found no randomised controlled studies in children and young people with severe allergic eye disease treated by systemic medicines. \\nConclusions \\nThere is no evidence from randomised controlled studies about how well systemic medicines work for severe allergic eye disease in children and young people aged under 16 years. \\nResearch is needed to investigate how well systemic medicines work to treat severe allergic eye disease in children and young people, and to learn about any unwanted effects these medicines might cause. \\n\", '10.1002-14651858.CD013479-pls.txt': \"Comparison of different human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccines and the number of doses administered to prevent HPV‐related disease in females and males \\nHuman papillomaviruses (HPV) are a group of viruses that infect the skin and mucous membranes. Some types of HPV are sexually transmitted and are common in young people. Most infections will be cleared by the immune system, but some people will experience persistent infection with certain HPV types that go on to cause abnormalities in infected cells. These changes are called 'precancerous' because they can develop into cancers of the cervix, vagina, vulva, anal canal, penis, and head and neck. Infection with other HPV types causes warts in the genital area or around the anus. \\nVaccination aims to prevent future HPV infections. Three HPV vaccines are in use – a bivalent one (protects against two HPV types), a quadrivalent one (protects against four HPV types), and a nonavalent one (protects against nine HPV types). In women, three doses of the bivalent or the quadrivalent HPV vaccines protect against precancer of the cervix caused by the HPV types contained in the vaccine. Evidence about the nonavalent vaccine, about the effects of the quadrivalent vaccine in males, and about the effects of HPV vaccines in people with HIV infection, has not yet been reviewed thoroughly. Uptake of HPV vaccines remains low in many countries. Simpler vaccine schedules, or giving the vaccine to both girls and boys, could increase the number of people being vaccinated. \\nTrials of HPV vaccines are not always designed to collect data about precancer and cancer, for several reasons. Firstly, HPV vaccine is routinely given before girls become sexually active, and it is not ethical to take specimens from the cervix of girls who have not had sex. Secondly, HPV‐related precancer and cancer are rare and do not develop until years after HPV infection has occurred. Thirdly, participants in a trial will be offered treatment if precancer develops, so progression to cervical cancer would be even rarer, even without vaccination. An international committee of experts states that, in some circumstances, antibody levels (i.e. showing a strong immune system response), can be used to demonstrate protection against cervical and anal cancer. The antibody levels following vaccination in a trial should not be lower than those found in other studies on adults in whom the vaccine has been shown to protect against severe HPV‐related cervical or anal disease. \\nReview question(s) \\nHow effective or harmful are different HPV vaccine schedules (i.e. number and timing of doses) and different HPV vaccines in females and males? \\nMain results \\nThese results are based on research evidence to 27 September 2018. We analysed 20 studies involving 31,940 people. \\nStudies comparing two doses of HPV vaccine to three doses, or comparing the time interval between doses, focus on immune system responses rather than infection or disease outcomes. Two doses of HPV vaccine result in similar immune system responses to three doses, and a longer interval (up to 12 months) between doses gives a stronger immune system response than a shorter interval. There is insufficient evidence to determine whether there was a difference between the vaccine schedules for serious adverse events and death. \\nIn 16‐ to 26‐year‐old men, one study showed evidence of moderate certainty that a quadrivalent HPV vaccine provides better protection against external genital lesions and genital warts than a dummy treatment (control). In 16‐ to 26‐year‐old women, one study showed that the nonavalent and quadrivalent vaccines provide the same levels of protection against cervical, vaginal, and vulval precancer lesions and cancer (high‐certainty evidence). \\nThere was evidence that the quadrivalent vaccine resulted in more local adverse events (such as pain, swelling, and redness at the injection site) than a control treatment in males, and that the nonavalent vaccine resulted in more local adverse events than the quadrivalent vaccine in males and females. Evidence about serious adverse events and deaths from studies comparing different HPV vaccine types or dose schedules was of low or very low‐certainty. \\nIn people living with HIV, HPV vaccines result in reasonable levels of immune system response, but evidence about their effects on persistent HPV infection or HPV‐related disease outcomes and harms is limited. \\nCertainty of the evidence \\nNo major issues were identified with the methodological quality of the studies for the measurements of infection and disease outcomes, or for immune system responses. Our certainty in the evidence about serious harms and deaths across all the studies comparing different HPV vaccines and vaccine schedules is low, either because of their low frequency, or because the evidence is indirect, or both. Evidence graded as high certainty means that we were confident that further research is unlikely to change our findings. Moderate‐certainty evidence means that there is a possibility that further research may have an important effect on our findings, whilst low‐certainty evidence means that our confidence was limited and further research may have an important impact on our findings. Very low‐certainty evidence means that we were uncertain about the result. \\nConclusion \\nA two‐dose schedule of HPV vaccines in young females results in immune system responses that are comparable with a three‐dose schedule. In males, the quadrivalent HPV vaccine appears to be effective in the prevention of external genital lesions and genital warts. Quadrivalent and nonavalent HPV vaccines in young women result in similar levels of protection against cervical, vaginal, and vulval precancer lesions and cancer. Evidence about the efficacy and harms in people living with HIV is limited. Further long‐term population‐level studies are needed to continue monitoring safety of these vaccines, to determine for how long two doses of vaccine can provide protection against HPV‐related disease, the effect against HPV‐related cancer, and whether a two‐dose immunisation schedule will increase vaccine coverage. \\n\", '10.1002-14651858.CD013693.pub2-pls.txt': 'Screening tests for active pulmonary tuberculosis in children\\nWhy is improving screening for pulmonary tuberculosis in children important? \\nTuberculosis is one of the leading causes of death worldwide. Most children who die from tuberculosis are never diagnosed or treated. Screening may be useful to identify children with possible tuberculosis and refer them for further testing. As well, screening could be used to identify children without tuberculosis, who should be considered for preventive treatment. A false‐positive result means that children may undergo unnecessary testing and treatment and may not receive preventive treatment promptly. A false‐negative result means that children have tuberculosis, but may miss further testing to confirm the diagnosis. \\nWhat is the aim of this review? \\nTo determine the accuracy of screening tests for active pulmonary tuberculosis in children in high‐risk groups, such as children with HIV and close contacts of people with tuberculosis. \\nWhat was studied in this review? \\nScreening tests were: one tuberculosis symptom; one or more of a combination of tuberculosis symptoms; the World Health Organization (WHO) four‐symptom screen (one or more of cough, fever, poor weight gain, or tuberculosis contact) in children with HIV, recommended at each healthcare visit; chest radiography (CXR); and Xpert MTB/RIF. \\nWhat are the main results in this review? \\nNineteen studies assessed the following screening tests: one symptom (15 studies, 10,097 participants); more than one symptom (12 studies, 29,889 participants); CXR (10 studies, 7146 participants); and Xpert MTB/RIF (two studies, 787 participants). \\nSymptom screening \\nFor every 1000 children screened, if 50 had tuberculosis according to the reference standard: \\nOne or more of cough, fever, or poor weight gain in tuberculosis contacts (composite reference standard (CRS) (4 studies) \\n– 339 would screen positive, of whom 294 (87%) would not have tuberculosis (false positive). \\n– 661 would screen negative, of whom 5 (1%) would have tuberculosis (false negative).\\nOne or more of cough, fever, or decreased playfulness in children under five, inpatient or outpatient (CRS) (3 studies) \\n– 251 to 636 would screen positive, of whom 219 to 598 (87% to 94%) would not have tuberculosis (false positive). \\n– 364 to 749 would screen negative, of whom 12 to 18 (2% to 3%) would have tuberculosis (false negative). \\nOne or more of cough, fever, poor weight gain, or tuberculosis close contact (WHO four‐symptom screen) in children with HIV, outpatient (CRS) (2 studies) \\n– 88 would screen positive, of which 57 (65%) would not have tuberculosis (false positive).\\n– 912 would screen negative, of which 19 (2%) would have tuberculosis (false negative).\\nAbnormal CXR in tuberculosis contacts (CRS) (8 studies) \\n– 63 would screen positive, of whom 19 (30%) would not have tuberculosis (false positive).\\n– 937 would screen negative, of whom 6 (1%) would have tuberculosis (false negative).\\nXpert MTB/RIF in children, inpatient or outpatient microbiologic reference standard (MRS) (2 studies) \\n– 31 to 69 would be Xpert MTB/RIF‐positive, of whom 9 to 19 (28% to 29%) would not have tuberculosis (false positive). \\n– 931 to 969 would be Xpert MTB/RIF‐negative, of whom 0 to 28 (0% to 3%) would have tuberculosis (false negative). \\nHow reliable are the results of the studies in this review? \\nDiagnosing tuberculosis in children is difficult. This may lead to screening tests appearing more or less accurate than they actually are.

Studies mainly took place in countries with a high burden of tuberculosis. \\nWhat are the implications of this review? \\nIn children who are tuberculosis contacts or living with HIV, screening tests using symptoms or CXR may be useful. However, symptoms and CXR formed part of the reference standard, which may falsely elevate the accuracy of the results. We urgently need better screening tests for tuberculosis in children to better identify children who should be considered for tuberculosis preventive treatment and to increase the timeliness of treatment in those with tuberculosis disease. \\nHow up‐to‐date is this review? \\nTo 14 February 2020.\\n', '10.1002-14651858.CD013694.pub2-pls.txt': 'How accurate are sputum Xpert tests for screening for active pulmonary tuberculosis and rifampicin resistance in adults whether or not they have tuberculosis symptoms? \\nWhy is using Xpert tests to screen for pulmonary tuberculosis important? \\nTuberculosis is the leading cause of infectious disease‐related death and one of the top 10 causes of death worldwide. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends using specific rapid tests as initial tests for diagnosing tuberculosis and rifampicin resistance in people with signs and symptoms of tuberculosis. However, the WHO estimates that nearly one‐third of all active tuberculosis cases go undiagnosed and unreported. Not recognizing tuberculosis when it is present (a false negative test result) may result in illness and death and an increased risk of infecting others. An incorrect diagnosis of tuberculosis (false‐positive result) may mean that people are given antibiotics when there is no benefit to be gained. \\nWhat is the aim of this review? \\nTo estimate the accuracy of Xpert MTB/RIF and Xpert Ultra as screening tests for pulmonary tuberculosis and rifampicin resistance in adults whether or not they have tuberculosis symptoms (such as cough, fever, weight loss, and night sweats). We were interested in how the tests worked in groups at high risk for tuberculosis, including people living with HIV (PLHIV), household contacts of people with tuberculosis, miners, people residing in prisons, people with diabetes, and in the general public. \\nWhat was studied in this review? \\nXpert MTB/RIF and Xpert Ultra are rapid tests for simultaneously diagnosing tuberculosis and rifampicin resistance. We combined study results to determine: \\n‐ sensitivity: people with tuberculosis (rifampicin resistance) correctly diagnosed as having the condition. \\n‐ specificity: people without tuberculosis (rifampicin resistance) correctly identified as not having the condition. \\nThe closer sensitivity and specificity are to 100%, the better the test.\\nWhat are the main results in this review? \\nTwenty‐one studies: 18 studies (13,114 participants) evaluated Xpert MTB/RIF as a screening test for pulmonary tuberculosis and one study (571 participants) evaluated both Xpert MTB/RIF and Xpert Ultra. Three studies (159 participants) evaluated Xpert MTB/RIF for rifampicin resistance. \\nFor every 1000 people tested, if 50 had tuberculosis according to the reference standard:\\nPLHIV \\n‐ Xpert MTB/RIF (12 studies):\\n· 40 people would test positive, including 9 without tuberculosis (62% sensitivity)\\n· 960 people would test negative, including 19 with tuberculosis (99% specificity)\\n‐ Xpert Ultra (1 study):\\n· 53 people would test positive, including 19 without tuberculosis (69% sensitivity)\\n· 947 people would test negative, including 16 with tuberculosis (98% specificity)\\nFor every 1000 people tested, if 10 had tuberculosis according to the reference standard:\\nOther high‐risk groups combined \\n‐ Xpert MTB/RIF (5 studies):\\n· 19 people would test positive, including 12 without tuberculosis (69% sensitivity)\\n· 981 people would test negative, including 3 with tuberculosis (99% specificity)\\nFor detection of rifampicin resistance, Xpert MTB/RIF sensitivity was 81% and 100% (2 studies) and specificity was 94% to 100% (3 studies). \\nHow reliable are the results of the studies in this review? \\nIn the included studies, the reference standards for diagnosing pulmonary tuberculosis (culture) and rifampicin resistance (drug susceptibility testing) are likely to have been reliable methods for deciding whether patients really had the conditions. We were fairly confident in the results for Xpert MTB/RIF in PLHIV, and less so for other high‐risk groups. Not enough people have been studied to be confident about the results for Xpert Ultra or for detection of rifampicin resistance. \\nWho do the results of this review apply to? \\nStudies were mainly performed in high tuberculosis and high HIV burden settings. No studies evaluated the tests in people with diabetes mellitus or the general population. \\nWhat are the implications of this review? \\nIn PLHIV, Xpert MTB/RIF as a screening test was accurate for tuberculosis in high tuberculosis burden settings. In high‐risk groups, Xpert MTB/RIF may assist in identifying tuberculosis, but the certainty of evidence is low. In PLHIV, Xpert Ultra sensitivity was slightly higher than that of Xpert MTB/RIF and specificity similar based on one study. There were few studies and few people tested for rifampicin resistance and no studies that evaluated the tests in people with diabetes or in the general population. \\nHow up‐to‐date is this review? \\n19 March 2020.\\n', '10.1002-14651858.CD013057.pub2-abstract.txt': 'Benefits and risks of ear cleaning for people with chronic suppurative otitis media (persistent or recurring ear infection with discharge of pus) \\nWhy this is important \\nChronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM), also known as chronic otitis media (COM), is an inflammation and infection of the middle ear that lasts for two weeks or more. People with CSOM usually experience recurrent or persistent ear discharge – pus that leaks out from a hole in the eardrum – and hearing loss. \\nDifferent approaches can be used to clean the affected ears and remove discharge. These include: \\n‐ using cotton wool or tissue paper (dry mopping);‐ sucking up material blocking the ear with a small device (usually done under a microscope); or‐ washing out the ear (irrigation). \\nTo find out how effective ear cleaning is in people with CSOM, and whether it causes unwanted effects, we reviewed the evidence from research studies. In particular, we wanted to know whether ear cleaning stopped ear discharge, and whether it affected health‐related quality of life, or hearing. We also wanted to know if it caused pain, discomfort or irritation in the ear, unwanted effects such as dizziness or ear bleeding, or any serious complications. \\nHow we identified and assessed the evidence \\nFirst, we searched for all relevant studies in the medical literature. We then compared the results, and summarised the evidence from all the studies. Finally, we assessed how certain the evidence was. We considered factors such as the way studies were conducted, study sizes and consistency of findings across studies. Based on our assessments, we categorised the evidence as being of very low, low, moderate or high certainty. \\nWhat we found \\nWe found three studies in 431 people with CSOM. People were followed for between six weeks and six months after treatment. \\nThe studies compared:\\n‐ daily dry mopping versus no treatment (two studies, 351 people);‐ daily suction combined with antibiotic ear drops administered in a clinic, versus one instance of suction only (in a clinic) followed by daily self‐administered antibiotic ear drops (one study, 80 people). \\nDaily dry mopping compared against no treatment \\n‐ We do not know whether dry mopping stops ear discharge, because the evidence on whether people experienced discharge after four weeks was of very low certainty, and no studies looked at the presence of discharge earlier. \\n‐ One study reported serious complications, but it was not clear whether the people who reported complications had their ears cleaned with dry mopping or not, or whether the complications occurred before or after treatment. We therefore could not tell whether dry mopping caused serious complications, or how often these occurred. \\n‐ One study looked at hearing, but did not report the results in a way that could tell us whether or not dry mopping affects hearing. \\n‐ No studies investigated the impact of dry mopping on health‐related quality of life, ear pain, dizziness or ear bleeding. \\nDaily suction compared against one instance of suction only, in addition to antibiotic ear drops \\n‐ We do not know whether suction stops ear discharge, because the evidence for between one and two weeks after treatment was of very low certainty, and the results for discharge after four weeks could not be interpreted. \\n‐ We do not know if suction affects hearing or dizziness, as the evidence was of very low certainty. \\n‐ No studies investigated the impact of suction on health‐related quality of life, ear pain, serious complications or ear bleeding. \\nWhat this means \\nWe do not know how effective ear cleaning is for people with CSOM, and whether it causes unwanted effects. There are very few studies in this area, and these provide very low‐certainty evidence. Unwanted effects were not well reported in the studies we found. We need researchers to conduct future studies that compare ear cleaning to no cleaning, and compare different cleaning techniques and frequency, so that we can assess the benefits and risks of ear cleaning for people with CSOM. \\nHow‐up‐to date is this review? \\nThe evidence in this Cochrane Review is current to March 2020.\\n', '10.1002-14651858.CD014257.pub2-pls.txt': \"Probiotics for treatment of chronic constipation in children\\nWhat is the aim of this review? \\nThe aim of this Cochrane Review was to find out whether probiotics can be used to treat chronic constipation without a physical explanation in children (aged 0 to 18 years). \\nWe analysed data from 14 studies to answer this question.\\nKey messages \\nWe were unable to draw conclusions when comparing probiotics to placebo for frequency of defecation in children treated for chronic constipation\\xa0without a physical explanation. There may be no difference in treatment success between the two groups. \\nThere may not be a difference in frequency of defecation or treatment success when comparing probiotics and laxatives to using laxatives alone. \\nWe were unable to draw conclusions when comparing probiotics to magnesium oxide for frequency of defecation or treatment success. \\nThere may be a higher frequency of defecation in children treated with synbiotic preparations compared to placebo. \\nThere may not be a difference in participants withdrawing from the studies due to adverse events when comparing probiotic preparations to placebo. \\nWe were unable to draw conclusions on the safety of any of the other comparisons due to the low number of people who withdrew from the studies. \\nWhat was studied in the review? \\nChildren often suffer from constipation for long periods of time, and when there is no underlying physical cause that can be found we call it 'functional constipation'. \\nIt has been suggested that probiotic and synbiotic preparations might help improve symptoms in these children. Probiotics are preparations that contain living bacteria that have been proposed to be beneficial to the digestive system. Synbiotics also include food substances that support the growth of these bacteria. \\nThere is currently no consensus about whether this is the case, or how these preparations are best used. \\nWhat are the main results of the review? \\nWe searched for randomised controlled trials (studies in which participants are assigned to one of two or more treatment groups using a random method) comparing any probiotic or synbiotic treatment with any other treatment (such as dummy/placebo treatments) in children with chronic constipation without a physical explanation. We found 14 trials including a total of 1127 participants who were aged under 18. We made the following conclusions.• There may be no difference in treatment success when comparing probiotics to placebo.• We were unable to draw conclusions on whether there is a difference in the frequency of defecation.• There may be no difference in treatment success when comparing probiotics and laxatives to laxatives alone.• We were unable to draw conclusions on frequency of defecation or treatment success when comparing probiotics to magnesium oxide.• Synbiotics may be better than placebo in improving the frequency of defection.• There may be no difference in how many people withdrew from the trials because of side effects when comparing probiotics to placebo, or probiotics and laxative to laxative alone.• We have limited confidence in the evidence because the studies only included a small number of children, and due to lack of detail on some of the methods used. \\nAll analyses were limited due to differences in the specific probiotics or the treatments they were compared with, low numbers of children included in the studies and, most importantly, the use of a range of different measures of success. This meant that combining studies was difficult, so the overall ability of this review to answer its core questions was limited. \\nWhat next? \\nFuture studies are needed to find out how helpful probiotics are for childhood constipation. Researchers need to agree whether probiotics should be a first option therapy, an add‐on to other therapies, a second option after other therapies have failed, or a combination of all the above. \\nFuture research should measure the same items (known as a core outcome set) to ensure these results can support future reviews. \\nHow up‐to‐date is this review? \\nThis review is current to June 2021.\\n\", '10.1002-14651858.CD012080.pub2-abstract.txt': 'Accuracy of different non‐invasive methods for identifying Helicobacter pylori \\nWhy is it important to know whether someone has Helicobacter pylori? \\nHelicobacter pylori (H pylori) is a type of bacteria which may be present in the stomach of some people. H pylori is believed to cause a number of cancers, including stomach cancer, pancreatic cancer, and throat cancer. H pylori is also linked with other diseases including stomach ulcers, heart burn, and a bloated feeling. If H pylori is found in an individual, appropriate treatment can be started. \\nWhat is the aim of this review? \\nTo compare the accuracy of three different types of test for H pylori. These are: urea breath tests, blood tests (the specific blood test is called serology), and stool tests (in faeces). \\nWhat was studied in this review? \\nThere are two types of urea breath test which use two different forms of carbon known as 13C and 14C, as well as multiple versions of serology and stool tests. \\nWhat are the main results of the review? \\nWe found 101 studies which included 11,003 people who were tested for H pylori. Of these 11,003 participants, 5839 (53.1%) had H pylori infection. All the studies used one of the three tests listed above and compared these test results with the diagnosis given by endoscopic biopsy. Endoscopic biopsy involves obtaining tissue from the stomach using a thin flexible tube introduced through the mouth and testing for the presence of H pylori under the microscope. It is currently the most accurate available test, however it causes physical discomfort to the patient, with associated risks for harm. This is in contrast to the alternative non‐invasive tests in this review which are significantly less uncomfortable and have minimal or no risk of harm, making them desirable alternatives if they can be shown to be as accurate at diagnosing H pylori as endoscopic biopsy. Most of the studies included participants with heart burn or similar problems in the stomach and excluded participants who had previously undergone partial removal of the stomach and those having treatment for H pylori. \\nThirty‐four studies (4242 participants) used serology; 29 studies (2988 participants) used stool antigen test; 34 studies (3139 participants) used urea breath test‐13C; 21 studies (1810 participants) used urea breath test‐14C; and two studies (127 participants) used urea breath test but did not report the type of carbon used. Studies varied in the limit they used before saying a test was positive for H pylori infection and the type of stains used to examine the biopsy material. When we looked at all the data we found that urea breath tests were more accurate than blood and stool tests. The results mean that, on average, if 1000 people are tested, there will be 46 people without H pylori who will be misdiagnosed as having H pylori. Also, there will be 30, 42, 86, and 89 people with H pylori infection for whom the diagnosis of H pylori infection will be missed by urea breath test‐13C, urea breath test‐14C, serology, and stool antigen test, respectively. When we looked at the seven studies which compared urea breath test‐13C and serology, or urea breath test‐13C and stool antigen tests in the same participants, the results were uncertain and we cannot tell which test is more accurate. \\nHow reliable are the results of the studies? \\nExcept for one study, all the studies were of poor methodological quality, which makes their results unreliable. \\nWho do the results of this review apply to? \\nThese results apply to children and adults with suspected H pylori infection, but only in those who have not previously undergone stomach operations and those who have not recently had antibiotics or treatment for H pylori infection. \\nWhat are the implications of this review? \\nUrea breath tests, blood tests, and stool tests may be suitable for identifying whether someone has H pylori infection. However, the level of the result of urea breath test, blood test, or stool test which should be used to make a diagnosis of H pylori infection remains unclear. \\nHow up‐to‐date is the review? \\nWe performed a thorough literature search for studies reporting the accuracy of these different tests until 4 March 2016. \\n', '10.1002-14651858.CD013446-pls.txt': 'Regimens of vitamin D supplementation for women during pregnancy\\nWhat is the issue? \\nThis review evaluated if there are beneficial effects of supplementing pregnant women with more than the current vitamin D recommendation (200 international units/day (IU/d) to 600 IU/d) on pregnancy and neonatal health outcomes and to evaluate if there are negative health effects when using more than the current upper limit recommendation (4000 IU/d). \\nWhy is this important? \\nVitamin D supplementation in pregnancy compared to no supplementation appears to decrease the risk of pre‐eclampsia, gestational diabetes, low birthweight and may reduce the risk of severe postpartum haemorrhage. However, it is not clear if doses greater than the currently recommended level are needed to observe these health benefits, and if giving more than the upper limit is related to adverse events. \\nWhat was studied in the review? \\nThis review included trials evaluating the effect of different vitamin D regimens (doses, frequencies, duration, and times of commencement) to compare the effects of 601 IU/d or more versus 600 IU/d or less and 4000 IU/d or more versus 3999 IU/d or less, of vitamin D alone or with any other nutrient on pregnancy and neonatal health outcomes. \\nWhat evidence did we find? \\nEvidence from 19 trials involving 5214 women suggest that supplementation with 601 IU/d or more of vitamin D during pregnancy may reduce the risk of gestational diabetes but may make little or no difference to the risk of pre‐eclampsia, preterm birth or low birthweight compared to women receiving 600 IU/d or less. \\nEvidence from 15 trials involving 4763 women suggests that supplementation with 4000 IU/d or more of vitamin D during pregnancy may make little or no difference to the risk of pre‐eclampsia, gestational diabetes, preterm birth or low birthweight compared to women receiving 3999 IU/d or less. \\nAdverse events were reported differently in most trials; in general, there was little to no side effects reported or similar cases between groups. \\nWhat does this mean? \\nSupplementing pregnant women with more than the current vitamin D recommendation may reduce the risk of gestational diabetes; however, it may make little or no difference in the risk of the other outcomes. Supplementing pregnant women with more than the current upper limit for vitamin D seems not to increase the risk of the outcomes evaluated.

A person with depression may feel tearful, irritable, or tired most of the time, and may have problems with sleep, concentration, and memory. These and other symptoms can make daily life more difficult than usual. \\nTreatments for depression include medications (antidepressants) and psychological therapies (talking therapies). Behavioural activation is a type of psychological therapy that encourages a person to develop or get back into activities which are meaningful to them. The therapy involved scheduling activities and monitoring behaviours and looking at specific situations where changing these behaviours and activities may be helpful. A therapist may support people in person, over the phone, or online, usually over multiple sessions. \\nIt is important to know whether behavioural activation could be an effective and acceptable treatment to offer to people with depression. \\nWhat we did \\nIn January 2020, we searched for studies of behavioural activation therapy for depression in adults (aged over 18 years). We looked for randomised controlled trials, in which treatments were given to study participants at random; these studies give the most reliable evidence. \\nWe included 53 studies involving 5495 participants. The studies compared behavioural activation with no treatment, standard or usual care, a dummy treatment (placebo), taking medications, being on a waiting list for treatment, or other psychotherapies (cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), third‐wave CBT, humanistic therapy, psychodynamic therapy, and integrative therapy). \\nThe studies were conducted in 14 countries; most were conducted in the USA (27 studies). Most studies lasted from four to 16 weeks. \\nThe outcomes we focussed on were how well the treatments worked and whether they were acceptable to participants. How well treatments worked (efficacy) was measured by the number of people who responded well to treatment or no longer met criteria for depression at the end of treatment. Acceptability was measured by counting how many people dropped out during the study. \\nWhat did we find? \\nBehavioural activation may treat depression better than receiving usual care. We were uncertain whether behavioural activation worked better than medication or being on a waiting list, and we found no evidence for this outcome comparing behavioural activation to no treatment or placebo treatment. \\nWe found no differences between behavioural activation and CBT in treating depression. Although we did not find enough evidence to compare behavioural activation reliably with other psychotherapies, it may work better than humanistic therapy, and we found no differences between behavioural activation and third‐wave CBT or psychodynamic therapy. No evidence was available comparing behavioural activation to integrative therapies. \\nBehavioural activation is probably less acceptable to people than usual care. We found no differences in acceptability of behavioural activation compared with being on a waiting list, no treatment, taking antidepressants, or receiving a placebo treatment. We also found no differences in acceptability between behavioural activation and other psychotherapies studied (CBT, third‐wave CBT, humanistic therapy, integrative therapies). For behavioural activation compared with psychodynamic therapy, we found no evidence on treatment acceptability. \\nConclusions \\nBehavioural activation may be an effective and acceptable treatment for depression in adults. Offering this therapy in practice would give people with depression greater treatment choice, and different formats and types of delivery could be explored to meet the demand for mental health support. Our confidence in these findings is limited due to concerns about the certainty of the evidence. \\nMost findings were short‐term, meaning that we cannot be sure behavioural activation would be helpful to people with depression in the longer term. \\nCertainty of the evidence \\nOur certainty (confidence) in the evidence is mostly low to moderate. Some findings are based on only a few studies, with poorly reported results, in which the participants knew which treatment they received. Therefore, we are not sure how reliable the results are. Our conclusions may change if more studies are conducted. \\n', '10.1002-14651858.CD013398.pub3-pls.txt': 'House modifications for preventing malaria\\nWhat is the aim of this review? \\nHouse modifications, such as screening (covering potential house entry points for mosquitoes with netting or mesh), or the use of alternative construction materials, may contribute to reducing the burden of malaria.

No studies reported useful results for the person's own assessment of their scar after treatment. \\nNo studies reported useful results for people's well‐being (quality of life): for whether people stayed on the treatment (adherence), whether the treatments had any unwanted effects; or whether the treatments were cost‐effective (the benefits of treatment outweighed any extra costs). \\nThe studies did not give enough information to compare silicone gel sheets with steroid injections, laser therapy or pulsed light. \\nWhat are the main results of our review? \\nSilicone gel sheets may slightly improve the appearance of hypertrophic scars compared with onion extract. \\xa0We are uncertain whether silicone gel sheets improve a scar's appearance better than no treatment with silicone gel sheets, or silicone gel, or polyurethane.\\xa0 \\nSilicone gel sheets may reduce pain levels compared with pressure garments. Silicone gel sheets may also result in a slight reduction in pain levels compared with no treatment with silicone gel sheets. We are uncertain whether silicone gel sheets decrease pain compared with self‐adhesive propylene glycol and hydroxyethyl cellulose sheeting. \\xa0The evidence is also very uncertain about the effect of silicone gel sheets on pain compared with Gecko Nanoplast. \\nCertainty of the evidence \\nOur certainty (confidence) in the evidence was low, or very low. The evidence we found comes from a few studies (sometimes only one), often in small numbers of people, with poorly reported results, so we are not sure how reliable the results are. We therefore think our conclusions would be likely to change if results from further studies become available. \\nConclusions \\nWe are uncertain about whether silicone gel sheets work better than most other treatments for hypertrophic scars. Silicone gel sheets may improve the appearance of scars slightly compared with applying onion extract, and may reduce pain compared with no treatment with silicone gel sheets or pressure garments. \\nSearch date \\nThis review includes evidence published up to 21 April 2021.\\n\", '10.1002-14651858.CD011345.pub2-abstract.txt': \"Timed intercourse for couples with subfertility\\nReview question \\nResearchers in The Cochrane Collaboration reviewed the evidence about the effect of timed intercourse versus spontaneous intercourse in couples trying to conceive. \\nBackground \\nMany couples find it difficult to achieve a pregnancy and have concerns about their fertility. Each cycle, a woman is fertile from approximately five days before ovulation until several hours after ovulation, due to limited survival times of the sperm and egg. Therefore, prospectively identifying this fertile period of a woman's menstrual cycle, to guide timing of intercourse, may improve conception rates. This may reduce unnecessary medical treatment and costs of advanced infertility treatment, but could also cause adverse events such as stress. The fertile period can be identified by different methods including urinary fertility monitoring, calendar charting, observing changes in cervical mucous and basal body temperatures or follicular maturation on ultrasound. The aim of this review was to assess the benefits and risks of timed intercourse on pregnancy outcomes in couples trying to conceive. \\nStudy characteristics \\nWe found five randomised controlled trials comparing timed intercourse versus intercourse without ovulation prediction, in a total of 2840 women or couples trying to conceive. The evidence was current to August 2014. \\nKey results \\nOne large included study (1453 women) has not published usable results and could therefore not be analysed. One study reported live birth rates and found no evidence of a difference; however, the study was too small to have any clinical value. Only one study reported levels of stress and showed no evidence of a difference between timed intercourse with urinary fertility monitoring and intercourse without urinary fertility monitoring. No other adverse events were reported. Only two studies reported clinical pregnancy rates, and showed no evidence of a difference in pregnancy rates in couples with subfertility. The evidence suggested that if the chance of a clinical pregnancy following intercourse without ovulation prediction was assumed to be 16%, the chance of a clinical pregnancy following timed intercourse would be between 9% and 33%. However, if including self‐reported pregnancies (not confirmed by ultrasound), pregnancy rates were higher after timed intercourse. The evidence suggested that if the chance of a pregnancy following intercourse without ovulation prediction was 13%, the chance following timed intercourse would be between 14% and 23%. \\nNo difference in effect was found between couples trying to conceive for less than 12 months versus 12 months or more. One trial reported time to conception data and showed no evidence of a difference in time to conception. \\nQuality of the evidence \\nThe overall quality of the evidence ranged from low to very low for all outcomes. The main limitations of the evidence were imprecision, poor reporting of clinically relevant outcomes and a high risk of publication bias, as one large study remains unpublished. Therefore, the findings should be regarded with caution. \\n\", '10.1002-14651858.CD004019.pub4-abstract.txt': \"Osteotomy for treating knee osteoarthritis\\nResearchers from The Cochrane Collaboration conducted a review of the effects of an osteotomy in people with osteoarthritis of the knee. Upon searching for all relevant studies until November 2013, they found 21 studies that included up to 1065 people. Their findings are summarised below. \\nThis review shows that in people with osteoarthritis of the knee:\\n• osteotomy can improve pain and function, but this is based on changes within a treatment group. No studies compared osteotomy versus conservative treatment; and • no evidence can be found for a preferred osteotomy technique. \\nWhat is osteoarthritis of the knee, and what is an osteotomy?  Osteoarthritis (OA) is a disease of the joints, such as the knee or the hip. When the joint loses cartilage, the bone grows to try to repair the damage. Instead of making things better, however, the bone grows abnormally and makes things worse. For example, the bone can become misshapen, and this can make the joint painful and unstable. This can affect physical function or ability to use the knee. Two main types of surgery are used to treat patients with osteoarthritis of the knee: knee replacement and osteotomy. \\nOsteotomy is surgery in which the bones are cut and realigned. Osteotomy around the knee changes the alignment of the knee. Weight bearing will be shifted from the diseased part to a healthy part of the knee. By 'unloading' the damaged cartilage of the knee, osteotomy may decrease pain, improve function, slow knee deterioration and possibly delay the need for (partial or) total knee replacement surgery. \\nWhat happens to people after an osteotomy for knee osteoarthritis?  Follow‐up of all studies was too short to allow scoring of treatment failure; this refers to a revision to a knee replacement. \\nIn all studies, people reported less pain and improved knee function and quality of life after any type of high tibial osteotomy. However this comparison is based on differences before and after an osteotomy, not on comparison with non‐operative treatment. Probably no differences in pain and function scores are noted between different osteotomy techniques. \\nRare complications may include thromboembolism and lesions to nerves and vascular structures. \\nThe most important reasons for reoperation include hardware removal resulting from pain and pin track infection due to the external fixator. This reoperation rate may be higher in patients undergoing another high tibial osteotomy technique compared with those treated with the closing wedge technique. \\nTwo studies compared high tibial osteotomy versus partial knee replacement. Benefits did not differ between these types of surgery. \\n\", '10.1002-14651858.CD013181.pub2-pls.txt': 'Self‐administered versus provider‐administered medical abortion (review)\\nReview question \\nThe aim of this review was to compare whether women taking abortion drugs on their own without healthcare provider supervision can do so as successfully and safely as women who take the drugs in the presence of trained healthcare providers. \\nBackground \\nMedical abortion used to end pregnancies has been successful and safe when women have access to appropriate information and resources. In provider‐administered medical abortion, drugs are taken in the presence of trained healthcare providers. Access to medical abortion drugs has increased and has given women more control over their abortion procedures through self‐administration. In self‐administered medical abortion, the woman takes the drug(s) without the supervision of a healthcare provider after receiving appropriate information and resources. This is the first review of the published evidence on whether self‐administration of medical abortion is a safe and successful way to end pregnancies. We compared the success and safety\\xa0of self‐administered medical abortion versus provider‐administered medical abortion. \\nStudy characteristics \\nWe included 18 studies (two randomized controlled trials and 16 prospective cohort studies)\\xa0covering 11,043 women undergoing early medical abortion\\xa0(up to nine weeks gestation) in 10 countries that compared self‐administered medical abortion to provider‐administered medical abortion,\\xa0after an initial clinic visit. Most studies (16) were conducted in low‐to‐middle resource settings and two studies in high‐resource settings. The evidence described in this review is from studies published before 10 July 2019. \\nKey results \\nWomen who self‐administer medical abortion drugs in early pregnancy (up to nine weeks gestational age) experience similar rates of completed abortion as women who undergo provider‐administered procedures in low‐to‐middle and high‐resource settings. Evidence about safety is uncertain. \\nQuality of the evidence \\nThe evidence for the success of self‐administered medical abortion compared to provider‐administered medical abortion was of moderate certainty, due to low‐certainty studies. The evidence for the safety of these interventions was very low, due to low‐certainty studies.\\xa0 \\n', '10.1002-14651858.CD011716.pub2-abstract.txt': 'Use of oxygen during activities for people with lung scarring conditions\\nReview question \\nShould oxygen be used for people with lung scarring conditions, known as interstitial lung disease (ILD), whose oxygen levels drop when they exercise? \\nBackground \\nMany people with ILD have a drop in their oxygen levels when they are moving about. This is because of their lung scarring. Oxygen can be given, to be used only when people are moving about, to prevent this drop. This is called ambulatory oxygen. This may help to improve symptoms of breathlessness and their ability to exercise. It may also improve their quality of life. This Cochrane review examined the evidence for any effect of ambulatory oxygen on the ability to exercise, breathlessness and quality of life. Cochrane researchers searched the available evidence up to 4th May 2016. \\nStudy characteristics and key results \\nWe included only three studies, which had a total of 98 participants with ILD. All three studies compared the effects of both oxygen and air in all participants while they did an exercise test, while preventing them from knowing which treatment they were being given. Two studies showed no helpful effects on the ability to exercise or on symptoms of breathlessness. One study showed that participants could exercise for longer with oxygen. None of these studies looked at the effect of oxygen on quality of life, survival, the cost of oxygen treatment or its effects on hospital admissions. No adverse events were reported in any of the studies. \\nWe also looked for studies of oxygen given after exercise in people with ILD (\"short burst oxygen\"), but did not find any studies. \\nQuality of the evidence \\nThere were some problems with the way these studies were conducted. The included studies were small. Also, two studies did not make sure that the amount of oxygen given was enough to prevent a drop in oxygen levels when the participants were exercising. This could mean that they were not given enough oxygen. The overall quality of evidence in this review was low. \\nConclusions \\nWe cannot tell from these studies if ambulatory oxygen is helpful in people with ILD. More research is needed, which should look at the effect of ambulatory oxygen on exercise, breathlessness and also on quality of life in people with ILD. \\n', '10.1002-14651858.CD013243.pub2-pls.txt': 'Animal‐assisted therapy for people with dementia\\nReview question \\nDo therapy sessions that involve live animals help people with dementia?\\nBackground \\nDementia is an increasingly common condition across the world. People with dementia have progressive loss of the ability to think, remember, and communicate; to manage their daily activities; and to mix successfully with other people. Many people with dementia also develop depression and related problems. To date, no treatment has proven able to cure the disease or stop it from getting worse. However, many treatments are in use which aim to improve the well‐being of people with dementia and the people who look after them. Animal‐assisted therapy (AAT) is one of the types of treatment that has been studied. It is thought that animals could help people with dementia by providing companionship and support in daily activities and that this might lead to improvements in physical and mental health, including better mood and fewer problematic behaviours. \\nSearch date \\nWe searched medical databases to September 2019.\\nKey characteristics of included studies \\nWe included nine randomised controlled trials (clinical studies where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups), involving 305 people with dementia, which compared AAT to a control treatment (either usual care or an alternative treatment). All studies took place in Europe or the US. Seven studies compared AAT to usual care or to another activity which had nothing to do with animals. Two studies compared AAT (using live animals) to the use of robotic animals. One study compared AAT to the use of a soft toy cat. There were some features of the studies which could have biased the results. Study participants and care staff knew what treatment a person was receiving and this might have affected some results. Also, it was not always clear that the randomisation to treatments had been done as well as possible. \\nFunding sources \\nThe studies received funding from various sources, including research grants (four studies), personal donation (one study), and support from an institute that promotes AAT (two studies). Two studies did not describe how they were funded. \\nKey results \\nWe found evidence from two studies with 83 participants that people with dementia who had AAT were possibly slightly less depressed at the end of treatment than people who had standard care or other interventions not related to animals. We also found evidence from three studies with 164 participants that people who received AAT had no clear difference in their quality of life compared to those who did not. However, we found no evidence of an effect on social functioning (interactions with their environment and families), behaviour, agitation, activities of daily living, self‐care ability or balance. There were no clear differences when AAT was compared with the use of a robotic animal in two studies with 156 participants (in social functioning, behaviour, and quality of life), or with the use of a soft toy cat in one study with 64 participants (in social functioning). There were no data on harmful effects of the treatment on the participants and nothing was reported about the effect on the animals in any study. \\nCertainty of the evidence \\nWe took several factors into account when deciding how certain we could be of our results. In this review, two main factors reduced our level of certainty. First, for all the outcomes we looked at, there was only a small number of studies and participants. Second, we thought there was a significant risk that all of the results could have been biased by the way the studies were designed or conducted. For a few outcomes, our confidence was also reduced by inconsistent results between studies. Overall, our certainty about the results ranged from very low to moderate. \\nConclusions \\nAAT may slightly reduce depressive symptoms. Otherwise, no conclusions can yet be drawn on whether AAT is beneficial or safe for people with dementia. The small size of the included studies, and the diversity of outcomes and outcome measures, were major issues. We recommend further well‐conducted studies with the inclusion of important outcomes such as emotional and social well‐being, quality of life, side effects, and effects on the animals. \\n', '10.1002-14651858.CD014201-pls.txt': \"Regular clotting factor replacement therapy to prevent joint damage in people living with severe hemophilia A or B \\nReview question \\nShould people, who have previously been treated for joint bleeding, be given regular preventative treatment with clotting factor concentrates to manage their condition? \\nBackground \\nHemophilia A and B are X‐linked inherited bleeding disorders in which bleeding \\xa0into joints is a major problem. Repeated joint bleeds can lead to affected joints (commonly referred to as 'target joints') becoming damaged and painful, with limited movement. Currently, bleeding is\\xa0treated and prevented with plasma‐derived or recombinant clotting factor concentrates, and more recently non‐clotting factor formulations. This review looked at how useful and effective different clotting factor treatment strategies are for preventing joint bleeding and other outcomes in previously treated people with hemophilia A or B. \\nSearch date \\nDate of last search: 24 February 2021.\\nStudy characteristics \\nThis review includes 10 randomised controlled trials. Eight had treatment arms that compared the regular use of clotting factor concentrates to prevent joint bleeds with different dosing schemes to identify regimens that may be better; four had treatment arms that compared the regular use of factor concentrates to prevent bleeds to their 'on demand' use to treat bleeds once they occur (two trials had multiple arms and were included in both comparisons). \\nKey results \\nIn people\\xa0living with hemophilia A or B previously treated for joint bleeding or with existing joint damage, preventive therapy may reduce the number of joint bleeds compared to 'on‐demand therapy'. This reduction in bleeds may lead to an improvement in joint function, pain, and quality of life. However, preventive therapy is linked to an increased use of factor concentrates and therefore higher treatment costs. Further studies are needed to establish the best preventive course of treatment in terms of starting time, frequency and dose level. \\nCertainty of the evidence \\nOverall, the certainty of the evidence was judged to be low because of different types of bias that could have affected the results. Future research might have an important role in changing our confidence in these results. \\n\", '10.1002-14651858.CD007492.pub2-abstract.txt': \"Healthcare services for adults with an intellectual disability\\nBackground \\nAdults with an intellectual disability often have difficulty in receiving the healthcare they need. Compared to other adults who do not have an intellectual disability, they have poorer health and have more difficulty finding, getting to, and paying for healthcare. This happens for both physical and mental healthcare needs. \\nReview question \\nWe conducted a review of the literature to assess the effects of different ways to organise services. This is the first update of a previously published review. \\nStudy characteristics \\nWe searched for all relevant studies until 4 September 2015. We found seven studies, six of which we identified previously and one retrieved for this update. All of the studies assessed the impact of the intervention on the mental health of persons with an intellectual disability; none considered the physical health.\\xa0Those studies used different interventions, including giving persons with an intellectual disability more health services, psychological support, and treating them at home, instead of at the hospital. Studies mainly looked at how the interventions helped the behavioural problems of those with an intellectual disability, how much burden they caused the care givers, and how much they cost. No study assessed adverse events. \\nKey results \\nCommunity‐based behaviour therapy might decrease behavioural problems. We are uncertain whether other interventions make any difference in reducing behavioural problems. There was limited evidence about how those interventions helped care givers to deal with the burden of caring for their relatives with an intellectual disability, or how much they might cost compared with the usual care already provided. \\nAuthors' conclusions \\nThere is little information on different ways to organise services for people with intellectual disabilities. Most studies focused on people who had intellectual disabilities and mental health problems.\\xa0There were no studies on people who had intellectual disabilities and physical problems. \\n\", '10.1002-14651858.CD006171.pub4-abstract.txt': \"Prenatal education for congenital toxoplasmosis\\nToxoplasmosis infection is caused by a parasite, Toxoplasma gondii. Eating or handling raw or insufficiently‐cooked meat, not washing hands thoroughly after gardening, handling contaminated soil or water, or contact with cats' faeces can cause infection. Usually it is asymptomatic and self‐limiting. Primary prevention involves educating the general public, filtering water and improving farm hygiene to reduce animal infection. \\nIf pregnant women have not previously been exposed to the parasite and develop antibodies while pregnant, the infection can be transmitted from the mother to the fetus (congenital toxoplasmosis). This is rare but potentially has serious consequences such as malformation, mental retardation, deafness and blindness of the infected infant, intrauterine death or stillbirth. The probability of infection is greater during the third trimester but the risk of the fetus developing major clinical signs is greater early in pregnancy. Pregnant women are often unaware of risk factors for congenital toxoplasmosis. Offering prenatal education could mean that women adopt simple behavioral measures to avoid toxoplasmosis. \\nThis review included two randomized controlled trials (involving 5455 women). Data could not be combined because each trial measured effectiveness in different ways. One study was from Canada and involved 432 women randomly assigned to a 10‐minute presentation during a prenatal class about toxoplasmosis prevention or to a usual prenatal class. Losses to follow‐up were high and 285 completed the post‐test questionnaire in the third trimester. Only 5% of the intervention women recalled having obtained information on toxoplasmosis prevention during prenatal classes. However, the authors concluded that prenatal education can effectively change pregnant women's behavior as it increased pet, personal and food hygiene. The other trial conducted in France involved 5023 pregnant women with no evidence of toxoplasmosis infection (seronegative) who were randomly assigned to receive a brochure and an audiotape containing information for toxoplasmosis prevention, or to a usual prenatal class. Losses to follow‐up were high and 2790 completed both pre‐test and post‐test questionnaire on behavior (44.5% loss to follow‐up), whereas 3949 women were tested for blood antibodies (22.4% loss to follow‐up). Women's behavior did not change after the intervention. Similarly, the seroconversion rate did not differ between groups (13 out of 2591 women seroconverted in the intervention and four out of 1358 in the control group). \\nBoth trials were judged as having low methodological quality as assessed by the GRADE approach. This limits our confidence in the results. Evidence supporting prenatal education to prevent congenital toxoplasmosis is therefore limited. \\n\", '10.1002-14651858.CD013333.pub2-pls.txt': 'Tea tree oil for Demodex blepharitis\\nWhat was the aim of this review?To examine the effects of tea tree oil, an essential oil derived from an Australian tree, which can be applied in many different forms (eyelid wipes, eyelid shampoo, oil massages, etc.) on Demodex blepharitis. Demodex blepharitis is an inflammation of the eyelid caused by Demodex mites (frequently referred to as eyelash mites). \\nKey messagesWe are uncertain if tea tree oil is better compared to other treatments. Other factors such as dosage, ocular hygiene, and patient compliance likely affect treatment outcomes; however, more and better‐designed studies are needed to confirm these findings. \\nWhat did we study in this review?Blepharitis causes symptoms such as eye itching, burning, dryness, irritation, watering, or blurry vision, which lead people to seek medical attention. This study aimed to understand the ability of tea tree oil to improve symptoms or to treat Demodex blepharitis (or both) in comparison to no treatment or other forms of treatment containing no tea tree oil. \\nWhat were the main results of this review?This review included six studies with 562 participants (1124 eyes). They were men and women between the ages of 39 and 55 years. The included studies were conducted in the US, Korea, China, Australia, Ireland, and Turkey. Trial designs greatly varied, which limited analyses and the confidence in the results. Most studies included in this report had a high degree of bias. It is uncertain if tea tree oil (concentration ranging from 5% to 50%) is helpful for reducing the number of Demodex mites in people with Demodex blepharitis in short‐term cases. While not fully addressed in the reviewed literature, people should be educated on how to properly apply tea tree oil products because patient compliance and method of application likely affects efficacy.

They are also recommended for people with unstable angina or heart disease, or people who have had a heart attack, heart surgery or a stroke. Taking antiplatelet therapy introduces an increased risk of bleeding, which could lead to problems if a person needs non‐cardiac surgery. Stopping usual antiplatelet therapy a few days before surgery might reduce the risk of serious bleeding during surgery. Not taking these antiplatelet drugs could, however, increase the risk of a heart attack, stroke, or death. \\nStudy characteristics \\nThe evidence from randomized controlled trials is current to January 2018. We included five trials with 666 adults in the review. Three studies are ongoing. All participants were taking antiplatelet therapy (aspirin or clopidogrel) at the start of the study. Two studies stopped antiplatelet drugs for at least five days before surgery, and three studies gave participants a placebo instead of antiplatelet therapy during this time. \\nKey results \\nWe found low‐certainty evidence that either continuing or stopping antiplatelet therapy may make little or no difference to the number of people who died up to 30 days or six months after surgery (five studies, 659 participants). We found moderate‐certainty evidence that either continuing or stopping antiplatelet therapy probably makes little or no difference to incidences of bleeding serious enough to need a blood transfusion during or immediately after surgery (four studies, 368 participants). We found low‐certainty evidence that either continuing or stopping antiplatelet therapy may make little or no difference to bleeding serious enough to need further surgery (four studies, 368 participants), and may make little or no difference to the number of ischaemic events such as stroke or heart attack (four studies, 616 participants). \\nQuality of the evidence \\nSome studies had low risk of bias because they had clearly reported their methods for randomizing people to each group, and three studies used a placebo agent so that people did not know whether or not they were continuing their usual antiplatelet therapy. However, we found few studies with few events, with wide variation in results. To continue or stop taking antiplatelet drugs for a few days before non‐cardiac surgery might make little or no difference to the number of people who died, who had bleeding that needed further surgery or who had ischaemic events, and it probably makes little or no difference to bleeding that needed a blood transfusion.

We looked at the number of women who went on to have a live birth, or miscarriage. \\nWhat is the issue? \\nMiscarriage is the most common cause of early pregnancy loss in the first 24 weeks and one of the most common complications in early pregnancy. An estimated 15% to 20% of pregnancies will end in a miscarriage, with 25% of women experiencing a miscarriage in their lifetime. Women can be at risk of a miscarriage if they experience early pregnancy bleeding, or if they have a history of previous miscarriages. \\nWhy is this important? \\nProgesterone is an important pregnancy hormone that helps to maintain a pregnancy. A variety of different progesterone‐like treatments (known as progestogens) have been used to treat women with early pregnancy bleeding. They are also used to prevent miscarriage in women with a history of previous miscarriages. There is uncertainty about the effectiveness, safety, and side‐effects of the available progestogens for preventing miscarriage in these different groups of women. We wanted to find out which, if any, of the treatments is the most effective and safest.

Four different progestogen treatments were used: vaginal micronized progesterone, oral dydrogesterone, oral micronized progesterone and 17‐α‐hydroxyprogesterone injected into muscle. In six of the studies the treatments were compared to inactive placebo. \\nThree studies involved 4496 women with threatened miscarriage, some of whom had previously experienced a miscarriage. Overall, vaginal micronized progesterone (high‐quality evidence) and oral dydrogesterone (moderate‐quality evidence) made little difference to the number of women who went on to have a live birth when compared with placebo. We further studied the women who had experienced a previous miscarriage, were now presenting with a threatened miscarriage, and were given vaginal micronized progesterone or placebo. For women with one or more previous miscarriages, vaginal micronized progesterone increased the live birth rate compared to placebo (high‐quality evidence). Those women who had no previous miscarriages, but were now presenting with early pregnancy bleeding showed no improvement in live birth rate (high‐certainty evidence). \\nFor women with recurrent miscarriage, we based our findings on one study involving 826 women. Overall, vaginal micronized progesterone made little difference to the live birth rate when compared with placebo. The evidence for dydrogesterone compared with placebo for women with recurrent miscarriage is of very low‐certainty evidence, therefore the effects remain unclear. No data are available to assess the effectiveness of 17‐α‐hydroxyprogesterone or oral micronized progesterone for the outcome of live birth in women with recurrent miscarriage. \\nFrom the available data, there are likely no differences in adverse events associated with vaginal micronized progesterone. There was no difference in birth defects and side effects with vaginal micronized progesterone when compared with placebo. There was not enough information about safety and birth defects for us to analyse for all the other treatments. \\nWhat does this mean? \\nThe overall available evidence suggests that progestogens probably make little or no difference to live birth rate for women with threatened or recurrent miscarriage. Vaginal micronized progesterone may increase the live birth rate for women who are experiencing early pregnancy bleeding and have a history of one or more previous miscarriages, with likely no difference in adverse events. There is still uncertainty over the effectiveness and safety of alternative progestogen treatments for threatened and recurrent miscarriage. \\n', '10.1002-14651858.CD014962-pls.txt': 'Remdesivir to treat people with COVID‐19\\nIs remdesivir (an antiviral medicine) an effective treatment for COVID‐19? \\nKey messages \\n• For adults hospitalised with COVID‐19, remdesivir probably has little or no effect on deaths from any cause up to 28 days after treatment compared with placebo (sham treatment) or usual care.\\xa0 \\n• We are uncertain whether remdesivir improves or worsens patients’ condition, based on whether they needed more or less help with breathing. \\n• Researchers should agree on key outcomes to be used in COVID‐19 research, and future studies should investigate these areas. This would allow future updates of this review to draw more certain conclusions about the use of remdesivir to treat COVID‐19. \\nWhat is\\xa0remdesivir? \\nRemdesivir is a medicine that fights viruses. It has been shown to prevent the virus that causes COVID‐19 (SARS‐CoV‐2) from reproducing. Medical regulators have approved remdesivir for emergency use to treat people with COVID‐19.\\xa0 \\nWhat did we want to find out? \\nWe wanted to know if\\xa0remdesivir is an effective treatment for people in hospital with COVID‐19 and if it causes unwanted effects compared to placebo or usual care. \\nPeople with COVID‐19 are given different kinds of breathing support, depending on how severe their breathing difficulties are. We used the types of breathing support people received as a measure of the success of remdesivir in treating COVID‐19. Types of breathing support included: \\n• for severe breathing difficulties: invasive mechanical ventilation, when a breathing tube is put into patients’ lungs, and a machine (ventilator) breathes for them. Patients are given medicine to make them sedated whilst they are on a ventilator. \\n• for moderate to severe breathing difficulties: non‐invasive mechanical ventilation through a mask over the nose and/or mouth, or a helmet. Air or oxygen is pushed through the mask. Patients are generally awake for this treatment. \\n• for moderate breathing difficulties: oxygen via a mask or prongs that sit in the nostrils. Patients can still breathe room air. \\nWe were interested in the following outcomes:\\n• deaths from any cause in the 28 days after treatment;\\n• whether patients got better after treatment, measured by how long they spent on mechanical ventilation or oxygen; \\n• whether patients’ condition worsened so that they needed oxygen or mechanical ventilation;\\n• quality of life;\\n• any unwanted effects; and\\xa0\\n• serious unwanted effects.\\nWhat did we do?\\xa0 \\nWe searched for studies that investigated remdesivir to treat adults with COVID‐19 compared to placebo or standard care. Patients were hospitalised with COVID‐19 and could be of any gender or ethnicity. \\xa0 \\nWe compared and summarised the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes. \\nWhat did we find?\\xa0 \\nWe found\\xa05 studies with 7452 people hospitalised with COVID‐19. Of these, 3886 people were given remdesivir. The average age of patients was 59 years.

In 1000 people, 63 fewer would experience a serious unwanted effect compared to placebo or standard care. \\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence? \\nWe are moderately confident in the evidence for deaths from any cause and serious unwanted effects; however, our confidence in the other evidence is limited because studies used different methods to measure and record their results, and we did not find many studies for some of our outcomes of interest.\\xa0 \\nHow up‐to‐date is this evidence? \\nThe evidence is current to 16 April 2021.\\n', '10.1002-14651858.CD013373.pub2-pls.txt': 'When healthcare consumers (patients, carers and family members) and healthcare providers work together as partners to plan, deliver and evaluate health services, what effects does this have? \\nWhat are person‐centred health services? \\nTraditionally, health services have been developed by healthcare providers and focus on specific diseases or medical specialties. Involving consumers as partners in planning, delivering and evaluating health services may lead to services that are better able to meet the needs of and provide care for individuals.\\xa0 \\nWhy we did this Cochrane review \\nGovernments worldwide recommend that healthcare providers work with consumers to promote person‐centred health services. However, the effects of healthcare providers and consumers working together are unclear. \\nWe reviewed the evidence from research studies to find out about the effects of healthcare providers and consumers working together to plan, deliver and evaluate health services. \\nSpecifically, we wanted to know if consumers and healthcare providers working together in partnership – in the form of regular meetings in which consumers and providers were invited to contribute as equals to decisions about health services – had an impact on: \\n‐ changes to health services;\\n‐ the extent to which changes to health services reflected service users’ priorities;\\n‐ users’ ratings of health services;\\n‐ health service use; and\\n‐ time and money needed to make or act on decisions about health services.\\nWe also wanted to find out if there were any unwanted (adverse) effects.\\xa0\\xa0 \\xa0\\nWhat did we do? \\nFirst, we searched the medical literature for studies that compared:\\n‐ consumers and healthcare providers working in partnership against usual practice or other strategies with no partnership; or \\n‐ different ways of working in partnership (for example, with fewer or more consumers, or with online or face‐to‐face meetings). \\nWe then compared the results, and summarised the evidence from all the studies. Finally, we rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes, and the consistency of findings across studies. \\nWhat did we find? \\nWe found five studies that involved a total of 16,257 health service users and more than 469 health service providers. Three studies took place in high income‐countries and one each in middle‐ and low‐income countries. \\nThe studies compared:\\n‐ working in partnership against usual practice without partnership working (2 studies); and \\n‐ working in partnership as part of a wider strategy to promote person‐centred health services, against the same wider strategy without partnership working (3 studies). \\xa0 \\nNo studies evaluated one form of working in partnership compared to another.\\nWhat are the main results of our review? \\nThe studies provided insufficient evidence to determine if working in partnership had any effects compared to usual practice or wider strategies with no working in partnership. \\nNo studies investigated:\\n‐ impacts on the extent to which changes to health services reflected service users’ priorities, or \\n‐ the resources needed to make or act on decisions about health services.\\nFew studies investigated:\\n‐ impacts on changes to health services;\\n‐ users’ ratings of health services;\\n‐ health service use; and\\n‐ adverse events.\\nThe few studies that did investigate these outcomes either did not report usable information or produced findings in which we have very little confidence. These studies were small, used methods likely to introduce errors in their results and focused on specific settings or populations. Their results are unlikely to reflect the results of all the studies that have been conducted in this area, some of which have not made their results public yet. \\nWhat does this mean? \\nThere is not enough robust evidence to determine the effects of consumers and providers working in partnership to plan, deliver or evaluate health services. \\nThis review highlights the need for well‐designed studies with a clear focus on evaluating the effects of partnerships for promoting person‐centred care in health services. This area of research may also benefit from studies that investigate why certain partnerships between consumers and healthcare providers may be more successful than others, and an accompanying qualitative evidence synthesis addressing this aspect is forthcoming. \\nHow up‐to‐date is this review? \\nThe evidence in this Cochrane Review is current to April 2019.\\n', '10.1002-14651858.CD013251.pub2-pls.txt': \"Convective radiofrequency water vapour thermal therapy for lower urinary tract symptoms in men with benign prostatic hyperplasia \\nReview Question \\nWhat are the effects of convective radiofrequency water vapour thermal therapy in men with bothersome urinary symptoms because of an enlarged prostate? \\nBackground \\nProstate enlargement is common in older men, and can cause bothersome urinary symptoms, such as having to pass their water (voiding) often, a weak stream while voiding, or dribbling. If lifestyle changes and medications don't help, a variety of surgical procedures, including transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP), can improve these symptoms. They may also cause unwanted effects, such as problems with ejaculation or erections. Recently, a new procedure called 'convective radiofrequency water vapour thermal therapy' has become available. It is unclear how it compares to other treatments, such as TURP. \\nStudy characteristics  We found a single study, with 197 men, that compared convective radiofrequency water vapour thermal therapy to a sham procedure (men were made to believe they received treatment, while in reality, they did not), funded by the device company. The men's average age was 62.9 years, and most had a moderate degree of bothersome urinary symptoms. \\nWe found no studies that compared convective radiofrequency water vapour thermal therapy to another form of active treatment, such as TURP that men with an enlarged prostate and bothersome symptoms might otherwise choose. \\nKey results \\nCompared to a sham procedure, and with a three‐month follow‐up, convective radiofrequency water vapour thermal therapy may improve urinary symptoms (low certainty of evidence). Convective radiofrequency water vapour thermal therapy also likely improves quality of life (moderate certainty of evidence). We are very uncertain whether serious unwanted side effects are more common or not (very low certainty of evidence). Men's erections and ejaculations may be similar in men who have convective radiofrequency water vapour thermal therapy and those who receive the sham procedure (low certainty of evidence). \\nFindings of this review are up to date until 18 February 2020.\\nCertainty of the evidence \\nWe judged the certainty of the evidence for the outcomes to be moderate, low or very low. Reasons for not being so confident had to do with the study design and the study size. \\n\", '10.1002-14651858.CD012665.pub2-abstract.txt': \"Bilateral (two) versus unilateral (one) hearing aid(s) for bilateral hearing impairment in adults \\nReview question \\nShould adult patients with bilateral (two‐sided) hearing loss be fitted with one or two hearing aids? \\nBackground \\nHearing loss can be present from birth or can come on in later life. The latter is called 'acquired' hearing loss and is common. Its incidence increases markedly with age. In most people, 'age‐related' hearing loss is due to the loss of cells in the inner ear (so called 'sensorineural hearing loss') and affects both ears to the same degree. Hearing loss categorised as mild, moderate or severe is primarily managed with hearing aids. People with bilateral hearing loss may be offered one aid, fitted to one specific ear, or two aids fitted to both ears. There is uncertainty about the relative benefits to patients of these different strategies. \\nStudy characteristics \\nWe included four studies with a total of 209 patients, ranging in age from 23 to 85 and with more men than women. All the studies allowed the use of hearing aids for a total period of at least eight weeks before questions were asked about their preference for one or two aids. In all the studies the patients had bilateral hearing loss but there was considerable variation in what type of hearing loss they suffered from and how bad their hearing was. \\nThree of the studies were published before the mid‐1990s and the fourth study was published in 2011. Therefore, only the most recent study used 'modern' hearing aids similar to those that are widely available in high‐income countries. Of the four studies, two were conducted in the UK in National Health Service (NHS – public sector) patients. One of these looked at patients from primary care whose hearing loss had been picked up by a screening programme. The other looked at patients whose primary care practitioner thought they might benefit from hearing aids so had referred them to the local ENT department to get them. The other two studies were conducted in the United States: one study recruited only people on active military duty, or who had served in the military and had hearing loss due to being exposed to loud noises. About half of the people in the other study were ex‐military. \\nKey results and quality of the evidence \\nOnly one of the outcomes we thought was most important ‐ patient preference ‐ was reported in all studies. The percentage of patients who preferred two hearing aids to one varied between studies: this was 54% (51 out of 94), 39% (22 out of 56), 55% (16 out of 29) and 77% (23 out of 30), respectively. We did not combine the numbers from these four studies because it would not have been right to do so. We graded the quality of evidence for this outcome as very low on a scale that goes high – medium – low – very low. There was no information in the four studies on the other outcomes we were interested in. \\nConclusions \\nThis review identified only four studies comparing the use of one hearing aid with two. The studies were small and included people of widely varying ages. There was also considerable variation in the types of their deafness and in how deaf they were. \\nFor the most part, the types of hearing aid evaluated would now be regarded, in high‐income countries, as 'old technology', with only one study looking at 'modern' digital aids. However, we do not know if this is relevant or not. This review did not look at the differences between other 'old' and 'new' types of hearing aid. \\nWe could not combine the numbers from the four studies. Overall, this fact and the very low quality of the evidence leads us to conclude that we do not know if patients have a preference for one aid or two. Similarly, we do not know if a patient's quality of life is better with one or two aids. \\n\", '10.1002-14651858.CD015207-pls.txt': 'Does using low‐sodium salt substitutes (LSSS) instead of regular salt reduce blood pressure and heart disease risks, and is it safe? \\nKey messages \\n• In adults, using LSSS instead of regular salt in food probably lowers blood pressure slightly. Adults using LSSS instead of regular salt probably have a slightly lower risk of non‐fatal heart conditions, such as stroke or a sudden reduced blood flow to the heart, and death from heart disease. \\n• Using LSSS instead of regular salt probably also slightly increases the level of blood potassium (a mineral that keeps your heart beating at the right pace) in adults. This could be harmful for people who cannot effectively regulate the potassium in their bodies. Other evidence on safety is very limited. \\n• We are not certain about effects of using LSSS instead of regular salt on blood pressure in children, or whether using LSSS is safe in children. \\n• This evidence may not directly apply to people known to be at risk of high blood potassium, such as people with kidney problems or on certain medications. \\nWhat are low‐sodium salt substitutes (LSSS)? \\nLSSS are products with less sodium than regular salt. Amounts of sodium in LSSS are lowered by replacing some of the sodium with potassium or other minerals. LSSS may help lower risks of using regular salt, since eating lots of sodium and not enough potassium contributes to high blood pressure. Globally, high blood pressure is the largest cause of preventable deaths, mainly because it causes stroke, acute coronary syndrome (ACS; where less blood flows to the heart), and kidney problems. \\nHowever, LSSS also has potential health risks. Using LSSS may lead to higher than normal blood potassium (hyperkalaemia), which causes problems with the heartbeat speed and rhythm, or can cause the heart to stop. These risks are greater in certain people, for example, those whose kidneys do not work properly to remove potassium. \\nWhat did we want to find out? \\nWe wanted to find out what the effects of using LSSS instead of regular salt are on blood pressure as well as on events (stroke and ACS) and heart disease death. We also wanted to know if using LSSS instead of regular salt is safe, both in the general population and in people who are known to be at risk of high blood potassium levels. \\nWe wanted to find this out for adults, children and pregnant women.\\nWhat did we do?We searched five electronic databases and trial registries for studies that compared using LSSS with using regular salt. We compared and summarised the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the combined evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes.\\xa0 \\nWhat did we find? \\nWe found 26 trials* involving 34,961 adults and 92 children. No studies in pregnant women were found. Most trials were undertaken in rural or suburban areas, with more than half done in low‐ and middle‐income countries. Most trials included some people with high blood pressure (22); the largest included only people with a high risk of stroke. Seven trials were done in people at possible risk of high blood potassium. All trials excluded people where high potassium intake is known to be harmful, such as people with kidney problems or on certain medications. Nearly all trials (23) examined LSSS types where some sodium was replaced with potassium. The amount of sodium replaced in the various LSSS used in the trials ranged from very small (3%) to large (77%). \\n*Trials are types of studies in which participants are assigned randomly to two or more treatment groups. This is the best way to ensure similar groups of participants. \\nMain results \\nIn adults, LSSS probably lowers blood pressure (diastolic and systolic) slightly when compared to regular salt. Using LSSS also probably lowers risk of non‐fatal stroke, non‐fatal ACS and heart disease death slightly when compared to regular salt. \\nHowever, using LSSS instead of regular salt probably also slightly increases the level of potassium in the blood. \\nCompared to regular salt, LSSS may result in little to no difference in high blood pressure and hyperkalaemia. \\nWe could not draw any conclusions about effects of LSSS on blood pressure control, various heart disease events, death caused by stroke, lower than normal blood potassium (hypokalaemia), and other adverse events. \\nWe could not draw any conclusions about the effects or safety of using LSSS instead of regular salt in children. \\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\\xa0 \\nWe are moderately confident in the evidence. Our confidence was lowered mainly because of concerns about how some trials were conducted, and whether the results apply to the general population. We are not sure about the effects and safety of LSSS in children, pregnant women, people known to have a risk of high blood potassium, or those who do not have high blood pressure. We are also unsure about the effects of LSSS when used in foods not prepared at home. Further research may change these results. \\nHow up to date is this evidence? \\nThe evidence is up‐to‐date to August 2021.\\n', '10.1002-14651858.CD004418.pub4-abstract.txt': \"Initial antibiotic treatment for coverage of 'atypical' pathogens for community‐acquired pneumonia in hospitalized adults \\nPneumonia is a serious lung infection and is usually treated with antibiotics. Bacteria which cause community‐acquired pneumonia (CAP, pneumonia contracted outside healthcare settings) are traditionally divided into 'typical' and 'atypical', each dictating a different antibiotic treatment. Atypical bacteria include, Legionella pneumophila (L. pneumophila), Mycoplasma pneumoniae (M. pneumoniae) and Chlamydia pneumoniae (C. pneumoniae). The main 'typical' agent causing CAP is Streptococcus pneumoniae (S. pneumoniae). It is usually not possible to determine which of the many potential agents is the cause of CAP, so that antibiotic treatment is empirical, customarily covering both typical and atypical bacteria. While typical coverage is essential, the necessity of the atypical coverage has not been proven. In the previous version of this review we showed that there was no advantage to the atypical arm. Given the persisting inconsistency between current guidelines for treatment of pneumonia and the available evidence, we undertook to update this systematic review. \\nThis Cochrane review looked at trials comparing antibiotic regimens with atypical coverage to those without, limited to hospitalized adults with CAP. We included 28 trials, involving 5939 patients. For the regimens tested, no advantage was found for regimens covering atypical bacteria in the major outcomes tested ‐ mortality and clinical efficacy. There was no significant difference between the groups in the frequency of total adverse events, or those requiring discontinuation of treatment. However, gastrointestinal events were less common in the atypical arm. \\nThere are limitations to this review in that a single study compared the addition of the atypical antibiotic to a typical antibiotic, the major question in clinical practice; most compared a single atypical antibiotic to a single typical antibiotic. Seventeen of the 27 trials were open label, 21 of the 27 studies were sponsored by pharmaceutical companies of which all but one was conducted by the manufacturer of the atypical antibiotic. \\n\", '10.1002-14651858.CD013256.pub2-pls.txt': \"Infection risk after surgery in patients using medications for inflammatory bowel disease \\nBackground  \\nMore than 1.2 million individuals in North America are affected by inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). It is a condition that involves inflammation in the large and/or small intestine(s), resulting in symptoms such as diarrhea and abdominal pain. Many of the medications used to treat IBD suppress the immune system. As a result, use of these medications increases the risk of infection. This increased risk of infection is particularly concerning in patients undergoing surgery. \\nReview Question  \\nThis systematic review examined the combined data from 68 previously published studies to determine whether patients using IBD medications around the time of surgery had more infections compared to those not using the same medications. \\nStudy Characteristics  \\nThis systematic review is current up to 29 October 2019. It included 68 studies in patients with IBD who underwent surgery. Most participants were 18 years or older and both men and women were included. Five IBD medication groups were examined within our study. Infections were tracked up to 30 days after surgery. \\nKey Results  \\nAnalyses of this large set of data revealed that infection risk around the time of surgery varied depending on which type of IBD medication the patients were on. Patients being treated with corticosteroids or anti‐TNF agents seemed to have more infections after surgery, while those on 5‐ASA, immunomodulators or anti‐integrin agents did not seem to have more infections after surgery. These findings should be taken with caution as our review included studies which were of limited quality, and therefore we were not able to draw any firm conclusions.These findings could help doctors choose which medications to treat IBD patients with before surgery. Decisions should be tailored to each patient's unique health needs. In addition, this study suggests the need to carefully monitor for infections after surgery in patients who are on certain types of IBD medications.\\xa0 \\nLimitations  \\nOne limitation of this systematic review was its dependence on data from a wide range of previously published studies, with various approaches and quality control standards. Most studies examined had very low certainty regarding its conclusions. This review illustrates the need for future high‐quality research examining the impact of medications used to treat IBD on infection risk after surgery. \\n\"}\n"

Ensure that the generated text adheres to the following instructions which should be followed step-by-step: \n",
    "    a. Specific Structure: the generated PLS should be presented in a logical order, using the following order:  \n",
    "        1. Plain Title\n",
    "        2. Rationale\n",
    "        3. Trial Design\n",

    "    b. Sections should be authored following these parameters: \n",
    "        1. Plain Title: Simplified title understandable to a layperson that summarizes the research that was done. \n",
    "        2. Rationale: Include: background or study rationale providing a general description of the condition, what it may cause or why it is a burden for the patients; the reason and main hypothesis for the study; and why the study is needed, and why the study medication has the potential to treat the condition. \n",
    "        3. Trial Design: Answer ‘How is this study designed?’ Include the description of the design, description of study and patient population (age, health condition, genre), and the expected amount of time a person will be in the study.  \n",
    "        4. Results: answer ‘What were the main results of the study’, include what are the benefits for the patients, how the study was relevant for the area of study, and what are the conclusions from the investigator. \n",
    "    c. Consistency and Replicability: the generated PLS should be consistent regardless of the order of sentences or the specific phrasing used in the input protocol text. \n",
    "    d. Compliance with Plain Language Guidelines: The generated PLS must follow all of these plain language guidelines: \n",
    "        1. Have readability grade level of 6 or below. \n",
    "        2. Do not have jargon. All technical or medical words or terms should be defined or broken down into simple and logical explanations. \n",
    "        3. Active voice, not passive \n",
    "        4. Mostly one or two syllable words \n",
    "        5. Sentences of 15 words or less\n",
    "        6. Short paragraphs of 3-5 sentences\n",
    "        7. Simple numbers (eg, ratios, no percentages)\n",
    "    e. Do not invent Content: The AI model should not invent information. If the AI model includes data other than the one given in the input abstract, the AI model should guarantee such data is verified and real.\n",
