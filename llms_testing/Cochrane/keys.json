The disease leads to a gradual increase in corneal curvature and decrease in visual acuity with consequent impact on quality of life. Collagen cross\u2010linking (CXL) with ultraviolet A (UVA) light and riboflavin (vitamin B2) is a relatively new treatment that has been reported to slow or halt the progression of the disease in its early stages. \nObjectives\nThe objective of this review was to assess whether there is evidence that CXL is an effective and safe treatment for halting the progression of keratoconus compared to no treatment. \nSearch methods\nWe searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2014, Issue 7), Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid MEDLINE In\u2010Process and Other Non\u2010Indexed Citations, Ovid MEDLINE Daily, Ovid OLDMEDLINE (January 1946 to August 2014), EMBASE (January 1980 to August 2014), Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences Literature Database (LILACS) (1982 to August 2014), Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) (1982 to August 2014), OpenGrey (System for Information on Grey Literature in Europe) (www.opengrey.eu/), the metaRegister of Controlled Trials (mRCT) (www.controlled\u2010trials.com), ClinicalTrials.gov (www.clinicaltrials.gov) and the World Health Organisation International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (www.who.int/ictrp/search/en). We used no date or language restrictions in the electronic searches for trials. We last searched the electronic databases on 28 August 2014. \nSelection criteria\nWe included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) where CXL with UVA light and riboflavin was used to treat people with keratoconus and was compared to no treatment. \nData collection and analysis\nTwo review authors independently screened the search results, assessed trial quality, and extracted data using standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Our primary outcomes were two indicators of progression at 12 months: increase in maximum keratometry of 1.5 dioptres (D) or more and deterioration in uncorrected visual acuity of more than 0.2 logMAR. \nMain results\nWe included three RCTs conducted in Australia, the United Kingdom, and the United States that enrolled a total of 225 eyes and analysed 219 eyes. The total number of people enrolled was not clear in two of the studies. Only adults were enrolled into these studies. Out of the eyes analysed, 119 had CXL (all using the epithelium\u2010off technique) and 100 served as controls. One of these studies only reported comparative data on review outcomes. All three studies were at high risk for performance bias (lack of masking), detection bias (only one trial attempted to mask outcome assessment), and attrition bias (incomplete follow\u2010up). It was not possible to pool data due to differences in measuring and reporting outcomes. We identified a further three unpublished trials that potentially had enrolled a total of 195 participants. \nThere was limited evidence on the risk of progression. Analysis of the first few participants followed up to one year in one study suggested that eyes given CXL were less likely to have an increase in maximum keratometry of 1.5 D or more at 12 months compared to eyes given no treatment, but the confidence intervals (CI) were wide and compatible with no effect or more progression in the CXL group (risk ratio (RR) 0.12, 95% CI 0.01 to 2.00, 19 eyes). The same study reported the number of eyes with an increase of 2 D or more at 36 months in the whole cohort with a RR of 0.03 favouring CXL (95% CI 0.00 to 0.43, 94 eyes). Another study reported \"progression\" at 18 months using a different definition; people receiving CXL were less likely to progress, but again the effect was uncertain (RR 0.14, 95% CI 0.01 to 2.61, 44 eyes). We judged this to be very low\u2010quality evidence due to the risk of bias of included studies, imprecision, indirectness and publication bias but noted that the size of the potential effect was large. \nOn average, treated eyes had a less steep cornea (approximately 2 D less steep) (mean difference (MD) \u20101.92, 95% CI \u20102.54 to \u20101.30, 94 eyes, 1 RCT, very low\u2010quality evidence) and better uncorrected visual acuity (approximately 2 lines or 10 letters better) (MD \u20100.20, 95% CI \u20100.31 to \u20100.09, 94 eyes, 1 RCT, very low\u2010quality evidence) at 12 months. None of the studies reported loss of 0.2 logMAR acuity. The data on corneal thickness were inconsistent. There were no data available on quality of life or costs. Adverse effects were not uncommon but mostly transient and of low clinical significance. In one trial, 3 out of 12 participants treated with CXL had an adverse effect including corneal oedema, anterior chamber inflammation, and recurrent corneal erosions. In one trial at 3 years 3 out of 50 participants experienced adverse events including mild diffuse corneal oedema and paracentral infiltrate, peripheral corneal vascularisation, and subepithelial infiltrates and anterior chamber inflammation. No adverse effects were reported in the control groups. \nAuthors' conclusions\nThe evidence for the use of CXL in the management of keratoconus is limited due the lack of properly conducted RCTs. \n", "10.1002-14651858.CD003737.pub4-abstract.txt": "Background\nThe clinical management of intermittent exotropia (X(T)) has been discussed extensively in the literature, yet there remains a lack of clarity regarding indications for intervention, the most effective form of treatment, and whether there is an optimal time in the evolution of the disease at which any given treatment should be carried out. \nObjectives\nThe objective of this review was to analyze the effects of various surgical and non\u2010surgical treatments in randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of participants with intermittent exotropia, and to report intervention criteria and determine\u00a0whether the treatment effect varies by age and subtype of X(T). \nSearch methods\nWe searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2021, Issue 1), which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Trials Register; Ovid MEDLINE; Ovid Embase; Latin American and Caribbean Health Science Information database (LILACS); the ISRCTN registry; ClinicalTrials.gov, and the WHO ICTRP. The date of the search was 20 January 2021. We performed manual searches of the British Orthoptic Journal up to 2002, and the proceedings of the European Strabismological Association (ESA), International Strabismological Association (ISA), and American Association for Pediatric Ophthalmology and Strabismus meeting (AAPOS) up to 2001. \nSelection criteria\nWe included RCTs of any surgical or non\u2010surgical treatment for intermittent exotropia.\nData collection and analysis\nWe followed standard Cochrane methodology.\nMain results\nWe included six RCTs, four of which took place in the United States, and the remaining two in Asia (Turkey, India). A total of 890 participants with basic or distance X(T) were included, most of whom were children aged 12 months to 10 years. Three of these six studies were from the 2013 version of this review. Overall, the included studies had a high risk of performance bias as masking of participants and personnel administering treatment was not possible. \nTwo RCTs compared bilateral lateral rectus recession versus unilateral lateral rectus recession with medial rectus resection, but only one RCT (n = 197) reported on the primary outcomes of this review. Bilateral lateral rectus recession likely results in little difference in motor alignment at near (MD 1.00, 95% CI \u22122.69 to 4.69) and distance (MD 2.00, 95% CI \u22121.22 to 5.22) fixation as measured in pupillary distance using PACT (moderate\u2010certainty evidence). Bilateral lateral rectus recession may result in little to no difference in stereoacuity at near fixation (risk ratio (RR) 0.77, 95% CI 0.35 to 1.71), adverse events (RR 7.36, 95% CI 0.39 to 140.65), or quality of life measures (low\u2010certainty evidence). \nWe conducted a meta\u2010analysis of two RCTs comparing patching (n = 249) with active observation (n = 252), but were unable to conduct further meta\u2010analyses due to the clinical and methodological heterogeneity in the remaining trials. We found evidence that patching was clinically more effective than active observation in improving motor alignment at near (mean difference (MD) \u22122.23, 95% confidence interval (CI) \u22124.02 to \u22120.44) and distance (MD \u22122.00, 95% CI \u22123.40 to \u22120.61) fixation as measured by prism and alternate cover test (PACT) at six months (high\u2010certainty evidence). The evidence suggests that patching results in little to no difference in stereoacuity at near fixation (MD 0.00, 95% CI \u22120.07 to 0.07) (low\u2010certainty evidence). Stereoacuity at distance, motor fusion test, and quality of life measures were not reported. Adverse events were also not reported, but study authors explained that they were not anticipated due to the non\u2010surgical nature of patching. \nOne RCT (n = 38) compared prism adaptation test with eye muscle surgery versus eye muscle surgery alone. No review outcomes were reported. \nOne RCT (n = 60) compared lateral rectus recession and medial rectus plication versus lateral rectus recession and medial rectus resection. Lateral rectus recession and medial rectus plication may not improve motor alignment at distance (MD 0.66, 95% CI \u22121.06 to 2.38) (low\u2010certainty evidence). The evidence for the effect of lateral rectus recession and medial rectus plication on motor fusion test performance is very uncertain (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.48 to 1.74) (very low\u2010certainty evidence). \nAuthors' conclusions\nPatching confers a clinical benefit in children aged 12 months to 10 years of age with basic\u2010 or distance\u2010type X(T)\u00a0compared with active observation. There is insufficient evidence to determine whether interventions such as bilateral lateral rectus recession versus unilateral lateral rectus recession with medial rectus resection; lateral rectus recession and medial rectus plication versus lateral rectus recession and medial rectus resection; and prism adaptation test prior to eye muscle surgery versus eye muscle surgery alone may confer any benefit. \n", "10.1002-14651858.CD002948.pub2-abstract.txt": "Background\nHerbal medicine interventions have been identified as having potential benefit in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). \nObjectives\nTo update an existing systematic (Cochrane) review of herbal therapies in RA.\nSearch methods\nWe searched electronic databases Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library), MEDLINE, EMBASE, AMED, CINAHL, Web of Science, Dissertation Abstracts (1996 to 2009), unrestricted by language, and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform in October 2010. \nSelection criteria\nRandomised controlled trials of herbal interventions compared with placebo or active controls in RA. \nData collection and analysis\nTwo authors selected trials for inclusion, assessed risk of bias and extracted data.\u00a0\nMain results\nTwelve new studies were added to the update, a total of 22 studies were included.\nEvidence from seven studies indicate potential benefits of gamma linolenic acid (GLA) from evening primrose oil, borage seed oil, or blackcurrent seed oil, in terms of reduced pain intensity (mean difference (MD) \u201032.83 points, 95% confidence interval (CI) \u201056.25 to \u20109.42,100 point pain scale); improved disability (MD \u201015.75% 95% CI \u201027.06 to \u20104.44%); and an increase in adverse events (GLA 20% versus placebo 3%), that was not statistically different (relative risk 4.24, 95% CI 0.78 to 22.99). \nThree studies compared Tripterygium wilfordii (thunder god vine) to placebo and one to sulfasalazine and indicated improvements in some outcomes, but data could not be pooled due to differing interventions, comparisons and outcomes. One study reported serious side effects with oral Tripterygium wilfordii Hook F. In the follow\u2010up studies, all side effects were mild to moderate and resolved after the intervention ceased. Two studies compared Phytodolor\u00ae N to placebo but poor reporting limited data extraction. The remaining studies each considered differing herbal interventions. \nAuthors' conclusions\nSeveral herbal interventions are inadequately justified by single studies or non\u2010comparable studies in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. There is moderate evidence that oils containing GLA (evening primrose, borage, or blackcurrant seed oil) afford some benefit in relieving symptoms for RA, while evidence for Phytodolor\u00ae N is less convincing.Tripterygium wilfordii products may reduce some RA symptoms, however, oral use may be associated with several side effects. Many trials of herbal therapies are hampered by research design flaws and inadequate reporting. Further investigation of each herbal therapy is warranted, particularly via well designed, fully powered, confirmatory clinical trials that use American College of Rheumatology improvement criteria to measure outcomes and report results according to CONSORT guidelines. \n", "10.1002-14651858.CD004019.pub4-abstract.txt": "Background\nPatients with unicompartmental osteoarthritis of the knee can be treated with an osteotomy. The goal of an osteotomy is to unload the diseased compartment of the knee. This is the second update of the original review published in The Cochrane Library, Issue 1, 2005. \nObjectives\nTo assess the benefits and harms of an osteotomy for treating patients with knee osteoarthritis, including the following main outcomes scores: treatment failure, pain and function scores, health\u2010related quality of life, serious adverse events, mortality and reoperation rate. \nSearch methods\nThe Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE and EMBASE (Current Contents, HealthSTAR) were searched until November 2013 for this second update. \nSelection criteria\nRandomised and controlled clinical trials comparing an osteotomy with other treatments for patients with unicompartmental osteoarthritis of the knee. \nData collection and analysis\nTwo review authors independently selected trials, extracted data and assessed risk of bias using the domains recommended in the 'Risk of bias' tool of The Cochrane Collaboration. The quality of the results was analysed by performing overall grading of evidence by outcome using the GRADE (Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation) approach. \nMain results\nEight new studies were included in this update, for a total of 21 included studies involving 1065 people. \nIn four studies, the randomised sequence was adequately generated and clearly described. In eight studies, allocation concealment was adequately generated and described. In four studies, the blinding procedures were sufficient. In six studies, incomplete outcome data were not adequately addressed. Furthermore, in 11 studies, the selective outcome reporting item was unclear because no study protocol was provided. \nFollow\u2010up of studies comparing different osteotomy techniques was too short to measure treatment failure, which implicates revision to a knee arthroplasty. \nFour studies evaluated a closing wedge high tibial osteotomy (CW\u2010HTO) with another high tibial osteotomy (aHTO). Based on these studies, the CW\u2010HTO group had 1.8% (95% confidence interval (CI) \u20107.7% to 4.2%; low\u2010quality evidence) more pain compared with the aHTO group; this finding was not statistically significant. Pooled function in the CW\u2010HTO group was 0.5% (95% CI \u20103.8% to 2.8%; low\u2010quality evidence) higher compared with the aHTO group; this finding was not statistically significant. No data on health\u2010related quality of life and mortality were presented. \nSerious adverse events were reported in only four studies and were not significantly different (low\u2010quality evidence) between groups. The reoperation rate were scored as early hardware removal because of pain and pin track infection due to the external fixator. Risk of reoperation was 2.6 (95% CI 1.5 to 4.5; low\u2010quality evidence) times higher in the aHTO group compared with the CW\u2010HTO group, and this finding was statistically significant. \nThe quality of evidence for most outcomes comparing different osteotomy techniques was downgraded to low because of the numbers of available studies, the numbers of participants and limitations in design. \nTwo studies compared high tibial osteotomy versus unicompartmental knee replacement. Treatment failure and pain and function scores were not different between groups after a mean follow\u2010up of 7.5 years. The osteotomy group reported more adverse events when compared with the unicompartmental knee replacement group, but the difference was not statistically significant. No data on health\u2010related quality of life and mortality were presented. \nNo study compared an osteotomy versus conservative treatment.\nTen included studies compared differences in perioperative or postoperative conditions after high tibial osteotomy. In most of these studies, no statistically significant differences in outcomes were noted between groups. \nAuthors' conclusions\nThe conclusion of this update did not change: Valgus high tibial osteotomy reduces pain and improves knee function in patients with medial compartmental osteoarthritis of the knee. However, this conclusion is based on within\u2010group comparisons, not on non\u2010operative controls. No evidence suggests differences between different osteotomy techniques. No evidence shows whether an osteotomy is more effective than alternative surgical treatment such as unicompartmental knee replacement or non\u2010operative treatment. So far, the results of this updated review do not justify a conclusion on benefit of specific high tibial osteotomy technique for knee osteoarthritis. \n", "10.1002-14651858.CD009481.pub2-abstract.txt": "Background\nThe most commonly used types of phototherapy for treating psoriasis are narrow\u2010band ultraviolet B (NB\u2010UVB); broad\u2010band ultraviolet B (BB\u2010UVB), which includes selective (delivering radiation with a wavelength range of 305 to 325 nm) and conventional BB\u2010UVB (280 to 320 nm); and psoralen ultraviolet A photochemotherapy (oral or bath PUVA). There is substantial controversy regarding their efficacy when compared with each other. \nObjectives\nTo assess the effects of narrow\u2010band ultraviolet B phototherapy versus broad\u2010band ultraviolet B or psoralen ultraviolet A photochemotherapy for psoriasis. \nSearch methods\nWe searched the following databases up to August 2013: the Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL in The Cochrane Library (2013, Issue 7), MEDLINE (from 1946), and EMBASE (from 1974). We searched the following databases up to November 2012: CNKI (from 1974) and CBM (from 1978). We also searched trials registers and the OpenGrey database. \nSelection criteria\nWe included all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared NB\u2010UVB phototherapy with BB\u2010UVB or PUVA for treating psoriasis, which included chronic plaque psoriasis (CPP), guttate psoriasis (GP), and palmoplantar psoriasis (PPP). \nData collection and analysis\nTwo review authors independently conducted the study selection, 'Risk of bias' assessment, and data extraction. \nMain results\nWe included 13 RCTs, with a total of 662 participants. We report the results of intention\u2010to\u2010treat analyses (ITT) here. Our primary outcomes of interest were as follows: Participant\u2010rated global improvement, Percentage of participants reaching Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) 75 (which meant equal to or more than 75% reduction in PASI score), Withdrawal due to side\u2010effects, and Clearance rate. \nIn one RCT of NB\u2010UVB compared with oral PUVA in participants with CPP, the difference in PASI 75 was not statistically significant (risk ratio (RR) 0.91, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.63 to 1.32; N = 51; low quality). In three other RCTs of CPP, the clearance rates were inconsistent because in one, there was no difference between the groups (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.12; N = 54), and in the other two, the clearance rates were statistically significantly in favour of oral PUVA: RR 0.66, 95% CI 0.47 to 0.93; N = 93 and RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.59 to 0.96; N = 100, respectively. Pooled data from these three studies indicated that withdrawals due to adverse events were not significantly different between either group (RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.20 to 2.54; N = 247; low quality). \nThe evidence from the comparison of NB\u2010UVB with bath PUVA in terms of clearance rate for CPP was also inconsistent: Pooled data from two left\u2010right body comparison RCTs found no significant difference between the NB\u2010UVB and bath PUVA groups (RR 1.79, 95% CI 0.46 to 6.91; N = 92; low quality), while a parallel RCT favoured bath PUVA (RR 0.18, 95% CI 0.05 to 0.71; N = 36; low quality). \nIn participants with PPP, one RCT found there were no significant differences between NB\u2010UVB treated sides and topical PUVA treated sides in terms of clearance rate (RR 0.09, 95% CI 0.01 to 1.56; N = 50; low quality). \nTwo RCTs found NB\u2010UVB plus retinoid (re\u2010NB\u2010UVB) and PUVA plus retinoid (re\u2010PUVA) had similar effects for treating people with CPP or GP in terms of clearance rate (RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.10; N = 90; low quality). \nOne RCT in people with CPP found no significant differences between NB\u2010UVB and selective BB\u2010UVB in terms of clearance rate (RR 1.40, 95% CI 0.92 to 2.13; N = 100; low quality) and withdrawals due to adverse events (RR 3.00, 95% CI 0.32 to 27.87; N = 100; low quality). \nNo studies reported our primary outcomes for NB\u2010UVB compared with conventional BB\u2010UVB.\nAuthors' conclusions\nCurrent evidence is very heterogeneous and needs to be interpreted with caution. The clearance rate between oral PUVA and NB\u2010UVB is inconsistent among the included studies. Evidence regarding NB\u2010UVB versus bath PUVA is also inconsistent. Re\u2010NB\u2010UVB and re\u2010PUVA are similarly effective for treating people with CPP or GP. In practice, NB\u2010UVB may be more convenient to use since exogenous photosensitiser is not required before phototherapy. \nNB\u2010UVB is considered ineffective for PPP in clinical practice, and a small RCT did not detect a statistically significant difference between NB\u2010UVB and topical PUVA for clearing PPP.

The overall risk of bias was found to be variable, with most studies reporting adequate methods for randomisation but only two studies reporting adequate data on allocation concealment. Four studies (355 patients) compared 5 mg versus 10 mg loading doses. All four studies reported INR in\u2010range by day five. Although there was notable heterogeneity, pooling of these four studies showed no overall difference between 5 mg versus 10 mg loading doses (RR 1.17, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.77, P = 0.46, I2 = 83%). Two of these studies used two consecutive INRs in\u2010range as the outcome and showed no difference between a 5 mg and 10 mg dose by day five (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.62 to 1.19, P = 0.37, I2\u00a0= 22%); two other studies used a single INR in\u2010range as the outcome and showed a benefit for the 10 mg initiation dose by day 5 (RR 1.49, 95% CI 1.01 to 2.21, P = 0.05, I2\u00a0= 72%). Two studies compared a 5 mg dose to other doses: a 2.5 mg initiation dose took longer to achieve the therapeutic range (2.7 versus 2.0 days; P < 0.0001), but those receiving a calculated initiation dose achieved a target range quicker (4.2 days versus 5 days, P = 0.007). Two studies compared age adjusted doses to 10 mg initiation doses. More elderly patients receiving an age adjusted dose achieved a stable INR compared to those receiving a 10 mg initial dose (and Fennerty regimen). Four studies used genotype guided dosing in one arm of each trial. Three studies reported no overall differences; the fourth study, which reported that the genotype group spent significantly more time in\u2010range (P < 0.001), had a control group whose INRs were significantly lower than expected. No clear impacts from adverse events were found in either arm to make an overall conclusion. \nAuthors' conclusions\nThe studies in this review compared loading doses in several different situations. There is still considerable uncertainty between the use of a 5 mg and a 10 mg loading dose for the initiation of warfarin. In the elderly, there is some evidence that lower initiation doses or age adjusted doses are more appropriate, leading to fewer high INRs.

We assessed the effects of treatment on pain reduction, disability, global improvement, adverse events, and return to work. \nData collection and analysis\nTwo review authors independently selected trials to be included in this review, evaluated the risk of bias, and extracted the data. If appropriate, we performed a meta\u2010analysis, using a random\u2010effects model throughout, due to expected variability between studies. We assessed the quality of the evidence using the GRADE approach. We used standard methodological procedures recommended by Cochrane. \nMain results\nWe included 32 trials, with a total of 5356 participants (age range 16 to 78 years). Follow\u2010up ranged from one day to six months. Studies were conducted across the globe, the majority taking place in Europe and North\u2010America. Africa and the Eastern Mediterranean region were not represented. We considered seven studies at low risk of bias. Performance and attrition were the most common biases. There was often a lack of information on randomisation procedures and allocation concealment (selection bias); studies were prone to selective reporting bias, since most studies did not register their trials. Almost half of the studies were industry\u2010funded. \nThere is moderate quality evidence that NSAIDs are slightly more effective in short\u2010term (\u2264 3 weeks) reduction of pain intensity (visual analogue scale (VAS), 0 to 100) than placebo (mean difference (MD) \u20107.29 (95% confidence interval (CI) \u201010.98 to \u20103.61; 4 RCTs, N = 815). There is high quality evidence that NSAIDs are slightly more effective for short\u2010term improvement in disability (Roland Morris Disability Questionnaire (RMDQ), 0 to 24) than placebo (MD \u20102.02, 95% CI \u20102.89 to \u20101.15; 2 RCTs, N = 471). The magnitude of these effects is small and probably not clinically relevant. There is low quality evidence that NSAIDs are slightly more effective for short\u2010term global improvement than placebo (risk ratio (RR) 1.40, 95% CI 1.12 to 1.75; 5 RCTs, N = 1201), but there was substantial heterogeneity (I\u00b2 52%) between studies. There is very low quality evidence of no clear difference in the proportion of participants experiencing adverse events when using NSAIDs compared to placebo (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.63 to 1.18; 6 RCTs, N = 1394). There is very low quality evidence of no clear difference between the proportion of participants who could return to work after seven days between those who used NSAIDs and those who used placebo (RR 1.48, 95% CI 0.98 to 2.23; 1 RCT, N = 266). \nThere is low quality evidence of no clear difference in short\u2010term reduction of pain intensity between those who took selective COX\u20102 inhibitor NSAIDs compared to non\u2010selective NSAIDs (mean change from baseline \u20102.60, 95% CI \u20109.23 to 4.03; 2 RCTs, N = 437). There is moderate quality evidence of conflicting results for short\u2010term disability improvement between groups (2 RCTs, N = 437). Low quality evidence from one trial (N = 333) reported no clear difference between groups in the proportion of participants experiencing global improvement. There is very low quality evidence of no clear difference in the proportion of participants experiencing adverse events between those who took COX\u20102 inhibitors and non\u2010selective NSAIDs (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.63 to 1.50; 2 RCTs, N = 444). No data were reported for return to work. \nAuthors' conclusions\nThis updated Cochrane Review included 32 trials to evaluate the efficacy of NSAIDs in people with acute LBP. The quality of the evidence ranged from high to very low, thus further research is (very) likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimates of effect, and may change the estimates. \nNSAIDs seemed slightly more effective than placebo for short\u2010term pain reduction (moderate certainty), disability (high certainty), and global improvement (low certainty), but the magnitude of the effects is small and probably not clinically relevant. \nThere was no clear difference in short\u2010term pain reduction (low certainty) when comparing selective COX\u20102 inhibitors to non\u2010selective NSAIDs. \nWe found very low evidence of no clear difference in the proportion of participants experiencing adverse events in both the comparison of NSAIDs versus placebo and selective COX\u20102 inhibitors versus non\u2010selective NSAIDs. \nWe were unable to draw conclusions about adverse events and the safety of NSAIDs for longer\u2010term use, since we only included RCTs with a primary focus on short\u2010term use of NSAIDs and a short follow\u2010up. These are not optimal for answering questions about longer\u2010term or rare adverse events. \n", "10.1002-14651858.CD006682.pub6-abstract.txt": "Background\nProgressive lung damage from recurrent exacerbations is the major cause of mortality and morbidity in cystic fibrosis. Life expectancy of people with cystic fibrosis has increased dramatically in the last 40 years. One of the major reasons for this increase is the mounting use of antibiotics to treat chest exacerbations caused by bacterial infections. The optimal duration of intravenous antibiotic therapy is not clearly defined. Individuals usually receive intravenous antibiotics for 14 days, but treatment may range from 10 to 21 days. A shorter duration of antibiotic treatment risks inadequate clearance of infection which could lead to further lung damage. Prolonged courses of intravenous antibiotics are expensive and inconvenient. The risk of systemic side effects such as allergic reactions to antibiotics also increases with prolonged courses and the use of aminoglycosides requires frequent monitoring to minimise some of their side effects. However, some organisms which infect people with cystic fibrosis are known to be multi\u2010resistant to antibiotics, and may require a longer course of treatment. This is an update of previously published reviews. \nObjectives\nTo assess the optimal duration of intravenous antibiotic therapy for treating chest exacerbations in people with cystic fibrosis. \nSearch methods\nWe searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Trials Register which comprises references identified from comprehensive electronic database searches, handsearches of relevant journals, abstract books and conference proceedings. Most recent search of the Group's Cystic Fibrosis Trials Register: 30 May 2019. \nWe also searched online trials registries. Most recent search of the ClinicalTrials.gov and WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) portal: 06 January 2019. \nSelection criteria\nRandomised and quasi\u2010randomised controlled trials comparing different durations of intravenous antibiotic courses for acute respiratory exacerbations in people with CF, either with the same drugs at the same dosage, the same drugs at a different dosage or frequency or different antibiotics altogether, including studies with additional therapeutic agents. \nData collection and analysis\nNo eligible trials were identified for inclusion. A trial looking at the standardised treatment of pulmonary exacerbations is currently ongoing and will be included when the results are published.\u00a0 \nMain results\nNo eligible trials were included.\nAuthors' conclusions\nThere are no clear guidelines on the optimum duration of intravenous antibiotic treatment. Duration of treatment is currently based on unit policies and response to treatment. Shorter duration of treatment should improve quality of life and adherence, result in a reduced incidence of drug reactions and be less costly. However, the shorter duration may not be sufficient to clear a chest infection and may result in an early recurrence of an exacerbation. This systematic review identifies the need for a multicentre, randomised controlled trial comparing different durations of intravenous antibiotic treatment as it has important clinical and financial implications. The currently ongoing STOP2 trial is expected to provide some guidance on these questions when published. \n", "10.1002-14651858.CD010852.pub2-abstract.txt": "Background\nInduction of labour using pharmacological and mechanical methods can increase complications. Complementary and alternative medicine methods including hypnosis may have the potential to provide a safe alternative option for the induction of labour. However, the effectiveness of hypnosis for inducing labour has not yet been fully evaluated. \nObjectives\nTo assess the effect of hypnosis for induction of labour compared with no intervention or any other interventions. \nSearch methods\nWe searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (31 January 2014), handsearched relevant conference proceedings, contacted key personnel and organisations in the field for published and unpublished references. \nSelection criteria\nAll published and unpublished randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and cluster\u2010RCTs of acceptable quality comparing hypnosis with no intervention or any other interventions, in which the primary outcome is to assess whether labour was induced. \nData collection and analysis\nTwo review authors assessed the one trial report that was identified (but was subsequently excluded). \nMain results\nNo RCTs or cluster\u2010RCTs were identified from the search strategy.\nAuthors' conclusions\nThere was no evidence available from RCTs to assess the effect of hypnosis for induction of labour. Evidence from RCTs is required to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of this intervention for labour induction. As hypnosis may delay standard care (in case standard care is withheld during hypnosis), its use in induction of labour should be considered on a case\u2010by\u2010case basis. \nFuture RCTs are required to examine the effectiveness and safety of hypnotic relaxation for induction of labour among pregnant women who have anxiety above a certain level. The length and timing of the intervention, as well as the staff training required, should be taken into consideration. Moreover, the views and experiences of women and staff should also be included in future RCTs. \n", "10.1002-14651858.CD001218.pub3-abstract.txt": "Background\nAcupuncture is often used for migraine prevention but its effectiveness is still controversial. We present an update of our Cochrane review from 2009. \nObjectives\nTo investigate whether acupuncture is a) more effective than no prophylactic treatment/routine care only; b) more effective than sham (placebo) acupuncture; and c) as effective as prophylactic treatment with drugs in reducing headache frequency in adults with episodic migraine. \nSearch methods\nWe searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL: 2016, issue 1); MEDLINE (via Ovid, 2008 to January 2016); Ovid EMBASE (2008 to January 2016); and Ovid AMED (1985 to January 2016). We checked PubMed for recent publications to April 2016. We searched the World Health Organization (WHO) Clinical Trials Registry Platform to February 2016 for ongoing and unpublished trials. \nSelection criteria\nWe included randomized trials at least eight weeks in duration that compared an acupuncture intervention with a no\u2010acupuncture control (no prophylactic treatment or routine care only), a sham\u2010acupuncture intervention, or prophylactic drug in participants with episodic migraine. \nData collection and analysis\nTwo reviewers checked eligibility; extracted information on participants, interventions, methods and results, and assessed risk of bias and quality of the acupuncture intervention. The primary outcome was migraine frequency (preferably migraine days, attacks or headache days if migraine days not measured/reported) after treatment and at follow\u2010up. The secondary outcome was response (at least 50% frequency reduction). Safety outcomes were number of participants dropping out due to adverse effects and number of participants reporting at least one adverse effect. We calculated pooled effect size estimates using a fixed\u2010effect model. We assessed the evidence using GRADE and created 'Summary of findings' tables. \nMain results\nTwenty\u2010two trials including 4985 participants in total (median 71, range 30 to 1715) met our updated selection criteria. We excluded five previously included trials from this update because they included people who had had migraine for less than 12 months, and included five new trials. Five trials had a no\u2010acupuncture control group (either treatment of attacks only or non\u2010regulated routine care), 15 a sham\u2010acupuncture control group, and five a comparator group receiving prophylactic drug treatment. In comparisons with no\u2010acupuncture control groups and groups receiving prophylactic drug treatment, there was risk of performance and detection bias as blinding was not possible. Overall the quality of the evidence was moderate. \nComparison with no acupuncture \nAcupuncture was associated with a moderate reduction of headache frequency over no acupuncture after treatment (four trials, 2199 participants; standardised mean difference (SMD) \u20100.56; 95% CI \u20100.65 to \u20100.48); findings were statistically heterogeneous (I\u00b2 = 57%; moderate quality evidence). After treatment headache frequency at least halved in 41% of participants receiving acupuncture and 17% receiving no acupuncture (pooled risk ratio (RR) 2.40; 95% CI 2.08 to 2.76; 4 studies, 2519 participants) with a corresponding number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) of 4 (95% CI 3 to 6); there was no indication of statistical heterogeneity (I\u00b2 = 7%; moderate quality evidence). The only trial with post\u2010treatment follow\u2010up found a small but significant benefit 12 months after randomisation (RR 2.16; 95% CI 1.35 to 3.45; NNT 7; 95% 4 to 25; 377 participants, low quality evidence). \nComparison with sham acupuncture \nBoth after treatment (12 trials, 1646 participants) and at follow\u2010up (10 trials, 1534 participants), acupuncture was associated with a small but statistically significant frequency reduction over sham (moderate quality evidence). The SMD was \u20100.18 (95% CI \u20100.28 to \u20100.08; I\u00b2 = 47%) after treatment and \u20100.19 (95% CI \u20100.30 to \u20100.09; I\u00b2 = 59%) at follow\u2010up. After treatment headache frequency at least halved in 50% of participants receiving true acupuncture and 41% receiving sham acupuncture (pooled RR 1.23, 95% CI 1.11 to 1.36; I\u00b2 = 48%; 14 trials, 1825 participants) and at follow\u2010up in 53% and 42%, respectively (pooled RR 1.25, 95% CI 1.13 to 1.39; I\u00b2 = 61%; 11 trials, 1683 participants; moderate quality evidence). The corresponding NNTBs are 11 (95% CI 7.00 to 20.00) and 10 (95% CI 6.00 to 18.00), respectively. The number of participants dropping out due to adverse effects (odds ratio (OR) 2.84; 95% CI 0.43 to 18.71; 7 trials, 931 participants; low quality evidence) and the number of participants reporting adverse effects (OR 1.15; 95% CI 0.85 to 1.56; 4 trials, 1414 participants; moderate quality evidence) did not differ significantly between acupuncture and sham groups. \nComparison with prophylactic drug treatment \nAcupuncture reduced migraine frequency significantly more than drug prophylaxis after treatment ( SMD \u20100.25; 95% CI \u20100.39 to \u20100.10; 3 trials, 739 participants), but the significance was not maintained at follow\u2010up (SMD \u20100.13; 95% CI \u20100.28 to 0.01; 3 trials, 744 participants; moderate quality evidence). After three months headache frequency at least halved in 57% of participants receiving acupuncture and 46% receiving prophylactic drugs (pooled RR 1.24; 95% CI 1.08 to 1.44) and after six months in 59% and 54%, respectively (pooled RR 1.11; 95% CI 0.97 to 1.26; moderate quality evidence). Findings were consistent among trials with I\u00b2 being 0% in all analyses. Trial participants receiving acupuncture were less likely to drop out due to adverse effects (OR 0.27; 95% CI 0.08 to 0.86; 4 trials, 451 participants) and to report adverse effects (OR 0.25; 95% CI 0.10 to 0.62; 5 trials 931 participants) than participants receiving prophylactic drugs (moderate quality evidence). \nAuthors' conclusions\nThe available evidence suggests that adding acupuncture to symptomatic treatment of attacks reduces the frequency of headaches. Contrary to the previous findings, the updated evidence also suggests that there is an effect over sham, but this effect is small. The available trials also suggest that acupuncture may be at least similarly effective as treatment with prophylactic drugs. Acupuncture can be considered a treatment option for patients willing to undergo this treatment. As for other migraine treatments, long\u2010term studies, more than one year in duration, are lacking. \n", "10.1002-14651858.CD008288.pub2-abstract.txt": "Background\nPatients with diabetes frequently use complimentary and alternative medications including Ayurvedic medications and hence it is important to determine their efficacy and safety. \nObjectives\nTo assess the effects of Ayurvedic treatments for diabetes mellitus.\nSearch methods\nWe searched The Cochrane Library (issue 10, 2011), MEDLINE (until 31 August 2011), EMBASE (until 31 August 2011), AMED (until 14 October 2011), the database of randomised trials from South Asia (until 14 October 2011), the database of the grey literature (OpenSigle, until 14 October 2011) and databases of ongoing trials (until 14 October 2011). In addition we performed hand searches of several journals and reference lists of potentially relevant trials. \nSelection criteria\nWe included randomized trials of at least two months duration of Ayurvedic interventions for diabetes mellitus. Participants of both genders, all ages and any type of diabetes were included irrespective of duration of diabetes, antidiabetic treatment, comorbidity or diabetes related complications. \nData collection and analysis\nTwo authors independently extracted data. Risk of bias of trials was evaluated as indicated in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Intervention. \nMain results\nResults of only a limited number of studies could be combined, in view of different types of interventions and variable quality of data. We found six trials of proprietary herbal mixtures and one of whole system Ayurvedic treatment. These studies enrolled 354 participants ( 172 on treatment, 158 on controls, 24 allocation unknown). The treatment duration ranged from 3 to 6 months. All these studies included adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus. \nWith regard to our primary outcomes, significant reductions in glycosylated haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), fasting blood sugar (FBS) or both were observed with Diabecon, Inolter and Cogent DB compared to placebo or no additional treatment, while no significant hypoglycaemic response was found with Pancreas tonic and Hyponidd treatment. The study of whole system Ayurvedic treatment did not provide data on HbA1c and FBS values. One study of Pancreas tonic treatment did not detect a significant change in health\u2010related quality of life. The main adverse effects reported were drug hypersensitivity (one study, one patient in the treatment arm); hypoglycaemic episodes (one study, one participant in the treatment arm; none had severe hypoglycaemia) and gastrointestinal side effects in one study (1 of 20 in the intervention group and 0 of 20 participants in the control group). None of the included studies reported any deaths, renal, hematological or liver toxicity. \nWith regard to our secondary outcomes, post prandial blood sugar (PPBS) was lower among participants treated with Diabecon, was unchanged with Hyponidd and was higher in patients treated with Cogent DB. Treatment with Pancreas tonic and Hyponidd did not affect lipid profile significantly, while patients treated with Inolter had significantly higher HDL\u2010 and lower LDL\u2010cholesterol as well as lower triglycerides. Cogent DB treated participants also had lower total cholesterol and triglycerides. \nStudies of treatment with Diabecon reported increased fasting insulin levels; one study of treatment with Diabecon reported higher stimulated insulin levels and fasting C\u2010peptide levels in the treatment group. There was no significant difference in fasting and stimulated C\u2010peptide and insulin levels with Hyponidd, Cogent DB and Pancreas tonic treatment. The study of Inolter did not assess these outcomes. \nNo study reported on or was designed to investigate diabetic complications, death from any cause and economic data. \nAuthors' conclusions\nAlthough there were significant glucose\u2010lowering effects with the use of some herbal mixtures, due to methodological deficiencies and small sample sizes we are unable to draw any definite conclusions regarding their efficacy. Though no significant adverse events were reported, there is insufficient evidence at present to recommend the use of these interventions in routine clinical practice and further studies are needed. \n", "10.1002-14651858.CD007920.pub3-abstract.txt": "Background\nNeovascular glaucoma (NVG) is a potentially blinding, secondary glaucoma. It is caused by the formation of abnormal new blood vessels, which prevent normal drainage of aqueous from the anterior segment of the eye. Anti\u2010vascular endothelial growth factor (anti\u2010VEGF) medications are specific inhibitors of the primary mediators of neovascularization. Studies have reported\u00a0the effectiveness of anti\u2010VEGF medications for the control of intraocular pressure (IOP) in NVG. \nObjectives\nTo assess the effectiveness of intraocular anti\u2010VEGF medications, alone or with one or more type of conventional therapy, compared with no anti\u2010VEGF medications for the treatment of NVG. \nSearch methods\nWe searched CENTRAL (which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Trials Register); MEDLINE; Embase; PubMed; and LILACS to 22 March 2019; metaRegister of Controlled Trials to 13 August 2013; and two additional trial registers to 22 March 2019. We did not use any date or language restrictions in the electronic search for trials. \nSelection criteria\nWe included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of people treated with anti\u2010VEGF medications for NVG. \nData collection and analysis\nTwo review authors independently assessed the search results for trials, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias, and the certainty of the evidence. We resolved discrepancies through discussion. \nMain results\nWe included four RCTs (263 participants) and identified one ongoing RCT. Each trial was conducted in a different country: China, Brazil, Egypt, and Japan. We assessed the trials to have an unclear risk of bias for most domains due to insufficient information. Two trials compared intravitreal bevacizumab combined with Ahmed valve implantation and panretinal photocoagulation (PRP) with Ahmed valve implantation and PRP. We did not combine these two trials due to substantial clinical and statistical heterogeneity. One trial randomised participants to receive an injection of either an intravitreal anti\u2010VEGF medication or placebo at the first visit, followed by non\u2010randomised treatment according to clinical findings after one week. The last trial randomised participants to PRP with and without ranibizumab, but details of the study were unavailable for further analysis. \nTwo trials that examined IOP showed inconsistent results. One found inconclusive results for mean IOP between participants who received anti\u2010VEGF medications and those who did not, at one month (mean difference [MD] \u20101.60 mmHg, 95% confidence interval [CI] \u20104.98 to 1.78; 40 participants), and at one year (MD 1.40 mmHg, 95% CI \u20104.04 to 6.84; 30 participants). Sixty\u2010five percent of the participants with anti\u2010VEGF medications achieved IOP \u2264 21 mmHg, versus 60% without anti\u2010VEGF medications. In another trial, those who received anti\u2010VEGF medications were more likely to reduce their IOP than those who did not receive them, at one month (MD \u20106.50 mmHg, 95% CI \u20107.93 to \u20105.07; 40 participants), and at one year (MD \u201012.00 mmHg, 95% CI \u201016.79 to \u20107.21; 40 participants). Ninety\u2010five percent of the participants with anti\u2010VEGF medications achieved IOP \u2264 21 mmHg, versus 50% without anti\u2010VEGF medications. The certainty of a body of evidence was low for this outcome due to limitations in the design and inconsistency of results between studies. \nPost\u2010operative complications included anterior chamber bleeding (3 eyes) and conjunctival hemorrhage (2 participants) in the anti\u2010VEGF medications group, and retinal detachment and phthisis bulbi (1 participant each) in the control group. The certainty of evidence is low due to imprecision of results and indirectness of evidence. \nNo trial reported the proportion of participants with improvement in visual acuity, proportion of participants with complete regression of new iris vessels, or the proportion of participants with relief of pain and resolution of redness at four\u2010 to six\u2010week, or one\u2010year follow\u2010up. \nAuthors' conclusions\nCurrently available evidence is uncertain regarding the long\u2010term effectiveness of anti\u2010VEGF medications, such as intravitreal ranibizumab or bevacizumab or aflibercept, as an adjunct to conventional treatment in lowering IOP in NVG. More research is needed to investigate the long\u2010term effect of these medications compared with, or in addition to, conventional surgical or medical treatment in lowering IOP in NVG. \n", "10.1002-14651858.CD010461.pub3-abstract.txt": "Background\nAssisted reproductive technologies (ART) including in vitro fertilisation (IVF) and intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI), combine gametes to enhance the probability of fertilisation and pregnancy. Advanced sperm selection techniques are increasingly employed in ART, most commonly in cycles utilising ICSI. Advanced sperm selection techniques are proposed to improve the chance that structurally intact and mature sperm with high DNA integrity are selected for fertilisation. Strategies include selection according to surface charge; sperm apoptosis; sperm birefringence; ability to bind to hyaluronic acid; and sperm morphology under ultra\u2010high magnification. These techniques are intended to improve ART outcomes. \nObjectives\nTo evaluate the effectiveness and safety of advanced sperm selection techniques on ART outcomes. \nSearch methods\nWe conducted a systematic search of electronic databases (Cochrane Gynaecology and Fertility Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL via the Cochrane Register of Studies Online, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL); trials registers (ClinicalTrials.gov, Current Controlled Trials, and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform); conference abstracts (Web of Knowledge); and grey literature (OpenGrey) for relevant randomised controlled trials (RCTs). We handsearched the reference lists of included studies and similar reviews. The search was conducted in June 2018. \nSelection criteria\nWe included RCTs comparing advanced sperm selection techniques versus standard IVF, ICSI, or another technique. We excluded studies of intracytoplasmic morphologically selected sperm injection (IMSI), as they are subject to a separate Cochrane Review. Primary outcomes measured were live birth and miscarriage per woman randomly assigned. Secondary outcome measures included clinical pregnancy per woman randomly assigned. Secondary adverse events measured included miscarriage per clinical pregnancy and foetal abnormality. \nData collection and analysis\nTwo review authors independently assessed study eligibility and risk of bias and extracted data. Any disagreements were resolved by consultation with a third review author. We consulted study investigators to resolve queries. Risk ratios (RRs) were calculated with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We combined studies using a fixed\u2010effect model. We evaluated the quality of the evidence using GRADE methods. \nMain results\nWe included eight RCTs (4147 women). The quality of evidence ranged from very low to low. The main limitations were imprecision, performance bias, and attrition bias. \nHyaluronic acid selected sperm\u2010intracytoplasmic sperm injection (HA\u2010ICSI) compared to ICSI \nTwo RCTs compared the effects of HA\u2010ICSI versus ICSI on live birth. The quality of the evidence was low. There may be little or no difference between groups: 25% chance of live birth with ICSI versus 24.5% to 31% with HA\u2010ICSI (RR 1.09, 95% CI 0.97 to 1.23, 2903 women, I2 = 0%, low\u2010quality evidence). Three RCTs reported on miscarriage. HA\u2010ICSI may decrease miscarriage per woman randomly assigned: 7% chance of miscarriage with ICSI versus 3% to 6% chance with HA\u2010ICSI (RR 0.61, 95% CI 0.45 to 0.83, 3005 women, I2 = 0%, low\u2010quality evidence) and per clinical pregnancy: 20% chance of miscarriage with ICSI compared to 9% to 16% chance with HA\u2010ICSI (RR 0.62, 95% CI 0.46 to 0.82, 1065 women, I2 = 0%, low\u2010quality evidence). Four RCTs reported on clinical pregnancy. There may be little or no difference between groups: 37% chance of pregnancy with ICSI versus 34% to 40% chance with HA\u2010ICSI (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.09, 3492 women, I2 = 0%, low\u2010quality evidence). \nHA\u2010ICSI compared to SpermSlow \nOne RCT compared HA\u2010ICSI to SpermSlow. The quality of the evidence was very low. We are uncertain whether HA\u2010ICSI improves live birth compared to SpermSlow (RR 1.13, 95% CI 0.64 to 2.01, 100 women) or clinical pregnancy (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.66 to 1.68, 100 women). We are uncertain whether HA\u2010ICSI reduces miscarriage per woman (RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.23 to 2.81, 100 women) or per clinical pregnancy (RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.24 to 2.44, 41 women). \nMagnetic\u2010activated cell sorting (MACS) compared to ICSI \nOne RCT compared MACS to ICSI for live birth; three reported clinical pregnancy; and two reported miscarriage. The quality of the evidence was very low. We are uncertain whether MACS improves live birth (RR 1.95, 95% CI 0.89 to 4.29, 62 women) or clinical pregnancy (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.31, 413 women, I2 = 81%). We are also uncertain if MACS reduces miscarriage per woman (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.16 to 5.63, 150 women, I2 = 0%) or per clinical pregnancy (RR 0.51, 95%CI 0.09 to 2.82, 53 women, I2=0) \nZeta sperm selection compared to ICSI \nOne RCT evaluated Zeta sperm selection.

We are uncertain of the effect of Zeta sperm selection on live birth (RR 2.48, 95% CI 1.34 to 4.56, 203 women) or clinical pregnancy (RR 1.82, 95% CI 1.20 to 2.75, 203 women). We are also uncertain if Zeta sperm selection reduces miscarriage per woman (RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.16 to 3.37, 203 women) or per clinical pregnancy (RR 0.41, 95% CI 0.10 to 1.68, 1 RCT, 62 women). \nMACS compared to HA\u2010ICSI \nOne RCT compared MACS to HA\u2010ICSI. This study did not report on live birth. The quality of the evidence was very low. We are uncertain of the effect on miscarriage per woman (RR 1.52, 95% CI 0.10 to 23.35, 78 women) or per clinical pregnancy (RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.07 to 15.64, 37 women). We are also uncertain of the effect on clinical pregnancy (RR 1.44, 95% CI 0.91 to 2.27, 78 women). \nAuthors' conclusions\nThe evidence suggests that sperm selected by hyaluronic acid binding may have little or no effect on live birth or clinical pregnancy but may reduce miscarriage. We are uncertain of the effect of Zeta sperm selection on live birth, clinical pregnancy, and miscarriage due principally to the very low quality of the evidence for this intervention. We are uncertain of the effect of the other selection techniques on live birth, miscarriage, or pregnancy. \nFurther high\u2010quality studies, including the awaited data from the identified ongoing studies, are required to evaluate whether any of these advanced sperm selection techniques can be recommended for use in routine practice. \n", "10.1002-14651858.CD011723.pub2-abstract.txt": "Background\nSubstance use disorders (SUDs) are highly prevalent and associated with a substantial public health burden. Although evidence\u2010based interventions exist for treating SUDs, many individuals remain symptomatic despite treatment, and relapse is common.Mindfulness\u2010based interventions (MBIs) have been examined for the treatment of SUDs, but available evidence is mixed. \nObjectives\nTo determine the effects of MBIs for SUDs in terms of substance use outcomes, craving and adverse events compared to standard care, further psychotherapeutic, psychosocial or pharmacological interventions, or instructions, waiting list and no treatment. \nSearch methods\nWe searched the following databases up to April 2021: Cochrane Drugs and Alcohol Specialised Register, CENTRAL, PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, CINAHL and PsycINFO. We searched two trial registries and checked the reference lists of included studies for relevant randomized controlled trials (RCTs). \nSelection criteria\nRCTs testing a MBI versus no treatment or another treatment in individuals with SUDs. SUDs included alcohol and/or drug use disorders but excluded tobacco use disorders. MBIs were defined as interventions including training in mindfulness meditation with repeated meditation practice. Studies in which SUDs were formally diagnosed as well as those merely demonstrating elevated SUD risk were eligible. \nData collection and analysis\nWe used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane.\nMain results\nForty RCTs met our inclusion criteria, with 35 RCTs involving 2825 participants eligible for meta\u2010analysis. All studies were at high risk of performance bias and most were at high risk of detection bias. \nMindfulness\u2010based interventions (MBIs) versus no treatment \nTwenty\u2010four RCTs included a comparison between MBI and no treatment. The evidence was uncertain about the effects of MBIs relative to no treatment on all primary outcomes: continuous abstinence rate (post: risk ratio (RR) = 0.96, 95% CI 0.44 to 2.14, 1 RCT, 112 participants; follow\u2010up: RR = 1.04, 95% CI 0.54 to 2.01, 1 RCT, 112 participants); percentage of days with substance use (post\u2010treatment: standardized mean difference (SMD) = 0.05, 95% CI \u20100.37 to 0.47, 4 RCTs, 248 participants; follow\u2010up: SMD = 0.21, 95% CI \u20100.12 to 0.54, 3 RCTs, 167 participants); and consumed amount (post\u2010treatment: SMD = 0.10, 95% CI \u20100.31 to 0.52, 3 RCTs, 221 participants; follow\u2010up: SMD = 0.33, 95% CI 0.00 to 0.66, 2 RCTs, 142 participants). Evidence was uncertain for craving intensity and serious adverse events. Analysis of treatment acceptability indicated MBIs result in little to no increase in study attrition relative to no treatment (RR = 1.04, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.40, 21 RCTs, 1087 participants). Certainty of evidence for all other outcomes was very low due to imprecision, risk of bias, and/or inconsistency. Data were unavailable to evaluate adverse events. \nMindfulness\u2010based interventions (MBIs) versus other treatments (standard of care, cognitive behavioral therapy, psychoeducation, support group, physical exercise, medication) \nNineteen RCTs included a comparison between MBI and another treatment. The evidence was very uncertain about the effects of MBIs relative to other treatments on continuous abstinence rate at post\u2010treatment (RR = 0.80, 95% CI 0.45 to 1.44, 1 RCT, 286 participants) and follow\u2010up (RR = 0.57, 95% CI 0.28 to 1.16, 1 RCT, 286 participants), and on consumed amount at post\u2010treatment (SMD = \u20100.42, 95% CI \u20101.23 to 0.39, 1 RCT, 25 participants) due to imprecision and risk of bias. The evidence suggests that MBIs reduce percentage of days with substance use slightly relative to other treatments at post\u2010treatment (SMD = \u20100.21, 95% CI \u20100.45 to 0.03, 5 RCTs, 523 participants) and follow\u2010up (SMD = \u20100.39, 95% CI \u20100.96 to 0.17, 3 RCTs, 409 participants). The evidence was very uncertain about the effects of MBIs relative to other treatments on craving intensity due to imprecision and inconsistency. Analysis of treatment acceptability indicated MBIs result in little to no increase in attrition relative to other treatments (RR = 1.06, 95% CI 0.89 to 1.26, 14 RCTs, 1531 participants). Data were unavailable to evaluate adverse events. \nAuthors' conclusions\nIn comparison with no treatment, the evidence is uncertain regarding the impact of MBIs on SUD\u2010related outcomes. MBIs result in little to no higher attrition than no treatment. In comparison with other treatments, MBIs may slightly reduce days with substance use at post\u2010treatment and follow\u2010up (4 to 10 months). The evidence is uncertain regarding the impact of MBIs relative to other treatments on abstinence, consumed substance amount, or craving.

Few treatments are safe and effective. \nObjectives\nTo assess the effects of acupuncture for treating peripheral joint osteoarthritis.\nSearch methods\nWe searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library 2008, Issue 1), MEDLINE, and EMBASE (both through December 2007), and scanned reference lists of articles. \nSelection criteria\nRandomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing needle acupuncture with a sham, another active treatment, or a waiting list control group in people with osteoarthritis of the knee, hip, or hand. \nData collection and analysis\nTwo authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. We contacted study authors for additional information. We calculated standardized mean differences using the differences in improvements between groups. \nMain results\nSixteen trials involving 3498 people were included. Twelve of the RCTs included only people with OA of the knee, 3 only OA of the hip, and 1 a mix of people with OA of the hip and/or knee. In comparison with a sham control, acupuncture showed statistically significant, short\u2010term improvements in osteoarthritis pain (standardized mean difference \u20100.28, 95% confidence interval \u20100.45 to \u20100.11; 0.9 point greater improvement than sham on 20 point scale; absolute percent change 4.59%; relative percent change 10.32%; 9 trials; 1835 participants) and function (\u20100.28, \u20100.46 to \u20100.09; 2.7 point greater improvement on 68 point scale; absolute percent change 3.97%; relative percent change 8.63%); however, these pooled short\u2010term benefits did not meet our predefined thresholds for clinical relevance (i.e. 1.3 points for pain; 3.57 points for function) and there was substantial statistical heterogeneity. Additionally, restriction to sham\u2010controlled trials using shams judged most likely to adequately blind participants to treatment assignment (which were also the same shams judged most likely to have physiological activity), reduced heterogeneity and resulted in pooled short\u2010term benefits of acupuncture that were smaller and non\u2010significant. In comparison with sham acupuncture at the six\u2010month follow\u2010up, acupuncture showed borderline statistically significant, clinically irrelevant improvements in osteoarthritis pain (\u20100.10, \u20100.21 to 0.01; 0.4 point greater improvement than sham on 20 point scale; absolute percent change 1.81%; relative percent change 4.06%; 4 trials;1399 participants) and function (\u20100.11, \u20100.22 to 0.00; 1.2 point greater improvement than sham on 68 point scale; absolute percent change 1.79%; relative percent change 3.89%).

In the head\u2010on comparisons of acupuncture with the 'supervised osteoarthritis education' and the 'physician consultation' control groups, acupuncture was associated with clinically relevant short\u2010 and long\u2010term improvements in pain and function. In the head on comparisons of acupuncture with 'home exercises/advice leaflet' and 'supervised exercise', acupuncture was associated with similar treatment effects as the controls. Acupuncture as an adjuvant to an exercise based physiotherapy program did not result in any greater improvements than the exercise program alone. Information on safety was reported in only 8 trials and even in these trials there was limited reporting and heterogeneous methods. \nAuthors' conclusions\nSham\u2010controlled trials show statistically significant benefits; however, these benefits are small, do not meet our pre\u2010defined thresholds for clinical relevance, and are probably due at least partially to placebo effects from incomplete blinding. Waiting list\u2010controlled trials of acupuncture for peripheral joint osteoarthritis suggest statistically significant and clinically relevant benefits, much of which may be due to expectation or placebo effects. \n", "10.1002-14651858.CD008215.pub3-abstract.txt": "Background\nThis is an updated version of the original Cochrane Review published in the Cochrane Library in 2013 (Issue 8) on the risk of ovarian cancer in women using infertility drugs when compared to the general population or to infertile women not treated. The link between fertility drugs and ovarian cancer remains controversial. \nObjectives\nTo evaluate the risk of invasive ovarian cancer and borderline ovarian tumours in women treated with ovarian stimulating drugs for subfertility. \nSearch methods\nThe original review included published and unpublished observational studies from 1990 to February 2013. For this update, we extended the searches from February 2013 to November 2018; we evaluated the quality of the included studies and judged the certainty of evidence by using the GRADE approach. We have reported the results in a Summary of findings table to present effect sizes across all outcome types. \nSelection criteria\nIn the original review and in this update, we searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and non\u2010randomised studies and case series including more than 30 participants. \nData collection and analysis\nAt least two review authors independently conducted eligibility and 'Risk of bias' assessments and extracted data. We grouped studies based on the fertility drug used for two outcomes: borderline ovarian tumours and invasive ovarian cancer. We conducted no meta\u2010analyses due to expected methodological and clinical heterogeneity. \nMain results\nWe included 13 case\u2010control and 24 cohort studies (an additional nine new cohort and two case\u2010control studies), which included a total of 4,684,724 women. \nTwo cohort studies reported an increased incidence of invasive ovarian cancer in exposed subfertile women compared with unexposed women. One reported a standardised incidence ratio (SIR) of 1.19 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.54 to 2.25) based on 17 cancer cases. The other cohort study reported a hazard ratio (HR) of 1.93 (95% CI 1.18 to 3.18), and this risk was increased in women remaining nulligravid after using clomiphene citrate (HR 2.49, 95% CI 1.30 to 4.78) versus multiparous women (HR 1.52, 95% CI 0.67 to 3.42) (very low\u2010certainty evidence). The slight increase in ovarian cancer risk among women having between one and three cycles of in vitro fertilisation (IVF) was reported, but this was not clinically significant (P = 0.18). There was no increase in risk of invasive ovarian cancer after use of infertility drugs in women with the BRCA mutation according to one cohort and one case\u2010control study. The certainty of evidence as assessed using GRADE was very low. \nFor borderline ovarian tumours, one cohort study reported increased risk in exposed women with an SIR of 3.61 (95% CI 1.45 to 7.44), and this risk was greater after treatment with clomiphene citrate (SIR 7.47, 95% CI 1.54 to 21.83) based on 12 cases. In another cohort study, the risk of a borderline ovarian tumour was increased, with an HR of 4.23 (95% CI 1.25 to 14.33), for subfertile women treated with IVF compared with a non\u2010IVF\u2010treated group with more than one year of follow\u2010up. A large cohort reported increased risk of borderline ovarian tumours, with HR of 2.46 (95% CI 1.20 to 5.04), and this was based on 17 cases. A significant increase in serous borderline ovarian tumours was reported in one cohort study after the use of progesterone for more than four cycles (risk ratio (RR) 2.63, 95% CI 1.04 to 6.64). A case\u2010control study reported increased risk after clomiphene citrate was taken, with an SIR of 2.5 (95% CI 1.3 to 4.5) based on 11 cases, and another reported an increase especially after human menopausal gonadotrophin was taken (odds ratio (OR) 9.38, 95% CI 1.66 to 52.08). Another study estimated an increased risk of borderline ovarian tumour, but this estimation was based on four cases with no control reporting use of fertility drugs. The certainty of evidence as assessed using GRADE was very low. \nHowever, although some studies suggested a slight increase in risks of ovarian cancer and borderline ovarian tumour, none provided moderate\u2010 or high\u2010certainty evidence, as summarised in the GRADE tables. \nAuthors' conclusions\nSince the last version of this review, only a few new relevant studies have provided additional findings with supporting evidence to suggest that infertility drugs may increase the risk of ovarian cancer slightly in subfertile women treated with infertility drugs when compared to the general population or to subfertile women not treated. The risk is slightly higher in nulliparous than in multiparous women treated with infertility drugs, and for borderline ovarian tumours. However, few studies have been conducted, the number of cancers is very small, and information on the dose or type of fertility drugs used is insufficient. \n", "10.1002-14651858.CD011960.pub2-abstract.txt": "Background\nAcute myeloid leukaemia (AML) is the most common acute leukaemia affecting adults. Most patients diagnosed with AML are at advanced age and present with co\u2010morbidities, so that intensive therapy such as stem cell transplantation (SCT) is impossible to provide or is accompanied by high risks for serious adverse events and treatment\u2010related mortality. Especially for these patients, it is necessary to find out whether all\u2010trans retinoic acid (ATRA), an intermediate of vitamin A inducing terminal differentiation of leukaemic cell lines, added to chemotherapy confers increased benefit or harm when compared with the same chemotherapy alone. \nObjectives\nThis review aims to determine benefits and harms of ATRA in addition to chemotherapy compared to chemotherapy alone for adults with AML (not those with acute promyelocytic leukaemia (non\u2010APL)). \nSearch methods\nWe searched the Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, study registries and relevant conference proceedings up to July 2018 for randomised controlled trials (RCTs). We also contacted experts for unpublished data. \nSelection criteria\nWe included RCTs comparing chemotherapy alone with chemotherapy plus ATRA in patients with all stages of AML. We excluded trials if less than 80% of participants were adults or participants with AML, and if no subgroup data were available. Patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) were included, if they had a refractory anaemia and more than 20% of blasts. \nData collection and analysis\nTwo review authors independently extracted data and assessed the quality of trials. We contacted study authors to obtain missing information. We used hazard ratios (HR) for overall survival (OS) and disease\u2010free survival (DFS; instead of the pre\u2010planned event\u2010free survival, as this outcome was not reported), and we calculated risk ratios (RR) for the other outcomes quality of life, on\u2010study mortality and adverse events. We presented all measures with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We assessed the certainty of evidence using GRADE methods. \nMain results\nOur search resulted in 2192 potentially relevant references, of which we included eight trials with 28 publications assessing 3998 patients. Overall, we judged the potential risk of bias of the eight included trials as moderate. Two of eight trials were published as abstracts only. All the included trials used different chemotherapy schedules and one trial only evaluated the effect of the hypomethylating agent decitabine, a drug know to affect epigenetics, in combination with ATRA. \nThe addition of ATRA to chemotherapy resulted in probably little or no difference in OS compared to chemotherapy only (2985 participants; HR 0.94 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.87 to 1.02); moderate\u2010certainty evidence). Based on a mortality rate at 24 months of 70% with chemotherapy alone, the mortality rate with chemotherapy plus ATRA was 68% (95% CI 65% to 71%). \nFor DFS, complete response rate (CRR) and on\u2010study mortality there was probably little or no difference between treatment groups (DFS: 1258 participants, HR 0.99, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.12; CRR: 3081 participants, RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.09; on\u2010study mortality: 2839 participants, RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.30, all moderate\u2010certainty evidence). \nThree trials with 1428 participants reported the adverse events 'infection' and 'cardiac toxicity': There was probably no, or little difference in terms of infection rate between participants receiving ATRA or not (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.15; moderate\u2010certainty evidence). We are uncertain whether ATRA decreases cardiac toxicity (RR 0.46, 95% CI 0.24 to 0.90; P = 0.02, very low certainty\u2010evidence, however, cardiac toxicity was low).  Rates and severity of diarrhoea and nausea/vomiting were assessed in two trials with 337 patients and we are uncertain whether there is a difference between treatment arms (diarrhoea: RR 2.19, 95% CI 1.07 to 4.47; nausea/vomiting: RR 1.46, 95% CI 0.75 to 2.85; both very low\u2010certainty evidence). \nQuality of life was not reported by any of the included trials.\nAuthors' conclusions\nWe found no evidence for a difference between participants receiving ATRA in addition to chemotherapy or chemotherapy only for the outcome OS. Regarding DFS, CRR and on\u2010study mortality, there is probably no evidence for a difference between treatment groups. Currently, it seems the risk of adverse events are comparable to chemotherapy only. \nAs quality of life has not been evaluated in any of the included trials, further research is needed to clarify the effect of ATRA on quality of life. \n", "10.1002-14651858.CD013069.pub2-abstract.txt": "Background\nCognitive impairment, a defining feature of dementia, plays an important role in the compromised functional independence that characterises the condition.

ALOIS contains records of clinical trials identified through monthly searches of several major healthcare databases and numerous trial registries and grey literature sources. In addition to this, we searched MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL, LILACS, Web of Science Core Collection, ClinicalTrials.gov, and the World Health Organization's trials portal, ICTRP, to ensure that searches were comprehensive and up\u2010to\u2010date. \nSelection criteria\nWe included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that described interventions for people with mild to moderate dementia and compared CT versus a control or alternative intervention. \nData collection and analysis\nWe extracted relevant data from published manuscripts and through contact with trial authors if required. We assessed risk of bias using the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' tool. We divided comparison conditions into active or passive control conditions and alternative treatments. We used a large number of measures and data to evaluate 19 outcomes at end of treatment, as well as 16 outcomes at follow\u2010up in the medium term; we pooled this information in meta\u2010analyses. We calculated pooled estimates of treatment effect using a random\u2010effects model, and we estimated statistical heterogeneity using a standard Chi\u00b2 statistic. We graded the evidence using GradePro. \nMain results\nThe 33 included trials were published between 1988 and 2018 and were conducted in 12 countries; most were unregistered, parallel\u2010group, single\u2010site RCTs, with samples ranging from 12 to 653 participants. Interventions were between two and 104 weeks long. We classified most experimental interventions as 'straight CT', but we classified some as 'augmented CT', and about two\u2010thirds as multi\u2010domain interventions. Researchers investigated 18 passive and 13 active control conditions, along with 15 alternative treatment conditions, including occupational therapy, mindfulness, reminiscence therapy, and others. \nThe methodological quality of studies varied, but we rated nearly all studies as having high or unclear risk of selection bias due to lack of allocation concealment, and high or unclear risk of performance bias due to lack of blinding of participants and personnel. \nWe used data from 32 studies in the meta\u2010analysis of at least one outcome. Relative to a control condition, we found moderate\u2010quality evidence showing a small to moderate effect of CT on our first primary outcome, composite measure of global cognition at end of treatment (standardised mean difference (SMD) 0.42, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.23 to 0.62), and high\u2010quality evidence showing a moderate effect on the secondary outcome of verbal semantic fluency (SMD 0.52, 95% CI 0.23 to 0.81) at end of treatment, with these gains retained in the medium term (3 to 12 months post treatment). In relation to many other outcomes, including our second primary outcome of clinical disease severity in the medium term, the quality of evidence was very low, so we were unable to determine whether CT was associated with any meaningful gains. \nWhen compared with an alternative treatment, we found that CT may have little to no effect on our first primary outcome of global cognition at end of treatment (SMD 0.21, 95% CI \u20100.23 to 0.64), but the quality of evidence was low. No evidence was available to assess our second primary outcome of clinical disease severity in the medium term. We found moderate\u2010quality evidence showing that CT was associated with improved mood of the caregiver at end of treatment, but this was based on a single trial. The quality of evidence in relation to many other outcomes at end of treatment and in the medium term was too low for us to determine whether CT was associated with any gains, but we are moderately confident that CT did not lead to any gains in mood, behavioural and psychological symptoms, or capacity to perform activities of daily living. \nAuthors' conclusions\nRelative to a control intervention, but not to a variety of alternative treatments, CT is probably associated with small to moderate positive effects on global cognition and verbal semantic fluency at end of treatment, and these benefits appear to be maintained in the medium term. Our certainty in relation to many of these findings is low or very low. Future studies should take stronger measures to mitigate well\u2010established risks of bias, and should provide long\u2010term follow\u2010up to improve our understanding of the extent to which observed gains are retained.

This is the second update of the review and includes two new studies and 4432 more participants. \nLocal recurrence\u2010free survival is probably slightly reduced (by 3/1000, 95% CI 6 fewer to 0 fewer) with the use of PBI/APBI compared to WBRT (hazard ratio (HR) 1.21, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.03 to 1.42; 8 studies, 13,168 participants; moderate\u2010certainty evidence). \nCosmesis (physician/nurse\u2010reported) is probably worse (by 63/1000, 95% CI 35 more to 92 more) with the use of PBI/APBI (odds ratio (OR) 1.57, 95% CI 1.31 to 1.87; 6 studies, 3652 participants; moderate\u2010certainty evidence). \nOverall survival is similar (0/1000 fewer, 95% CI 6 fewer to 6 more) with PBI/APBI and WBRT (HR 0.99, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.12; 8 studies, 13,175 participants; high\u2010certainty evidence). \nLate radiation toxicity (subcutaneous fibrosis) is probably increased (by 14/1000 more, 95% CI 102 more to 188 more) with PBI/APBI (OR 5.07, 95% CI 3.81 to 6.74; 2 studies, 3011 participants; moderate\u2010certainty evidence). \nThe use of PBI/APBI probably makes little difference (1/1000 less, 95% CI 6 fewer to 3 more) to cause\u2010specific survival (HR 1.06, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.36; 7 studies, 9865 participants; moderate\u2010certainty evidence). \nWe found the use of PBI/APBI compared with WBRT probably makes little or no difference (1/1000 fewer (95% CI 4 fewer to 6 more)) to distant metastasis\u2010free survival (HR 0.95, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.13; 7 studies, 11,033 participants; moderate\u2010certainty evidence). \nWe found the use of PBI/APBI in comparison with WBRT makes little or no difference (2/1000 fewer, 95% CI 20 fewer to 20 more) to mastectomy rates (OR 0.98, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.23; 3 studies, 3740 participants, high\u2010certainty evidence). \nAuthors' conclusions\nIt appeared that local recurrence\u2010free survival is probably worse with PBI/APBI; however, the difference was small and nearly all women remain free of local recurrence. Overall survival is similar with PBI/APBI and WBRT, and we found little to no difference in other oncological outcomes. Some late effects (subcutaneous fibrosis) may be worse with PBI/APBI and its use is probably associated with worse cosmetic outcomes. The limitations of the data currently available mean that we cannot make definitive conclusions about the efficacy and safety or ways to deliver PBI/APBI. We await completion of ongoing trials. \n", "10.1002-14651858.CD004418.pub4-abstract.txt": "Background\nCommunity\u2010acquired pneumonia (CAP) is caused by various pathogens, traditionally divided into 'typical' and 'atypical'. Initial antibiotic treatment of CAP is usually empirical, customarily covering both typical and atypical pathogens. To date, no sufficient evidence exists to support this broad coverage, while limiting coverage is bound to reduce toxicity, resistance and expense. \nObjectives\nThe main objective was to estimate the mortality and proportion with treatment failure using regimens containing atypical antibiotic coverage compared to those that had typical coverage only. Secondary objectives included the assessment of adverse events. \nSearch methods\nWe searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) Issue 3, 2012 which includes the Acute Respiratory Infection Group's Specialized Register, MEDLINE (January 1966 to April week 1, 2012) and EMBASE (January 1980 to April 2012). \nSelection criteria\nRandomized controlled trials (RCTs) of adult patients hospitalized due to CAP, comparing antibiotic regimens with atypical coverage (quinolones, macrolides, tetracyclines, chloramphenicol, streptogramins or ketolides) to a regimen without atypical antibiotic coverage. \nData collection and analysis\nTwo review authors independently assessed the risk of bias and extracted data from included trials. We estimated risk ratios (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We assessed heterogeneity using a Chi2 test. \nMain results\nWe included 28 trials, encompassing 5939 randomized patients. The atypical antibiotic was administered as monotherapy in all but three studies. Only one study assessed a beta\u2010lactam combined with a macrolide compared to the same beta\u2010lactam. There was no difference in mortality between the atypical arm and the non\u2010atypical arm (RR 1.14; 95% CI 0.84 to 1.55), RR < 1 favors the atypical arm. The atypical arm showed an insignificant trend toward clinical success and a significant advantage to bacteriological eradication, which disappeared when evaluating methodologically high quality studies alone. Clinical success for the atypical arm was significantly higher for Legionella pneumophilae (L. pneumophilae) and non\u2010significantly lower for pneumococcal pneumonia. There was no significant difference between the groups in the frequency of (total) adverse events, or those requiring discontinuation of treatment. However, gastrointestinal events were less common in the atypical arm (RR 0.70; 95% CI 0.53 to 0.92). Although the trials assessed different antibiotics, no significant heterogeneity was detected in the analyses. \nAuthors' conclusions\nNo benefit of survival or clinical efficacy was shown with empirical atypical coverage in hospitalized patients with CAP. This conclusion relates mostly to the comparison of quinolone monotherapy to beta\u2010lactams. Further trials, comparing beta\u2010lactam monotherapy to the same combined with a macrolide, should be performed. \n", "10.1002-14651858.CD011681-abstract.txt": "Background\nThis is an updated version of the Cochrane review published in 2005 on selective serotonin re\u2010uptake inhibitors (SSRIs) for preventing migraine and tension\u2010type headache. The original review has been split in two parts and this review now only regards tension\u2010type headache prevention. Another updated review covers migraine. Tension\u2010type headache is the second most common disorder worldwide and has high social and economic relevance. As serotonin and other neurotransmitters may have a role in pain mechanisms, SSRIs and serotonin\u2010norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) have been evaluated for the prevention of tension\u2010type headache. \nObjectives\nTo determine the efficacy and tolerability of SSRIs and SNRIs compared to placebo and other active interventions in the prevention of episodic and chronic tension\u2010type headache in adults. \nSearch methods\nFor the original review, we searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL 2003, Issue 4), MEDLINE (1966 to January 2004), EMBASE (1994 to May 2003), and Headache Quarterly (1990 to 2003). For this update, we revised the original search strategy to reflect the broader type of intervention (SSRIs and SNRIs). We searched CENTRAL (2014, Issue 10) on the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE (1946 to November 2014), EMBASE (1980 to November 2014), and PsycINFO (1987 to November 2014). We also checked the reference lists of retrieved articles and searched trial registries for ongoing trials. \nSelection criteria\nWe included randomised controlled trials comparing SSRIs or SNRIs with any type of control intervention in participants 18 years and older, of either sex, with tension\u2010type headache. \nData collection and analysis\nTwo authors independently extracted data (headache frequency, index, intensity, and duration; use of symptomatic/analgesic medication; quality of life; and withdrawals) and assessed the risk of bias of trials. The primary outcome is tension\u2010type headache frequency, measured by the number of headache attacks or the number of days with headache per evaluation period. \nMain results\nThe original review included six studies on tension\u2010type headache. We now include eight studies with a total of 412 participants with chronic forms of tension\u2010type headache. These studies evaluated five SSRIs (citalopram, sertraline, fluoxetine, paroxetine, fluvoxamine) and one SNRI (venlafaxine). The two new studies included in this update are placebo controlled trials, one evaluated sertraline and one venlafaxine. Six studies, already included in the previous version of this review, compared SSRIs to other antidepressants (amitriptyline, desipramine, sulpiride, mianserin). Most of the included studies had methodological and/or reporting shortcomings and lacked adequate power. Follow\u2010up ranged between two and four months. \nSix studies explored the effect of SSRIs or SNRIs on tension\u2010type headache frequency, the primary endpoint. At eight weeks of follow\u2010up, we found no difference when compared to placebo (two studies, N = 127; mean difference (MD) \u20100.96, 95% confidence interval (CI) \u20103.95 to 2.03; I2= 0%) or amitriptyline (two studies, N = 152; MD 0.76, 95% CI \u20102.05 to 3.57; I2= 44%). \nWhen considering secondary outcomes, SSRIs reduce the symptomatic/analgesic medication use for acute headache attacks compared to placebo (two studies, N = 118; MD \u20101.87, 95% CI \u20102.09 to \u20101.65; I2= 0%). However, amitriptyline appeared to reduce the intake of analgesic more efficiently than SSRIs (MD 4.98, 95% CI 1.12 to 8.84; I2= 0%). The studies supporting these findings were considered at unclear risk of bias. We found no differences compared to placebo or other antidepressants in headache duration and intensity. \nSSRIs or SNRI were generally more tolerable than tricyclics. However, the two groups did not differ in terms of number of participants who withdrew due to adverse events or for other reasons (four studies, N = 257; odds ratio (OR) 1.04; 95% CI 0.41 to 2.60; I2= 25% and OR 1.55, 95% CI 0.71 to 3.38; I2= 0%). \nWe did not find any study comparing SSRIs or SNRIs with pharmacological treatments other than antidepressants (e.g. botulinum toxin) or non\u2010drug therapies (e.g. psycho\u2010behavioural treatments, manual therapy, acupuncture). \nAuthors' conclusions\nSince the last version of this review, the new included studies have not added high quality evidence to support the use of SSRIs or venlafaxine (a SNRI) as preventive drugs for tension\u2010type headache. Over two months of treatment, SSRIs or venlafaxine are no more effective than placebo or amitriptyline in reducing headache frequency in patients with chronic tension\u2010type headache. SSRIs seem to be less effective than tricyclic antidepressants in terms of intake of analgesic medications. Tricyclic antidepressants are associated with more adverse events; however, this did not cause a greater number of withdrawals. No reliable information is available at longer follow\u2010up. Our conclusion is that the use of SSRIs and venlafaxine for the prevention of chronic tension\u2010type headache is not supported by evidence. \n", "10.1002-14651858.CD009949.pub2-abstract.txt": "Background\nRadial head fracture is the most common fracture of the elbow. It usually results from a fall onto an outstretched arm. In 1954, Mason classified these fractures into type 1 (undisplaced), type 2 (simple displaced), and type 3 (comminuted fractures). Aspiration of the elbow joint aims to relieve pressure in the elbow joint and has been used as an initial treatment option for radial head fractures. However, it is an invasive technique with the potential for complications such as infection and injury to nerves and vessels. \nObjectives\nTo assess the effects (benefits and harms) of elbow joint aspiration for treating radial head fracture in adults. \nSearch methods\nWe searched the Cochrane Bone, Joint and Muscle Trauma Group Specialised Register (14 April 2014), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (14 April 2014), MEDLINE (1946 to April Week 1 2014) and EMBASE (1980 to 2014 Week 15), trial registries, bibliographies and conference proceedings. \nSelection criteria\nRandomised and quasi\u2010randomised controlled clinical trials comparing aspiration versus no aspiration for treating radial head fractures in adults. \nData collection and analysis\nTwo review authors independently selected articles, assessed risk of bias and extracted data. Disagreements were resolved by discussion. Where appropriate, we pooled results of comparable studies using fixed\u2010effect meta\u2010analysis. \nMain results\nWe included two trials that involved 126 participants but provided results for only 108 participants. Most participants were adults, typically over 30 years of age. Both trials were at high risk of selection, performance, detection and reporting bias. Reflecting this high risk of bias, we downgraded the quality of evidence two levels for study limitations and a further level for imprecision. Thus we judged the evidence for all outcomes to be 'very low' quality, meaning that we are very uncertain about these estimates. \nOne trial included participants with Mason type 1, 2 or 3 radial head fractures and also a few cases of traumatic elbow hemarthrosis without fracture. The other trial included participants with Mason type 1 and 2 fractures. All participants were managed non\u2010surgically. \nNeither trial reported functional outcome based on validated patient\u2010reported outcome measures of function or pain using validated measures such as a visual analogue scale. Very low quality evidence (108 participants, two trials) indicates little difference between aspiration and no aspiration in impaired function (unable to carry heavy loads; discomfort when carrying loads) at 12 months (9/51 in aspiration group versus 7/57 in the no aspiration group; risk ratio 1.43 favouring no aspiration, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.57 to 3.58). Very low quality evidence (two trials) suggests a beneficial effect of aspiration on pain relief immediately after aspiration. Very low quality evidence (one trial, 28 participants) shows less pain after aspiration at three weeks, but it is unclear whether this applies subsequently. Neither trial reported on adverse events (for example, nerve and vascular injuries; deep or superficial infection) from the procedure, but aspiration was reported as being unsuccessful in three participants (7.9%) in one trial. Very low quality evidence indicates little difference in range of motion (based on elbow extension) between the two groups at six weeks (28 participants, one trial) or 12 months (108 participants, two trials). The report of adverse events was incomplete, but one trial (80 participants) reported the absence of three specific complications: myositis ossificans, joint instability or late displacement of the fracture. \nAuthors' conclusions\nThere is insufficient evidence to determine the effectiveness of joint aspiration for the initial treatment of radial head fracture in terms of function, pain and range of motion or to determine the safety of the procedure. An examination of current aspiration use, the prospective collection of adverse events and consultation with patients as to their preferences and values would be helpful in guiding decisions about the future design of a multicentre randomised trial aiming to obtain definitive evidence on the use of aspiration for treating radial head fractures. \n", "10.1002-14651858.CD010709.pub2-abstract.txt": "Background\nGuidelines recommend routine arteriovenous (AV) graft and fistula surveillance (technology\u2010based screening) in addition to clinical monitoring (physical examination) for early identification and pre\u2010emptive correction of a stenosis before the access becomes dysfunctional. However, consequences on patient\u2010relevant outcomes of pre\u2010emptive correction of a stenosis in a functioning access as opposed to deferred correction, i.e. correction postponed to when the access becomes dysfunctional, are uncertain. \nObjectives\nWe aimed to evaluate 1) whether pre\u2010emptive correction of an AV access stenosis improves clinically relevant outcomes; 2) whether the effects of pre\u2010emptive correction of an AV access stenosis differ by access type (fistula versus graft), aim (primary and secondary prophylaxis), and surveillance method for primary prophylaxis (Doppler ultrasound for the screening of functional and anatomical changes versus measurement of the flow in the access); and 3) whether other factors (dialysis duration, access location, configuration or materials, algorithm for referral for intervention, intervention strategies (surgical versus radiological or other), or study design) explain the heterogeneity that might exist in the effect estimates. \nSearch methods\nWe searched the Cochrane Kidney and Transplant Specialised Register to 30 November 2015 using search terms relevant to this review. \nSelection criteria\nWe included all studies of any access surveillance method for early identification and pre\u2010emptive treatment of an AV access stenosis. \nData collection and analysis\nWe extracted data on potentially remediable and irremediable failure of the access (i.e. thrombosis and access loss respectively); infection and mortality; and resource use (hospitalisation, diagnostic and intervention procedures). Analysis was by a random effects model and results expressed as risk ratio (RR), hazard ratio (HR) or incidence rate ratio (IRR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). \nMain results\nWe identified 14 studies (1390 participants), nine enrolled adults without a known access stenosis (primary prophylaxis; three studies including people using fistulas) and five enrolled adults with a documented stenosis in a non\u2010dysfunctional access (secondary prophylaxis; three studies in people using fistulas). Study follow\u2010up ranged from 6 to 38 months, and study size ranged from 58 to 189 participants. In low\u2010 to moderate\u2010quality evidence (based on GRADE criteria) in adults treated with haemodialysis, relative to no surveillance and deferred correction, surveillance with pre\u2010emptive correction of an AV stenosis reduced the risk of thrombosis (RR 0.79, 95% CI 0.65 to 0.97; I\u00b2 = 30%; 18 study comparisons, 1212 participants), and probably improves the longevity of AV access (RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.64 to 0.99; I\u00b2 = 0%; 11 study comparisons, 972 participants). In analyses subgrouped by access type, pre\u2010emptive stenosis correction did not reduce the risk of thrombosis (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.8 to 1.12; I\u00b2 = 0%; 11 study comparisons, 697 participants) or access loss in grafts (RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.69 to 1.11; I\u00b2 = 0%; 7 study comparisons; 662 participants), but did reduce the risk of thrombosis (RR 0.5, 95% CI 0.35 to 0.71; I\u00b2 = 0%; 7 study comparisons, 515 participants) and the risk of access loss in fistulas (RR 0.5, 95% CI 0.29 to 0.86; I\u00b2 = 0%; 4 studies; 310 participants). Three of the four studies reporting access loss data in fistulas (199 participants) were conducted in the same centre. Insufficient data were available to assess whether benefits vary by prophylaxis aim in fistulas (i.e. primary and secondary prophylaxis). Although the magnitude of the effects of pre\u2010emptive stenosis correction was considerable for patient\u2010centred outcomes, results were either heterogeneous or imprecise. While pre\u2010emptive stenosis correction may reduce the rates of hospitalisation (IRR 0.54, 95% CI 0.31 to 0.93; I\u00b2 = 67%; 4 study comparisons, 219 participants) and use of catheters (IRR 0.58, 95% CI 0.35 to 0.98; I\u00b2 = 53%; 6 study comparisons, 394 participants), it may also increase the rates of diagnostic procedures (IRR 1.78, 95% CI 1.18 to 2.67; I\u00b2 = 62%; 7 study comparisons, 539 participants), infection (IRR 1.74, 95% CI 0.78 to 3.91; I\u00b2 = 0%; 3 studies, 248 participants) and mortality (RR 1.38, 95% CI 0.91 to 2.11; I\u00b2 = 0%; 5 studies, 386 participants). \nIn general, risk of bias was high or unclear in most studies for many domains we assessed. Four studies were published after 2005 and only one had evidence of registration within a trial registry. No study reported information on authorship and/or involvement of the study sponsor in data collection, analysis, and interpretation. \nAuthors' conclusions\nPre\u2010emptive correction of a newly identified or known stenosis in a functional AV access does not improve access longevity. Although pre\u2010emptive stenosis correction may be promising in fistulas existing evidence is insufficient to guide clinical practice and health policy. While pre\u2010emptive stenosis correction may reduce the risk of hospitalisation, this benefit is uncertain whereas there may be a substantial increase (i.e. 80%) in the use of access\u2010related procedures and procedure\u2010related adverse events (e.g. infection, mortality). The net effects of pre\u2010emptive correction on harms and resource use are thus unclear. \n", "10.1002-14651858.CD012470.pub2-abstract.txt": "Background\nWrist fractures, involving the distal radius, are the most common fractures in children. Most are buckle fractures, which are stable fractures, unlike greenstick and other usually displaced fractures. There is considerable variation in practice, such as the extent of immobilisation for buckle fractures and use of surgery for seriously displaced fractures. \nObjectives\nTo assess the effects (benefits and harms) of interventions for common distal radius fractures in children, including skeletally immature adolescents. \nSearch methods\nWe searched the Cochrane Bone, Joint and Muscle Trauma Group's Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, Embase, trial registries and reference lists to May 2018. \nSelection criteria\nWe included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi\u2010RCTs comparing interventions for treating distal radius fractures in children. We sought data on physical function, treatment failure, adverse events, time to return to normal activities (recovery time), wrist pain, and child (and parent) satisfaction. \nData collection and analysis\nAt least two review authors independently performed study screening and selection, 'Risk of bias' assessment and data extraction. We pooled data where appropriate and used GRADE for assessing the quality of evidence for each outcome. \nMain results\nOf the 30 included studies, 21 were RCTs, seven were quasi\u2010RCTs and two did not describe their randomisation method. Overall, 2930 children were recruited. Typically, trials included more male children and reported mean ages between 8 and 10 years. Eight studies recruited buckle fractures, five recruited buckle and other stable fractures, three recruited minimally displaced fractures and 14 recruited displaced fractures, typically requiring closed reduction, typically requiring closed reduction. All studies were at high risk of bias, mainly reflecting lack of blinding. The studies made 14 comparisons. Below we consider five prespecified comparisons: \nRemovable splint versus below\u2010elbow cast for predominantly buckle fractures (6 studies, 695 children) One study (66 children) reported similar Modified Activities Scale for Kids \u2010 Performance scores (0 to 100; no disability) at four weeks (median scores: splint 99.04; cast 99.11); low\u2010quality evidence. Thirteen children needed a change or reapplication of device (splint 5/225; cast 8/219; 4 studies); very low\u2010quality evidence. One study (87 children) reported no refractures at six months. One study (50 children) found no between\u2010group difference in pain during treatment; very low\u2010quality evidence. Evidence was absent (recovery time), insufficient (children with minor complications) or contradictory (child or parent satisfaction). Two studies estimated lower healthcare costs for removable splints. \nSoft or elasticated bandage versus below\u2010elbow cast for buckle or similar fractures (4 studies, 273 children) One study (53 children) reported more children had no or only limited disability at four weeks in the bandage group; very low\u2010quality evidence. Eight children changed device or extended immobilisation for delayed union (bandage 5/90; cast 3/91; 3 studies); very low\u2010quality evidence. Two studies (139 children) reported no serious adverse events at four weeks. Evidence was absent, insufficient or contradictory for recovery time, wrist pain, children with minor complications, and child and parent satisfaction. More bandage\u2010group participants found their treatment convenient (39 children). \nRemoval of casts at home by parents versus at the hospital fracture clinic by clinicians (2 studies, 404 children, mainly buckle fractures) \nOne study (233 children) found full restoration of physical function at four weeks; low\u2010quality evidence. There were five treatment changes (home 4/197; hospital 1/200; 2 studies; very low\u2010quality evidence). One study found no serious adverse effects at six months (288 children). Recovery time and number of children with minor complications were not reported. There was no evidence of a difference in pain at four weeks (233 children); low\u2010quality evidence. One study (80 children) found greater parental satisfaction in the home group; low\u2010quality evidence. One UK study found lower healthcare costs for home removal. \nBelow\u2010elbow versus above\u2010elbow casts for displaced or unstable both\u2010bone fractures (4 studies, 399 children) \nShort\u2010term physical function data were unavailable but very low\u2010quality evidence indicated less dependency when using below\u2010elbow casts. One study (66 children with minimally displaced both\u2010bone fractures) found little difference in ABILHAND\u2010Kids scores (0 to 42; no problems) (mean scores: below\u2010elbow 40.7; above\u2010elbow 41.8); very low\u2010quality evidence. Overall treatment failure data are unavailable, but nine of the 11 remanipulations or secondary reductions (366 children, 4 studies) were in the above\u2010elbow group; very low\u2010quality evidence. There was no refracture or compartment syndrome at six months (215 children; 2 studies). Recovery time and overall numbers of children with minor complications were not reported. There was little difference in requiring physiotherapy for stiffness (179 children, 2 studies); very low\u2010quality evidence. One study (85 children) found less pain at one week for below\u2010elbow casts; low\u2010quality evidence. One study found treatment with an above\u2010elbow cast cost three times more in Nepal. \nSurgical fixation with percutaneous wiring and cast immobilisation versus cast immobilisation alone after closed reduction of displaced fractures (5 studies, 323 children) \nWhere reported, above\u2010elbow casts were used. Short\u2010term functional outcome data were unavailable. One study (123 children) reported similar ABILHAND\u2010Kids scores indicating normal physical function at six months (mean scores: surgery 41.9; cast only 41.4); low\u2010quality evidence. There were fewer treatment failures, defined as early or problematic removal of wires or remanipulation for early loss in position, after surgery (surgery 20/124; cast only 41/129; 4 studies; very low\u2010quality evidence). Similarly, there were fewer serious advents after surgery (surgery 28/124; cast only 43/129; 4 studies; very low\u2010quality evidence). Recovery time, wrist pain, and satisfaction were not reported. There was lower referral for physiotherapy for stiffness after surgery (1 study); very low\u2010quality evidence. One USA study found similar treatment costs in both groups. \nAuthors' conclusions\nWhere available, the quality of the RCT\u2010based evidence on interventions for treating wrist fractures in children is low or very low. However, there is reassuring evidence of a full return to previous function with no serious adverse events, including refracture, for correctly\u2010diagnosed buckle fractures, whatever the treatment used. The review findings are consistent with the move away from cast immobilisation for these injuries. High\u2010quality evidence is needed to address key treatment uncertainties; notably, some priority topics are already being tested in ongoing multicentre trials, such as FORCE. \n", "10.1002-14651858.CD011931.pub2-abstract.txt": "Background\nPain following brain surgery can compromise recovery.

Dexmedetomidine may decrease additional analgesic requirements (MD \u221221.36 mg, 95% CI \u221234.63 to \u22128.1 mg, 2 studies, 128 participants, low\u2010quality evidence). Results for other outcomes were imprecise (nausea and vomiting RR \u22120.43, 95% CI 0.06 to 3.08, 3 studies, 261 participants; hypotension RR 0.5, 95% CI 0.05 to 5.28, 3 studies, 184 participants; both low\u2010quality evidence). \nScalp blocks may reduce pain up to 48 hours (0 to 6 hours, MD \u22120.98, 95% CI \u22121.66 to \u22120.3, 10 studies, 414 participants; 12 hours, MD \u22120.95, 95% CI \u22121.53 to \u22120.37, 8 studies, 294 participants; 24 hours, MD \u22120.78, 95% CI \u22121.52 to \u22120.05, 9 studies, 433 participants, all low\u2010quality evidence; 48 hours, MD \u22121.34, 95% CI \u22122.57 to \u22120.11, 4 studies, 135 participants, very low\u2010quality evidence. When studies with high risk of bias were excluded, significance remained at 12 hours only. Scalp blocks may decrease additional analgesia requirements (SMD \u22121.11, 95% CI \u22121.97 to \u22120.25, 7 studies, 314 participants). Results for other outcomes were imprecise (nausea and vomiting RR 0.66, 95% CI 0.33 to 1.32, 4 studies, 165 participants, very low\u2010quality evidence). \nScalp Infiltration may reduce pain postoperatively but efficacy was inconsistent, with a significant effect at 12 and 48 hours only (12 hours, MD \u22120.71, 95% CI \u22121.34 to \u22120.08, 7 studies, 309 participants, low\u2010quality evidence; 48 hours, MD \u2010 1.09, 95% CI \u20102.13 to \u2010 0.06, 3 studies, 128 participants, moderate\u2010quality evidence). No benefit was observed at other times (0 to 6 hours, MD \u22120.64, 95% CI \u22121.28 to \u22120.00, 9 studies, 475 participants, moderate\u2010quality evidence; 24 hours, MD \u22120.39, 95% CI \u22121.06 to 0.27,6 studies, 260 participants, low\u2010quality evidence. Scalp infiltration may reduce additional analgesia requirements MD \u22129.56 mg, 95% CI \u221215.64 to \u22123.49, 6 studies, 345 participants, very low\u2010quality evidence). When studies with high risk of bias were excluded, scalp infiltration lost the pain benefit at 12 hours and effects on additional analgesia requirements, but retained the pain\u2010reducing benefit at 48 hours (MD \u22120.56, 95% CI \u22121.20 to \u20100.32, 2 studies, 100 participants, very low\u2010quality evidence). Results for other outcomes were imprecise (nausea and vomiting, RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.48 to 1.41, 4 studies, 318 participants, low\u2010quality evidence). \nPregabalin or gabapentin may reduce pain up to 6 hours (2 studies, 202 participants), MD \u20101.15,95% CI \u22121.66 to \u22120.6, 2 studies, 202 participants, low\u2010quality evidence). One study examined analgesic efficacy at 12 hours showing significant benefit. No analgesia efficacy was shown at later times (24 hours, MD \u20100.29, 95% CI \u20100.78 to \u20100.19; 48 hours, MD \u2010 0.06, 95% CI \u20100.86 to 0.77, 2 studies, 202 participants, low\u2010quality evidence). Additional analgesia requirements were not significantly less (MD \u22120.37 (95% CI \u22121.10 to 0.35, 3 studies, 234 participants, low\u2010quality evidence). Risk of nausea and vomiting was significantly reduced (RR 0.51, 95% CI 0.29 to 0.89, 3 studies, 273 participants, low\u2010quality evidence). Results for other outcomes were imprecise (additional analgesia requirements: MD \u22120.37, 95% CI \u22121.10 to 0.35, 3 studies, 234 participants, low\u2010quality evidence). \nAcetaminophen did not show analgesic benefit (0 to 6 hours, MD \u22120.35, 95% CI \u22121.00 to 0.30; 12 hours, MD \u22120.51, 95% CI \u22121.04 to 0.03, 3 studies, 332 participants, moderate\u2010quality evidence; 24 hours, MD \u20100.34, 95% CI \u20101.20 to 0.52, 4 studies, 439 participants, high\u2010quality evidence). Results for other outcomes remained imprecise (additional analgesia requirements, MD 0.07, 95% CI \u22120.86 to 0.99, 4 studies, 459 participants, high\u2010quality evidence; length of hospitalizations, MD \u22123.71, 95% CI \u221214.12 to 6.7, 2 studies, 335 participants, moderate\u2010quality evidence). \nAuthors' conclusions\nThere is high\u2010quality evidence that NSAIDs reduce pain up to 24 hours postoperatively. The evidence for reductions in pain with dexmedetomidine, pregabalin or gabapentin, scalp blocks, and scalp infiltration is less certain and of very low to moderate quality. There is low\u2010quality evidence that scalp blocks and dexmedetomidine may reduce additional analgesics requirements. There is low\u2010quality evidence that gabapentin or pregabalin may decrease nausea and vomiting, with the caveat that the total number of events for this comparison was low. \n", "10.1002-14651858.CD006672.pub3-abstract.txt": "Background\nMost vaginal births are associated with trauma to the genital tract. The morbidity associated with perineal trauma can be significant, especially when it comes to third\u2010 and fourth\u2010degree tears. Different interventions including perineal massage, warm or cold compresses, and perineal management techniques have been used to prevent trauma. This is an update of a Cochrane review that was first published in 2011. \nObjectives\nTo assess the effect of perineal techniques during the second stage of labour on the incidence and morbidity associated with perineal trauma. \nSearch methods\nWe searched Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth's Trials Register (26 September 2016) and reference lists of retrieved studies. \nSelection criteria\nPublished and unpublished randomised and quasi\u2010randomised controlled trials evaluating perineal techniques during the second stage of labour. Cross\u2010over trials were not eligible for inclusion. \nData collection and analysis\nThree review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion, extracted data and evaluated methodological quality. We checked data for accuracy. \nMain results\nTwenty\u2010two trials were eligible for inclusion (with 20 trials involving 15,181 women providing data). Trials were at moderate to high risk of bias; none had adequate blinding, and most were unclear for both allocation concealment and incomplete outcome data. Interventions compared included the use of perineal massage, warm and cold compresses, and other perineal management techniques. \nMost studies did not report data on our secondary outcomes. We downgraded evidence for risk of bias, inconsistency, and imprecision for all comparisons. \nHands off (or poised) compared to hands on \nHands on or hands off the perineum made no clear difference in incidence of intact perineum (average risk ratio (RR) 1.03, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.95 to 1.12, two studies, Tau\u00b2 0.00, I\u00b2 37%, 6547 women; moderate\u2010quality evidence), first\u2010degree perineal tears (average RR 1.32, 95% CI 0.99 to 1.77, two studies, 700 women; low\u2010quality evidence), second\u2010degree tears (average RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.47 to 1.28, two studies, 700 women; low\u2010quality evidence), or third\u2010 or fourth\u2010degree tears (average RR 0.68, 95% CI 0.21 to 2.26, five studies, Tau\u00b2 0.92, I\u00b2 72%, 7317 women; very low\u2010quality evidence). Substantial heterogeneity for third\u2010 or fourth\u2010degree tears means these data should be interpreted with caution. Episiotomy was more frequent in the hands\u2010on group (average RR 0.58, 95% CI 0.43 to 0.79, Tau\u00b2 0.07, I\u00b2 74%, four studies, 7247 women; low\u2010quality evidence), but there was considerable heterogeneity between the four included studies. \nThere were no data for perineal trauma requiring suturing.\nWarm compresses versus control (hands off or no warm compress) \nA warm compress did not have any clear effect on the incidence of intact perineum (average RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.21; 1799 women; four studies; moderate\u2010quality evidence), perineal trauma requiring suturing (average RR 1.14, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.66; 76 women; one study; very low\u2010quality evidence), second\u2010degree tears (average RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.58 to 1.56; 274 women; two studies; very low\u2010quality evidence), or episiotomy (average RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.60 to 1.23; 1799 women; four studies; low\u2010quality evidence). It is uncertain whether warm compress increases or reduces the incidence of first\u2010degree tears (average RR 1.19, 95% CI 0.38 to 3.79; 274 women; two studies; I\u00b2 88%; very low\u2010quality evidence). \nFewer third\u2010 or fourth\u2010degree perineal tears were reported in the warm\u2010compress group (average RR 0.46, 95% CI 0.27 to 0.79; 1799 women; four studies; moderate\u2010quality evidence). \nMassage versus control (hands off or routine care) \nThe incidence of intact perineum was increased in the perineal\u2010massage group (average RR 1.74, 95% CI 1.11 to 2.73, six studies, 2618 women; I\u00b2 83% low\u2010quality evidence) but there was substantial heterogeneity between studies. This group experienced fewer third\u2010 or fourth\u2010degree tears (average RR 0.49, 95% CI 0.25 to 0.94, five studies, 2477 women; moderate\u2010quality evidence). \nThere were no clear differences between groups for perineal trauma requiring suturing (average RR 1.10, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.61, one study, 76 women; very low\u2010quality evidence), first\u2010degree tears (average RR 1.55, 95% CI 0.79 to 3.05, five studies, Tau\u00b2 0.47, I\u00b2 85%, 537 women; very low\u2010quality evidence), or second\u2010degree tears (average RR 1.08, 95% CI 0.55 to 2.12, five studies, Tau\u00b2 0.32, I\u00b2 62%, 537 women; very low\u2010quality evidence). Perineal massage may reduce episiotomy although there was considerable uncertainty around the effect estimate (average RR 0.55, 95% CI 0.29 to 1.03, seven studies, Tau\u00b2 0.43, I\u00b2 92%, 2684 women; very low\u2010quality evidence). Heterogeneity was high for first\u2010degree tear, second\u2010degree tear and for episiotomy \u2010 data should be interpreted with caution. \nRitgen's manoeuvre versus standard care \nOne study (66 women) found that women receiving Ritgen's manoeuvre were less likely to have a first\u2010degree tear (RR 0.32, 95% CI 0.14 to 0.69; very low\u2010quality evidence), more likely to have a second\u2010degree tear (RR 3.25, 95% CI 1.73 to 6.09; very low\u2010quality evidence), and neither more nor less likely to have an intact perineum (RR 0.17, 95% CI 0.02 to 1.31; very low\u2010quality evidence). One larger study reported that Ritgen's manoeuvre did not have an effect on incidence of third\u2010 or fourth\u2010degree tears (RR 1.24, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.96,1423 women; low\u2010quality evidence). Episiotomy was not clearly different between groups (RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.63 to 1.03, two studies, 1489 women; low\u2010quality evidence). \nOther comparisons \nDelivery of posterior versus anterior shoulder first, use of a perineal protection device, different oils/wax, and cold compresses did not show any effects on outcomes with the exception of increased incidence of intact perineum with the perineal device. Only one study contributed to each of these comparisons. \nAuthors' conclusions\nModerate\u2010quality evidence suggests that warm compresses, and massage, may reduce third\u2010 and fourth\u2010degree tears but the impact of these techniques on other outcomes was unclear or inconsistent. Poor\u2010quality evidence suggests hands\u2010off techniques may reduce episiotomy, but this technique had no clear impact on other outcomes. There were insufficient data to show whether other perineal techniques result in improved outcomes. \nFurther research could be performed evaluating perineal techniques, warm compresses and massage, and how different types of oil used during massage affect women and babies. It is important for any future research to collect information on women's views. \n", "10.1002-14651858.CD007565.pub2-abstract.txt": "Background\nOvarian cancer is the sixth most common cancer among women. In addition to diagnosis and staging, primary surgery is performed to achieve optimal cytoreduction (surgical efforts aimed at removing the bulk of the tumour) as the amount of residual tumour is one of the most important prognostic factors for survival of women with epithelial ovarian cancer. An optimal outcome of cytoreductive surgery remains a subject of controversy to many practising gynae\u2010oncologists. The Gynaecologic Oncology group (GOG) currently defines 'optimal' as having residual tumour nodules each measuring 1 cm or less in maximum diameter, with complete cytoreduction (microscopic disease) being the ideal surgical outcome. Although the size of residual tumour masses after surgery has been shown to be an important prognostic factor for advanced ovarian cancer, it is unclear whether it is the surgical procedure that is directly responsible for the superior outcome that is associated with less residual disease. \nObjectives\nTo evaluate the effectiveness and safety of optimal primary cytoreductive surgery for women with surgically staged advanced epithelial ovarian cancer (stages III and IV). \nTo assess the impact of various residual tumour sizes, over a range between zero and 2 cm, on overall survival. \nSearch methods\nWe searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2010, Issue 3) and the Cochrane Gynaecological Cancer Review Group Trials Register, MEDLINE and EMBASE (up to August 2010). We also searched registers of clinical trials, abstracts of scientific meetings, reference lists of included studies and contacted experts in the field. \nSelection criteria\nRetrospective data on residual disease from randomised controlled trials (RCTs) or prospective and retrospective observational studies which included a multivariate analysis of 100 or more adult women with surgically staged advanced epithelial ovarian cancer and who underwent primary cytoreductive surgery followed by adjuvant platinum\u2010based chemotherapy. We only included studies that defined optimal cytoreduction as surgery leading to residual tumours with a maximum diameter of any threshold up to 2 cm. \nData collection and analysis\nTwo review authors independently abstracted data and assessed risk of bias. Where possible, the data were synthesised in a meta\u2010analysis. \nMain results\nThere were no RCTs or prospective non\u2010RCTs identified that were designed to evaluate the effectiveness of surgery when performed as a primary procedure in advanced stage ovarian cancer. \nWe found 11 retrospective studies that included a multivariate analysis that met our inclusion criteria. Analyses showed the prognostic importance of complete cytoreduction, where the residual disease was microscopic that is no visible disease, as overall (OS) and progression\u2010free survival (PFS) were significantly prolonged in these groups of women. PFS was not reported in all of the studies but was sufficiently documented to allow firm conclusions to be drawn. \nWhen we compared suboptimal (> 1 cm) versus optimal (< 1 cm) cytoreduction the survival estimates were attenuated but remained statistically significant in favour of the lower volume disease group There was no significant difference in OS and only a borderline difference in PFS when residual disease of > 2 cm and < 2 cm were compared (hazard ratio (HR) 1.65, 95% CI 0.82 to 3.31; and HR 1.27, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.61, P = 0.05 for OS and PFS respectively). \nThere was a high risk of bias due to the retrospective nature of these studies where, despite statistical adjustment for important prognostic factors, selection bias was still likely to be of particular concern. \nAdverse events, quality of life (QoL) and cost\u2010effectiveness were not reported by treatment arm or to a satisfactory level in any of the studies. \nAuthors' conclusions\nDuring primary surgery for advanced stage epithelial ovarian cancer all attempts should be made to achieve complete cytoreduction. When this is not achievable, the surgical goal should be optimal (< 1 cm) residual disease. Due to the high risk of bias in the current evidence, randomised controlled trials should be performed to determine whether it is the surgical intervention or patient\u2010related and disease\u2010related factors that are associated with the improved survival in these groups of women. The findings of this review that women with residual disease < 1 cm still do better than women with residual disease > 1 cm should prompt the surgical community to retain this category and consider re\u2010defining it as 'near optimal' cytoreduction, reserving the term 'suboptimal' cytoreduction to cases where the residual disease is > 1 cm (optimal/near optimal/suboptimal instead of complete/optimal/suboptimal). \n", "10.1002-14651858.CD003552.pub4-abstract.txt": "Background\nThe delivery of combination contraceptive steroids from a transdermal contraceptive patch or a contraceptive vaginal ring offers potential advantages over the traditional oral route. The transdermal patch and vaginal ring could require a lower dose due to increased bioavailability and improved user compliance. \nObjectives\nTo compare the contraceptive effectiveness, cycle control, compliance (adherence), and safety of the contraceptive patch or the vaginal ring versus combination oral contraceptives (COCs). \nSearch methods\nThrough February 2013, we searched MEDLINE, POPLINE, CENTRAL, LILACS, ClinicalTrials.gov, and ICTRP for trials of the contraceptive patch or the vaginal ring. Earlier searches also included EMBASE. For the initial review, we contacted known researchers and manufacturers to identify other trials. \nSelection criteria\nWe considered randomized controlled trials comparing a transdermal contraceptive patch or a contraceptive vaginal ring with a COC. \nData collection and analysis\nData were abstracted by two authors and entered into RevMan. For dichotomous variables, the Peto odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) was calculated. For continuous variables, the mean difference was computed. We also assessed the quality of evidence for this review. \nMain results\nWe found 18 trials that met our inclusion criteria. Of six patch studies, five examined the marketed patch containing norelgestromin plus ethinyl estradiol (EE); one studied a patch in development that contains levonorgestrel (LNG) plus EE. Of 12 vaginal ring trials, 11 examined the same marketing ring containing etonogestrel plus EE; one studied a ring being developed that contains nesterone plus EE. \nContraceptive effectiveness was not significantly different for the patch or ring versus the comparison COC. Compliance data were limited. Patch users showed better compliance than COC users in three trials. For the norelgestromin plus EE patch, ORs were 2.05 (95% CI 1.83 to 2.29) and 2.76 (95% CI 2.35 to 3.24). In the levonorgestrel plus EE patch report, patch users were less likely to have missed days of therapy (OR 0.36; 95% CI 0.25 to 0.51). Of four vaginal ring trials, one found ring users had more noncompliance (OR 3.99; 95% CI 1.87 to 8.52), while another showed more compliance with the regimen (OR 1.67; 95% CI 1.04 to 2.68). \nMore patch users discontinued early than COC users. ORs from two meta\u2010analyses were 1.59 (95% CI 1.26 to 2.00) and 1.56 (95% CI 1.18 to 2.06) and another trial showed OR 2.57 (95% CI 0.99 to 6.64). Patch users also had more discontinuation due to adverse events than COC users. Users of the norelgestromin\u2010containing patch reported more breast discomfort, dysmenorrhea, nausea, and vomiting. In the levonorgestrel\u2010containing patch trial, patch users reported less vomiting, headaches, and fatigue. \nOf 11 ring trials with discontinuation data, two showed the ring group discontinued less than the COC group: OR 0.32 (95% CI 0.16 to 0.66) and OR 0.52 (95% CI 0.31 to 0.88). Ring users were less likely to discontinue due to adverse events in one study (OR 0.32; 95% CI 0.15 to 0.70). Compared to the COC users, ring users had more vaginitis and leukorrhea but less vaginal dryness. Ring users also reported less nausea, acne, irritability, depression, and emotional lability than COC users. \nFor cycle control, only one trial study showed a significant difference. Women in the patch group were less likely to have breakthrough bleeding and spotting. Seven ring studies had bleeding data; four trials showed the ring group generally had better cycle control than the COC group. \nAuthors' conclusions\nEffectiveness was not significantly different for the methods compared. Pregnancy data were available from half of the patch trials but two\u2010thirds of ring trials. The patch could lead to more discontinuation than the COC. The patch group had better compliance than the COC group. Compliance data came from half of the patch studies and one\u2010third of the ring trials. Patch users had more side effects than the COC group. Ring users generally had fewer adverse events than COC users but more vaginal irritation and discharge. \nThe quality of the evidence for this review was considered low for the patch and moderate for the ring. The main reasons for downgrading were lack of information on the randomization sequence generation or allocation concealment, the outcome assessment methods, high losses to follow up, and exclusions after randomization. \n", "10.1002-14651858.CD011364.pub2-abstract.txt": "Background\nArterial line cannulation in paediatric patients is traditionally performed by palpation or with Doppler auditory assistance in locating the artery before catheterization. It is not clear whether ultrasound guidance offers benefits over these methods. \nObjectives\nTo assess first attempt success rates and complication rates when ultrasound guidance is used for arterial line placement in the paediatric population, as compared with traditional techniques (palpation, Doppler auditory assistance), at all potential sites for arterial cannulation (left or right radial, ulnar, brachial, femoral or dorsalis pedis artery). \nSearch methods\nWe searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE (Ovid) and Embase (Ovid). We also searched databases of ongoing trials (ClinicalTrials.gov (www.clinicaltrials.gov/), Current Controlled Trials metaRegister (www.controlled\u2010trials.com/), the EU Clinical Trials register (www.clinicaltrialsregister.eu/) and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (http://apps.who.int/trialsearch/). We tried to identify other potentially eligible trials by searching the reference lists of retrieved included trials and related systematic or other reviews. We searched until January 2016. \nSelection criteria\nWe included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing ultrasound guidance versus palpation or Doppler auditory assistance to guide arterial line cannulation in paediatrics. \nData collection and analysis\nTwo review authors independently assessed the risk of bias of included trials and extracted data. We used standard Cochrane meta\u2010analytical procedures, and we applied the GRADE method to assess the quality of evidence. \nMain results\nWe included five RCTs reporting 444 arterial cannulations in paediatric participants. Four RCTs compared ultrasound with palpation, and one compared ultrasound with Doppler auditory assistance. \nRisk of bias varied across studies, with some studies lacking details of allocation concealment. It was not possible to blind practitioners in all of the included studies; this adds a performance bias that is inherent to the type of intervention studied in our review. Only two studies reported the rate of complications. \nMeta\u2010analysis showed that ultrasound guidance produces superior success rates at first attempt (risk ratio (RR) 1.96, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.34 to 2.85, 404 catheters, four RCTs, moderate\u2010quality evidence) and fewer complications, such as haematoma formation (RR 0.20, 95% CI 0.07 to 0.60, 222 catheters, two RCTs, moderate\u2010quality evidence). Our results suggest, but do not confirm, that a possible advantage of ultrasound guidance for the first attempt success rate over other techniques is more pronounced in infants and small children than in older children. Similarly, our results suggest, but do not confirm, the possibility of a positive influence of expertise in the use of ultrasound on the first attempt success rate. We also found improved success rates within two attempts (RR 1.78, 95% CI 1.25 to 2.51, 134 catheters, two RCTs, moderate\u2010quality evidence) with ultrasound guidance compared with other types of guidance. No studies reported data about ischaemic damage. We rated the quality of evidence for all outcomes as moderate owing to imprecision due to wide confidence intervals, modest sample sizes and limited numbers of events. \nAuthors' conclusions\nWe identified moderate\u2010quality evidence suggesting that ultrasound guidance for radial artery cannulation improves first and second attempt success rates and decreases the rate of complications as compared with palpation or Doppler auditory assistance. The improved success rate at the first attempt may be more pronounced in infants and small children, in whom arterial line cannulation is more challenging than in older children. \n", "10.1002-14651858.CD008838.pub2-abstract.txt": "Background\nVenom immunotherapy (VIT) is commonly used for preventing further allergic reactions to insect stings in people who have had a sting reaction. The efficacy and safety of this treatment has not previously been assessed by a high\u2010quality systematic review. \nObjectives\nTo assess the effects of immunotherapy using extracted insect venom for preventing further allergic reactions to insect stings in people who have had an allergic reaction to a sting. \nSearch methods\nWe searched the following databases up to February 2012: the Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL in The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE (from 1946), EMBASE (from 1974), PsycINFO (from 1806), AMED (from 1985), LILACS (from 1982), the Armed Forces Pest Management Board Literature Retrieval System, and OpenGrey. There were no language or publication status restrictions to our searches. We searched trials databases, abstracts from recent European and North American allergy meetings, and the references of identified review articles in order to identify further relevant trials. \nSelection criteria\nRandomised controlled trials of venom immunotherapy using standardised venom extract in insect sting allergy. \nData collection and analysis\nTwo authors independently undertook study selection, data extraction, and assessment of risk of bias. We identified adverse events from included controlled trials and from a separate analysis of observational studies identified as part of a National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence Health Technology Assessment. \nMain results\nWe identified 6 randomised controlled trials and 1 quasi\u2010randomised controlled trial for inclusion in the review; the total number of participants was 392. The trials had some risk of bias because five of the trials did not blind outcome assessors to treatment allocation. The interventions included ant, bee, and wasp immunotherapy in children or adults with previous systemic or large local reactions to a sting, using sublingual (one trial) or subcutaneous (six trials) VIT. We found that VIT is effective for preventing systemic allergic reaction to an insect sting, which was our primary outcome measure. This applies whether the sting occurs accidentally or is given intentionally as part of a trial procedure. \nIn the trials, 3/113 (2.7%) participants treated with VIT had a subsequent systemic allergic reaction to a sting, compared with 37/93 (39.8%) untreated participants (risk ratio [RR] 0.10, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.03 to 0.28). The efficacy of VIT was similar across studies; we were unable to identify a patient group or mode of treatment with different efficacy, although these analyses were limited by small numbers. We were unable to confirm whether VIT prevents fatal reactions to insect stings, because of the rarity of this outcome. \nVenom immunotherapy was also effective for preventing large local reactions to a sting (5 studies; 112 follow\u2010up stings; RR 0.41, 95% CI 0.24 to 0.69) and for improving quality of life (mean difference [MD] in favour of VIT 1.21 points on a 7\u2010point scale, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.67). \nWe found a significant risk of systemic adverse reaction to VIT treatment: 6 trials reported this outcome, in which 14 of 150 (9.3%) participants treated with VIT and 1 of 135 (0.7%) participants treated with placebo or no treatment suffered a systemic reaction to treatment (RR 8.16, 95% CI 1.53 to 43.46; 2 studies contributed to the effect estimate). Our analysis of 11 observational studies found systemic adverse reactions occurred in 131/921 (14.2%) participants treated with bee venom VIT and 8/289 (2.8%) treated with wasp venom VIT. \nAuthors' conclusions\nWe found venom immunotherapy using extracted insect venom to be an effective therapy for preventing further allergic reactions to insect stings, which can improve quality of life. The treatment carries a small but significant risk of systemic adverse reaction. \n", "10.1002-14651858.CD013740.pub2-abstract.txt": "Background\nMindfulness interventions are increasingly popular as an approach to improve mental well\u2010being.

Reference lists of relevant articles were also searched. \nSelection criteria\nWe included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing any two protocols of GnRHa used in in vitro fertilisation (IVF) or intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) cycles in subfertile women. \nData collection and analysis\nTwo review authors independently selected studies, assessed trial eligibility and risk of bias, and extracted the data. The primary outcome measure was number of live births or ongoing pregnancies per woman/couple randomised. Secondary outcome measures were number of clinical pregnancies, number of oocytes retrieved, dose of gonadotrophins used, adverse effects (pregnancy losses, ovarian hyperstimulation, cycle cancellation, and premature luteinising hormone (LH) surges), and cost and acceptability of the regimens. We combined data to calculate odds ratios (OR) for dichotomous variables and mean differences (MD) for continuous variables, with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We assessed statistical heterogeneity using the I\u00b2 statistic. We assessed the overall quality of the evidence for the main comparisons using 'Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation' (GRADE) methods. \nMain results\nWe included 37 RCTs (3872 women), one ongoing trial, and one trial awaiting classification. These trials made nine different comparisons between protocols. Twenty of the RCTs compared long protocols and short protocols. Only 19/37 RCTs reported live birth or ongoing pregnancy. \nThere was no conclusive evidence of a difference between a long protocol and a short protocol in live birth and ongoing pregnancy rates (OR 1.30, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.81; 12 RCTs, n = 976 women, I\u00b2 = 15%, low quality evidence). Our findings suggest that in a population in which 14% of women achieve live birth or ongoing pregnancy using a short protocol, between 13% and 23% will achieve live birth or ongoing pregnancy using a long protocol. There was evidence of an increase in clinical pregnancy rates (OR 1.50, 95% CI 1.18 to 1.92; 20 RCTs, n = 1643 women, I\u00b2 = 27%, moderate quality evidence) associated with the use of a long protocol. \nThere was no evidence of a difference between the groups in terms of live birth and ongoing pregnancy rates when the following GnRHa protocols were compared: long versus ultrashort protocol (OR 1.78, 95% CI 0.72 to 4.36; one RCT, n = 150 women, low quality evidence), long luteal versus long follicular phase protocol (OR 1.89, 95% CI 0.87 to 4.10; one RCT, n = 223 women, low quality evidence), when GnRHa was stopped versus when it was continued (OR 0.75, 95% CI 0.42 to 1.33; three RCTs, n = 290 women, I\u00b2 = 0%, low quality evidence), when the dose of GnRHa was reduced versus when the same dose was continued (OR 1.02, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.52; four RCTs, n = 407 women, I\u00b2 = 0%, low quality evidence), when GnRHa was discontinued versus continued after human chorionic gonadotrophin (HCG) administration in the long protocol (OR 0.89, 95% CI 0.49 to 1.64; one RCT, n = 181 women, low quality evidence), and when administration of GnRHa lasted for two versus three weeks before stimulation (OR 1.14, 95% CI 0.49 to 2.68; one RCT, n = 85 women, low quality evidence). Our primary outcomes were not reported for any other comparisons. \nRegarding adverse events, there were insufficient data to enable us to reach any conclusions except about the cycle cancellation rate. There was no conclusive evidence of a difference in cycle cancellation rate (OR 0.95, 95% CI 0.59 to 1.55; 11 RCTs, n = 1026 women, I\u00b2 = 42%, low quality evidence) when a long protocol was compared with a short protocol. This suggests that in a population in which 9% of women would have their cycles cancelled using a short protocol, between 5.5% and 14% will have cancelled cycles when using a long protocol. \nThe quality of the evidence ranged from moderate to low. The main limitations in the evidence were failure to report live birth or ongoing pregnancy, poor reporting of methods in the primary studies, and imprecise findings due to lack of data. Only 10 of the 37 included studies were conducted within the last 10 years. \nAuthors' conclusions\nWhen long GnRHa protocols and short GnRHa protocols were compared, we found no conclusive evidence of a difference in live birth and ongoing pregnancy rates, but there was moderate quality evidence of higher clinical pregnancy rates in the long protocol group. None of the other analyses showed any evidence of a difference in birth or pregnancy outcomes between the protocols compared.

Injury to these two branches of the mandibular division of the trigeminal nerve may result in altered sensation associated with the ipsilateral lower lip or tongue or both and may include anaesthesia, paraesthesia, dysaesthesia, hyperalgesia, allodynia, hypoaesthesia and hyperaesthesia. Injury to the lingual nerve may also affect taste perception on the affected side of the tongue. The vast majority (approximately 90%) of these injuries are temporary in nature and resolve within eight weeks. However, if the injury persists beyond six months it is deemed to be permanent. Surgical, medical and psychological techniques have been used as a treatment for such injuries, though at present there is no consensus on the preferred intervention, or the timing of the intervention. \nObjectives\nTo evaluate the effects of different interventions and timings of interventions to treat iatrogenic injury of the inferior alveolar or lingual nerves. \nSearch methods\nWe searched the following electronic databases: the Cochrane Oral Health Group's Trial Register (to 9 October 2013), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2013, Issue 9), MEDLINE via OVID (1946 to 9 October 2013) and EMBASE via OVID (1980 to 9 October 2013). No language restrictions were placed on the language or date of publication when searching the electronic databases. \nSelection criteria\nRandomised controlled trials (RCTs) involving interventions to treat patients with neurosensory defect of the inferior alveolar or lingual nerve or both as a sequela of iatrogenic injury. \nData collection and analysis\nWe used the standard methodological procedures expected by The Cochrane Collaboration. We performed data extraction and assessment of the risk of bias independently and in duplicate. We contacted authors to clarify the inclusion criteria of the studies. \nMain results\nTwo studies assessed as at high risk of bias, reporting data from 26 analysed participants were included in this review. The age range of participants was from 17 to 55 years. Both trials investigated the effectiveness of low\u2010level laser treatment compared to placebo laser therapy on inferior alveolar sensory deficit as a result of iatrogenic injury. \nPatient\u2010reported altered sensation was partially reported in one study and fully reported in another. Following treatment with laser therapy, there was some evidence of an improvement in the subjective assessment of neurosensory deficit in the lip and chin areas compared to placebo, though the estimates were imprecise: a difference in mean change in neurosensory deficit of the chin of 8.40 cm (95% confidence interval (CI) 3.67 to 13.13) and a difference in mean change in neurosensory deficit of the lip of 21.79 cm (95% CI 5.29 to 38.29). The overall quality of the evidence for this outcome was very low; the outcome data were fully reported in one small study of 13 patients, with differential drop\u2010out in the control group, and patients suffered only partial loss of sensation. No studies reported on the effects of the intervention on the remaining primary outcomes of pain, difficulty eating or speaking or taste. No studies reported on quality of life or adverse events. \nThe overall quality of the evidence was very low as a result of limitations in the conduct and reporting of the studies, indirectness of the evidence and the imprecision of the results. \nAuthors' conclusions\nThere is clearly a need for randomised controlled clinical trials to investigate the effectiveness of surgical, medical and psychological interventions for iatrogenic inferior alveolar and lingual nerve injuries. Primary outcomes of this research should include: patient\u2010focused morbidity measures including altered sensation and pain, pain, quantitative sensory testing and the effects of delayed treatment. \n", "10.1002-14651858.CD009961.pub2-abstract.txt": "Background\nIn people with haemophilia or other congenital bleeding disorders undergoing surgical interventions, haemostatic treatment is needed in order to correct the underlying coagulation abnormalities and minimise the bleeding risk.

Meta\u2010analyses were performed on available and relevant data. \nMain results\nOf the 16 identified trials, four (112 participants) were eligible for inclusion.\nTwo trials evaluated 59 people with haemophilia A and B undergoing 63 dental extractions. Trials compared the use of a different type (tranexamic acid or epsilon\u2010aminocaproic acid) and regimen of antifibrinolytic agents as haemostatic support to the initial replacement treatment. Neither trial specifically addressed mortality (one of this review's primary outcomes); however, in the frame of safety assessments, no fatal adverse events were reported. The second primary outcome of blood loss was assessed after surgery and these trials showed the reduction of blood loss and requirement of post\u2010operative replacement treatment in people receiving antifibrinolytic agents compared with placebo. The remaining primary outcome of need for re\u2010intervention was not reported by either trial. \nTwo trials reported on 53 people with haemophilia A and B with inhibitors treated with different regimens of recombinant activated factor VII (rFVIIa) for haemostatic coverage of 33 major and 20 minor surgical interventions. Neither of the included trials specifically addressed any of the review's primary outcomes (mortality, blood loss and need for re\u2010intervention). In one trial a high\u2010dose rFVIIa regimen (90 \u03bcg/kg) was compared with a low\u2010dose regimen (35 \u03bcg/kg); the higher dose showed increased haemostatic efficacy, in particular in major surgery, with shorter duration of treatment, similar total dose of rFVIIa administered and similar safety levels. In the second trial, bolus infusion and continuous infusion of rFVIIa were compared, showing similar haemostatic efficacy, duration of treatment and safety. \nAuthors' conclusions\nThere is insufficient evidence from randomised controlled trials to assess the most effective and safe haemostatic treatment to prevent bleeding in people with haemophilia or other congenital bleeding disorders undergoing surgical procedures. Ideally large, adequately powered, and well\u2010designed randomised controlled trials would be needed, in particular to address the cost\u2010effectiveness of such demanding treatments in the light of the increasing present economic constraints, and to explore the new challenge of ageing patients with haemophilia or other congenital bleeding disorders. However, performing such trials is always a complex task in this setting and presently does not appear to be a clinical and research priority. Indeed, major and minor surgeries are effectively and safely performed in these individuals in clinical practice, with the numerous national and international recommendations and guidelines providing regimens for treatment in this setting mainly based on data from observational, uncontrolled studies. \n", "10.1002-14651858.CD010222.pub4-abstract.txt": "Background\nAcute pulmonary embolism (PE) is a common cause of death, accounting for 50,000 to 200,000 deaths annually. It is the third most common cause of mortality among the cardiovascular diseases, after coronary artery disease and stroke. The advent of multi\u2010detector computed tomographic pulmonary angiography (CTPA) has allowed better assessment of PE regarding visualisation of the peripheral pulmonary arteries, increasing its rate of diagnosis. More cases of peripheral PEs, such as isolated subsegmental PE (SSPE) and incidental PE, have thereby been identified. These two conditions are usually found in patients with few or none of the classic PE symptoms such as haemoptysis or pleuritic pain, acute dyspnoea or circulatory collapse. However, in patients with reduced cardiopulmonary reserve, classic PE symptoms can be found with isolated SSPEs. Incidental SSPE is found casually in asymptomatic patients, usually by diagnostic imaging performed for other reasons (for example routine CT for cancer staging in oncology patients). Traditionally, all PEs are anticoagulated in a similar manner independent of their location, or number and size of the thrombi. It has been suggested that many patients with SSPE may be treated without benefit, increasing adverse events by a possible unnecessary use of anticoagulants. Patients with isolated SSPE, or incidental PE, may have a more benign clinical presentation compared to those with proximal PEs. However, the clinical significance in patients, and their prognosis, needs to be studied to evaluate whether anticoagulation therapy is required.

Other outcomes included incidences of all\u2010cause mortality, graft loss, graft rejection, graft function, hospitalisation for UTI, adverse reactions to antimicrobial agents and relapse or persistence of asymptomatic bacteriuria. We expressed dichotomous outcomes as absolute risk difference (RD) or risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) and continuous data as mean differences (MD) with 95% CI. Data were pooled using the random effects model. \nMain results\nWe included two studies (212 participants) comparing antibiotics versus no treatment, and identified three on\u2010going studies. Overall, incidence of symptomatic UTI varied between 19% and 31% in the groups not treated for asymptomatic bacteriuria. Antibiotic treatment had uncertain effects on preventing symptomatic UTI (2 studies, 200 participants: RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.51 to 1.45). Risk for selecting multidrug\u2010resistant organisms was uncertain with antibiotic treatment (1 study, 112 participants: RR 1.21, 95% CI 0.60 to 2.41). Persistence of asymptomatic bacteriuria was high regardless of treatment. Antibiotics also have uncertain effects on other important patient and graft outcomes, for instance on all\u2010cause mortality (1 study, 112 participants: RR 2.23, 95% CI 0.21 to 23.86), graft loss (1 study, 112 participants: RR 1.11, 95% CI 0.07 to 17.36), acute rejection (1 study, 112 participants: RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.44 to 1.97), hospitalisation for UTI (1 study, 112 participants: RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.13 to 4.27), graft function (2 studies, 200 participants, MD in serum creatinine concentration \u20100.06 mg/dL, 95% CI \u20100.19 to 0.08) and adverse reactions (1 study, 112 participants: no severe adverse event attributable to the antibiotic treatment). Evidence quality was low for all outcomes. \nAuthors' conclusions\nCurrently, there is insufficient evidence to support routinely treating kidney transplant recipients with antibiotics in case of asymptomatic bacteriuria after transplantation, but data are scarce.

The searches were not restricted by language or publication status. We also handsearched the reference lists of relevant papers and reviews. \nSelection criteria\nRandomised controlled trials, controlled before\u2010after (CBA) studies and interrupted time\u2010series (ITS) of all types of interventions for preventing fatal and non\u2010fatal injuries among workers at construction sites. \nData collection and analysis\nTwo review authors independently selected studies, extracted data and assessed their risk of bias. For ITS studies, we re\u2010analysed the studies and used an initial effect, measured as the change in injury rate in the year after the intervention, as well as a sustained effect, measured as the change in time trend before and after the intervention. \nMain results\nSeventeen studies (14 ITS and 3 CBA studies) met the inclusion criteria in this updated version of the review. The ITS studies evaluated the effects of: introducing or changing regulations that laid down safety and health requirements for the construction sites (nine studies), a safety campaign (two studies), a drug\u2010free workplace programme (one study), a training programme (one study), and safety inspections (one study) on fatal and non\u2010fatal occupational injuries. One CBA study evaluated the introduction of occupational health services such as risk assessment and health surveillance, one evaluated a training programme and one evaluated the effect of a subsidy for upgrading to safer scaffoldings. The overall risk of bias of most of the included studies was high, as it was uncertain for the ITS studies whether the intervention was independent from other changes and thus could be regarded as the main reason of change in the outcome. Therefore, we rated the quality of the evidence as very low for all comparisons. \nCompulsory interventions \nRegulatory interventions at national or branch level may or may not have an initial effect (effect size (ES) of \u22120.33; 95% confidence interval (CI) \u22122.08 to 1.41) and may or may not have a sustained effect (ES \u22120.03; 95% CI \u22120.30 to 0.24) on fatal and non\u2010fatal injuries (9 ITS studies) due to highly inconsistent results (I\u00b2 = 98%). Inspections may or may not have an effect on non\u2010fatal injuries (ES 0.07; 95% CI \u22122.83 to 2.97; 1 ITS study). \nEducational interventions \nSafety training interventions may result in no significant reduction of non\u2010fatal injuries (1 ITS study and 1 CBA study). \nInformational interventions \nWe found no studies that had evaluated informational interventions alone such as campaigns for risk communication. \nPersuasive interventions \nWe found no studies that had evaluated persuasive interventions alone such as peer feedback on workplace actions to increase acceptance of safe working methods. \nFacilitative interventions \nMonetary subsidies to companies may lead to a greater decrease in non\u2010fatal injuries from falls to a lower level than no subsidies (risk ratio (RR) at follow\u2010up: 0.93; 95% CI 0.30 to 2.91 from RR 3.89 at baseline; 1 CBA study). \nMultifaceted interventions \nA safety campaign intervention may result in an initial (ES \u22121.82; 95% CI \u22122.90 to \u22120.74) and sustained (ES \u22121.30; 95% CI \u22121.79 to \u22120.81) decrease in injuries at the company level (1 ITS study), but not at the regional level (1 ITS study). A multifaceted drug\u2010free workplace programme at the company level may reduce non\u2010fatal injuries in the year following implementation by \u22127.6 per 100 person\u2010years (95% CI \u221211.2 to \u22124.0) and in the years thereafter by \u22122.0 per 100 person\u2010years (95% CI \u22123.5 to \u22120.5) (1 ITS study). Introducing occupational health services may result in no decrease in fatal or non\u2010fatal injuries (one CBA study). \nAuthors' conclusions\nThe vast majority of interventions to adopt safety measures recommended by standard texts on safety, consultants and safety courses have not been adequately evaluated. There is very low\u2010quality evidence that introducing regulations as such may or may not result in a decrease in fatal and non\u2010fatal injuries. There is also very low\u2010quality evidence that regionally oriented safety campaigns, training, inspections or the introduction of occupational health services may not reduce non\u2010fatal injuries in construction companies. There is very low\u2010quality evidence that company\u2010oriented safety interventions such as a multifaceted safety campaign, a multifaceted drug workplace programme and subsidies for replacement of scaffoldings may reduce non\u2010fatal injuries among construction workers. More studies, preferably cluster\u2010randomised controlled trials, are needed to evaluate different strategies to increase the employers' and workers' adherence to the safety measures prescribed by regulation. \n", "10.1002-14651858.CD011979.pub2-abstract.txt": "Background\nFoot ulcers are a disabling complication of diabetes that affect 15% to 25% of people with diabetes at some time in their lives. Phototherapy is a relatively new, non\u2010invasive, and pain\u2010free treatment method, which promotes the ulcer repair process through multiple mechanisms such as increased cell growth and vascular activity. Phototherapy may be used as an alternative approach for the treatment of foot ulcers in people with diabetes, but the evidence for its effect compared with placebo or other treatments has not yet been established. \nObjectives\nTo assess the effects of phototherapy for the treatment of foot ulcers in people with diabetes. \nSearch methods\nWe searched the Cochrane Wounds Specialised Register (11 October 2016), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (the Cochrane Library, 2016, Issue 10), Ovid MEDLINE (11 October 2016), Ovid MEDLINE (In\u2010Process & Other Non\u2010Indexed Citations) (11 October 2016), Ovid Embase (11 October 2016), EBSCO CINAHL Plus (11 October 2016), and China National Knowledge Infrastructure (24 June 2017). We also searched clinical trials registries for ongoing and unpublished studies on 24 June 2017, and screened reference lists to identify additional studies. We used no restrictions with respect to language, date of publication, or study setting. \nSelection criteria\nRandomised controlled trials or cluster randomised controlled trials that 1) compared phototherapy with sham phototherapy, no phototherapy, or other physical therapy modalities, 2) compared different forms of phototherapy, or 3) compared phototherapy of different output power, wavelength, power density, or dose range, in adults with diabetes and an open foot ulcer of any severity, in any setting. \nData collection and analysis\nTwo review authors independently performed study selection, data extraction, and 'Risk of bias' assessment. We combined the study outcomes when appropriate. \nMain results\nEight trials with 316 participants met the inclusion criteria. Most of the included studies were single\u2010centre studies that were carried out in clinics or hospitals with a sample size ranging from 14 to 84. We generally considered the included studies to be at unclear or high risk of bias, as they had one domain at high risk of bias, or three or more domains at unclear risk of bias. \nWe did not identify any studies that reported valid data for time to complete wound healing. Meta\u2010analysis of four studies including 116 participants indicated that participants receiving phototherapy may experience a greater proportion of wounds completely healed during follow\u2010up compared with those receiving no phototherapy/placebo (64.5% for the phototherapy group versus 37.0% for the no phototherapy/placebo group; risk ratio 1.57, 95% confidence interval 1.08 to 2.28; low\u2010quality evidence, downgraded for study limitations and imprecision). Two studies mentioned adverse events in the results; one study with 16 participants suggested that there were no device\u2010related adverse events, and the other study with 14 participants suggested that there was no clear difference between phototherapy and placebo group. \nFour studies reported change in ulcer size, but primarily due to high heterogeneity, they were not combined. Results from individual trials (including 16 participants to 84 participants) generally suggested that after two to four weeks of treatment phototherapy may result in a greater reduction in ulcer size but the quality of the evidence was low due to unclear risk of bias in the original trial and small sample size. We based the analyses for quality of life and amputations on only one study each (28 participants and 23 participants respectively); both outcomes showed no clear difference between the phototherapy group and the no phototherapy/placebo group. \nAuthors' conclusions\nThis systematic review of randomised trials suggested that phototherapy, when compared to no phototherapy/placebo, may increase the proportion of wounds completely healed during follow\u2010up and may reduce wound size in people with diabetes, but there was no evidence that phototherapy improves quality of life. Due to the small sample size and methodological flaws in the original trials, the quality of the evidence was low, which reduces our confidence in these results. Large, well\u2010designed randomised controlled trials are needed to confirm whether phototherapy could be an effective option for the treatment of foot ulcers in people with diabetes. \n", "10.1002-14651858.CD008844.pub2-abstract.txt": "Background\nAcute myocardial infarction (AMI) is the leading cause of death in developed countries, and current treatment modalities have failed to regenerate the dead myocardium resulting from the ischemic damage. Stem cells have the potential to regenerate the damaged myocardium. These cells can be mobilized from the bone marrow by factors such as granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G\u2010CSF). \nObjectives\nTo assess the effects of stem cell mobilization following granulocyte colony stimulating factor therapy in patients with acute myocardial infarction. \nSearch methods\nWe searched CENTRAL (The Cochrane Library Issue 4, 2010), MEDLINE (1950 to November week 3, 2010), EMBASE (1980 to 2010 week 48), BIOSIS Previews (1969 to 30 November 2010), ISI Science Citation Index Expanded (1970 to 4 December 2010) and ISI Conference Proceedings Citation Index \u2010 Science (1990 to 4 December 2010). We also checked reference lists of articles. \nSelection criteria\nWe included randomized controlled trials including participants with a clinical diagnosis of AMI who were randomly allocated to the subcutaneous administration of G\u2010CSF through a daily dose of 2.5, 5 or 10 microgram/kg for four to six days or placebo. No age or other restrictions were applied for the selection of patients. \nData collection and analysis\nTwo authors independently selected trials, assessed trials for eligibility and methodological quality, and extracted data regarding the clinical efficacy and adverse outcomes. Disagreements were resolved by the third author. \nMain results\nWe included seven trials reported in 30 references in the review (354 participants). In all trials, G\u2010CSF was compared with placebo preparations. Dosage of G\u2010CSF varied among studies, ranging from 2.5 to 10 microgram/kg/day. Regarding overall risk of bias, data regarding the generation of randomization sequence and incomplete outcome data were at a low risk of bias; however, data regarding binding of personnel were not conclusive. The rate of mortality was not different between the two groups (RR 0.64, 95% CI 0.15 to 2.80, P = 0.55). Regarding safety, the limited amount of evidence is inadequate to reach any conclusions regarding the safety of G\u2010CSF therapy. Moreover, the results did not show any beneficial effects of G\u2010CSF in patients with AMI regarding left ventricular function parameters, including left ventricular ejection fraction (RR 3.41, 95% CI \u20100.61 to 7.44, P = 0.1), end systolic volume (RR \u20101.35, 95% CI \u20104.68 to 1.99, P = 0.43) and end diastolic volume (RR \u20104.08, 95% CI \u20108.28 to 0.12, P = 0.06). It should also be noted that the study was limited since the trials included lacked long enough follow up durations. \nAuthors' conclusions\nLimited evidence from small trials suggested a lack of benefit of G\u2010CSF therapy in patients with AMI. Since data of the risk of bias regarding blinding of personnel were not conclusive, larger RCTs with appropriate power calculations and longer follow up durations are required in order to address current uncertainties regarding the clinical efficacy and therapy\u2010related adverse events of G\u2010CSF treatment. \n", "10.1002-14651858.CD008011.pub3-abstract.txt": "Background\nAnthracyclines are frequently used chemotherapeutic agents for childhood cancer that can cause cardiotoxicity during and after treatment. Although several medical interventions in adults with symptomatic or asymptomatic cardiac dysfunction due to other causes are beneficial, it is not known if the same treatments are effective for childhood cancer patients and survivors with anthracycline\u2010induced cardiotoxicity. This review is an update of a previously published Cochrane review. \nObjectives\nTo compare the effect of medical interventions on anthracycline\u2010induced cardiotoxicity in childhood cancer patients or survivors with the effect of placebo, other medical interventions, or no treatment. \nSearch methods\nWe searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (the Cochrane Library, 2015, Issue 8), MEDLINE/PubMed (1949 to September 2015), and EMBASE/Ovid (1980 to September 2015) for potentially relevant articles. In addition, we searched reference lists of relevant articles, conference proceedings of the International Society for Paediatric Oncology (SIOP), the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO), the American Society of Hematology (ASH), the International Conference on Long\u2010Term Complications of Treatment of Children & Adolescents for Cancer, and the European Symposium on Late Complications from Childhood Cancer (from 2005 to 2015), and ongoing trial databases (the ISRCTN Register, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Register, and the trials register of the World Health Organization (WHO); all searched in September 2015). \nSelection criteria\nRandomised controlled trials (RCTs) or controlled clinical trials (CCTs) comparing the effectiveness of medical interventions to treat anthracycline\u2010induced cardiotoxicity with either placebo, other medical interventions, or no treatment. \nData collection and analysis\nTwo review authors independently performed the study selection. One review author performed the data extraction and 'Risk of bias' assessments, which another review author checked. We performed analyses according to the guidelines in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions. \nMain results\nIn the original version of the review we identified two RCTs; in this update we identified no additional studies. One trial (135 participants) compared enalapril with placebo in childhood cancer survivors with asymptomatic anthracycline\u2010induced cardiac dysfunction. The other trial (68 participants) compared a two\u2010week treatment of phosphocreatine with a control treatment (vitamin C, adenosine triphosphate, vitamin E, oral coenzyme Q10) in leukaemia patients with anthracycline\u2010induced cardiotoxicity. Both studies had methodological limitations. \nThe RCT on enalapril showed no statistically significant differences in overall survival, mortality due to heart failure, development of clinical heart failure, and quality of life between treatment and control groups. A post\u2010hoc analysis showed a decrease (that is improvement) in one measure of cardiac function (left ventricular end\u2010systolic wall stress (LVESWS): \u20108.62% change) compared with placebo (+1.66% change) in the first year of treatment (P = 0.036), but not afterwards. Participants treated with enalapril had a higher risk of dizziness or hypotension (risk ratio 7.17, 95% confidence interval 1.71 to 30.17) and fatigue (Fisher's exact test, P = 0.013). \nThe RCT on phosphocreatine found no differences in overall survival, mortality due to heart failure, echocardiographic cardiac function, and adverse events between treatment and control groups. \nAuthors' conclusions\nOnly one trial evaluated the effect of enalapril in childhood cancer survivors with asymptomatic cardiac dysfunction. Although there is some evidence that enalapril temporarily improves one parameter of cardiac function (LVESWS), it is unclear whether it improves clinical outcomes. Enalapril was associated with a higher risk of dizziness or hypotension and fatigue. Clinicians should weigh the possible benefits with the known side effects of enalapril in childhood cancer survivors with asymptomatic anthracycline\u2010induced cardiotoxicity. \nOnly one trial evaluated the effect of phosphocreatine in childhood cancer patients with anthracycline\u2010induced cardiotoxicity. Limited data with a high risk of bias showed no significant difference between phosphocreatine and control treatments on echocardiographic function and clinical outcomes. \nWe did not identify any RCTs or CCTs studying other medical interventions for symptomatic or asymptomatic cardiotoxicity in childhood cancer patients or survivors. \nHigh\u2010quality studies should be performed.\n", "10.1002-14651858.CD012626.pub2-abstract.txt": "Background\nEscalating awareness of the magnitude of the challenge posed by low levels of physical activity in people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) highlights the need for interventions to increase physical activity participation. The widely\u2010accepted benefits of physical activity, coupled with the increasing availability of wearable monitoring devices to objectively measure participation, has led to a dramatic rise in the number and variety of studies that aimed to improve the physical activity of people with COPD. However, little was known about the relative efficacy of interventions tested so far. \nObjectives\nIn people with COPD, which interventions are effective at improving objectively\u2010assessed physical activity? \nSearch methods\nWe identified trials from the Cochrane Airways Trials Register Register, which contains records identified from bibliographic databases including the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, AMED, and PsycINFO. We also searched PEDro, ClinicalTrials.gov, the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform portal and the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry (from inception to June 2019). We checked reference lists of all primary studies and review articles for additional references, as well as respiratory journals and respiratory meeting abstracts, to identify relevant studies. \nSelection criteria\nWe included randomised controlled trials of interventions that used objective measures for the assessment of physical activity in people with COPD. Trials compared an intervention with no intervention or a sham/placebo intervention, an intervention in addition to another standard intervention common to both groups, or two different interventions. \nData collection and analysis\nWe used standard methods recommended by Cochrane. Subgroup analyses were possible for supervised compared to unsupervised pulmonary rehabilitation programmes in clinically\u2010stable COPD for a range of physical activity outcomes. Secondary outcomes were health\u2010related quality of life, exercise capacity, adverse events and adherence. Insufficient data were available to perform prespecified subgroup analyses by duration of intervention or disease severity. We undertook sensitivity analyses by removing studies that were at high or unclear risk of bias for the domains of blinding and incomplete outcome data. \nMain results\nWe included 76 studies with 8018 participants. Most studies were funded by government bodies, although some were sponsored by equipment or drug manufacturers. Only 38 studies had physical activity as a primary outcome. A diverse range of interventions have been assessed, primarily in single studies, but improvements have not been systematically demonstrated following any particular interventions. Where improvements were demonstrated, results were confined to single studies, or data for maintained improvement were not provided. Step count was the most frequently reported outcome, but it was commonly assessed using devices with documented inaccuracy for this variable. \nCompared to no intervention, the mean difference (MD) in time in moderate\u2010 to vigorous\u2010intensity physical activity (MVPA) following pulmonary rehabilitation was four minutes per day (95% confidence interval (CI) \u22122 to 9; 3 studies, 190 participants; low\u2010certainty evidence). An improvement was demonstrated following high\u2010intensity interval exercise training (6 minutes per day, 95% CI 4 to 8; 2 studies, 275 participants; moderate\u2010certainty evidence). One study demonstrated an improvement following six months of physical activity counselling (MD 11 minutes per day, 95% CI 7 to 15; 1 study, 280 participants; moderate\u2010certainty evidence), but we found mixed results for the addition of physical activity counselling to pulmonary rehabilitation. There was an improvement following three to four weeks of pharmacological treatment with long\u2010acting muscarinic antagonist and long\u2010acting beta2\u2010agonist (LAMA/LABA) compared to placebo (MD 10 minutes per day, 95% CI 4 to 15; 2 studies, 423 participants; high\u2010certainty evidence). These interventions also demonstrated improvements in other measures of physical activity. \nOther interventions included self\u2010management strategies, nutritional supplementation, supplemental oxygen, endobronchial valve surgery, non\u2010invasive ventilation, neuromuscular electrical stimulation and inspiratory muscle training. \nAuthors' conclusions\nA diverse range of interventions have been assessed, primarily in single studies. Improvements in physical activity have not been systematically demonstrated following any particular intervention. There was limited evidence for improvement in physical activity with strategies including exercise training, physical activity counselling and pharmacological management. The optimal timing, components, duration and models for interventions are still unclear. Assessment of quality was limited by a lack of methodological detail. There was scant evidence for a continued effect over time following completion of interventions, a likely requirement for meaningful health benefits for people with COPD. \n", "10.1002-14651858.CD010382.pub2-abstract.txt": "Background\nChildren with severe global developmental delay (SGDD) have significant intellectual disability and severe motor impairment; they are extremely limited in their functional movement and are dependent upon others for all activities of daily living. SGDD does not directly cause lung dysfunction, but the combination of immobility, weakness, skeletal deformity and parenchymal damage from aspiration can lead to significant prevalence of respiratory illness. Respiratory pathology is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality for children with SGDD; it can result in frequent hospital admissions and impacts upon quality of life. Although many treatment approaches are available, there currently exists no comprehensive review of the literature to inform best practice. A broad range of treatment options exist; to focus the scope of this review and allow in\u2010depth analysis, we have excluded pharmaceutical interventions. \nObjectives\nTo assess the effects of non\u2010pharmaceutical treatment modalities for the management of respiratory morbidity in children with severe global developmental delay. \nSearch methods\nWe conducted comprehensive searches of the following databases from inception to November 2013: the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Allied and Complementary Medicine Database (AMED) and the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL). We searched the Web of Science and clinical trials registries for grey literature and for planned, ongoing and unpublished trials. We checked the reference lists of all primary included studies for additional relevant references. \nWe updated searches in November 2019 and July 2020 and added six studies to awaiting classification, but these results have not been fully incorporated into the review. \nSelection criteria\nRandomised controlled trials, controlled trials and cohort studies of children up to 18 years of age with a diagnosis of severe neurological impairment and respiratory morbidity were included. Studies of airways clearance techniques, suction, assisted coughing, non\u2010invasive ventilation, tracheostomy and postural management were eligible for inclusion. \nData collection and analysis\nWe used standard methodological procedures as expected by The Cochrane Collaboration. As the result of heterogeneity, we could not perform meta\u2010analysis. We have therefore presented our results using a narrative approach. \nMain results\nFifteen studies were included in the review. Studies included children with a range of severe neurological impairments in differing settings, for example, home and critical care. Several different treatment modalities were assessed, and a wide range of outcome measures were used. Most studies used a non\u2010randomised design and included small sample groups. Only four randomised controlled trials were identified. Non\u2010randomised design, lack of information about how participants were selected and who completed outcome measures and incomplete reporting led to high or unclear risk of bias in many studies. Results from low\u2010quality studies suggest that use of non\u2010invasive ventilation, mechanically assisted coughing, high\u2010frequency chest wall oscillation (HFCWO), positive expiratory pressure and supportive seating may confer potential benefits. No serious adverse effects were reported for ventilatory support or airway clearance interventions other than one incident in a clinically unstable child following mechanically assisted coughing. Night\u2010time positioning equipment and spinal bracing were shown to have a potentially negative effect for some participants. However, these findings must be considered as tentative and require testing in future randomised trials. \nAuthors' conclusions\nThis review found no high\u2010quality evidence for any single intervention for the management of respiratory morbidity in children with severe global developmental delay. Our search yielded data on a wide range of interventions of interest. Significant differences in study design and in outcome measures precluded the possibility of meta\u2010analysis. No conclusions on efficacy or safety of interventions for respiratory morbidity in children with severe global developmental delay can be made based upon the findings of this review. \nA co\u2010ordinated approach to future research is vital to ensure that high\u2010quality evidence becomes available to guide treatment for this vulnerable patient group. \n", "10.1002-14651858.CD006297.pub2-abstract.txt": "Background\nDiabetes mellitus type 1 is a chronic disease with short and long term complications.

Data were extracted and analysed accordingly.\nMain results\nTwenty\u2010three randomised controlled trials were identified. A total of 3872 and 2915 participants in the intervention and in the control group, respectively, were analysed.

The WMD between the groups in fasting plasma and blood glucose levels was \u20100.63 (95% CI \u20100.86 to \u20100.40) and \u20100.86 (95% CI \u20101.00 to \u20100.72) in favour of the long acting insulins. The odds ratio for a patient on long acting insulin to develop any type of hypoglycaemia was 0.93 (95% CI 0.8 to 1.08) compared to that of a patient on intermediate acting insulins. The OR for severe hypoglycaemic episodes was 0.73 (95% CI 0.61 to 0.87), and 0.70 (95% CI of 0.63 to 0.79) for nocturnal episodes. The WMD between the long and intermediate insulin groups for hypoglycaemic events per 100 patient follow up days was \u20100.77 (95% CI \u20100.89 to \u20100.65), \u20100.0 (95% CI \u20100.02 to 0.02) and \u20100.40 (95% CI \u20100.45 to \u20100.34) for overall, severe, and nocturnal hypoglycaemic episodes. Weight gain was more prominent in the control group. No difference was noted in the quantity or quality of severe adverse events or deaths. \nAuthors' conclusions\nLong acting insulin preparations seem to exert a beneficial effect on nocturnal glucose levels. Their effect on the overall diabetes control is clinically unremarkable. Their use as a basal insulin regimen for type 1 diabetes mellitus warrants further substantiation. \n", "10.1002-14651858.CD003315.pub3-abstract.txt": "Background\nCleft lip and cleft palate are common birth defects, affecting about one baby of every 700 born.

No statistically significant differences were shown for any of the primary outcomes when comparing bottle types, although squeezable bottles were less likely to require modification.

Possible approaches to reduce the exposure to toxins from smoking include reducing the amount of tobacco used, and using less toxic products, such as pharmaceutical, nicotine and potential reduced\u2010exposure tobacco products (PREPs), as an alternative to cigarettes. \nObjectives\nTo assess the effects of interventions intended to reduce the harm to health of continued tobacco use, we considered the following specific questions: do interventions intended to reduce harm have an effect on long\u2010term health status?; do they lead to a reduction in the number of cigarettes smoked?; do they have an effect on smoking abstinence?; do they have an effect on biomarkers of tobacco exposure?; and do they have an effect on biomarkers of damage caused by tobacco? \nSearch methods\nWe searched the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Group Trials Register (CRS) on the 21st October 2015, using free\u2010text and MeSH terms for harm reduction, smoking reduction and cigarette reduction. \nSelection criteria\nRandomized or quasi\u2010randomized controlled trials of interventions to reduce the amount smoked, or to reduce harm from smoking by means other than cessation. We include studies carried out in smokers with no immediate desire to quit all tobacco use. Primary outcomes were change in cigarette consumption, smoking cessation and any markers of damage or benefit to health, measured at least six months from the start of the intervention. \nData collection and analysis\nWe assessed study eligibility for inclusion using standard Cochrane methods. We pooled trials with similar interventions and outcomes (> 50% reduction in cigarettes a day (CPD) and long\u2010term smoking abstinence), using fixed\u2010effect models. Where it was not possible to meta\u2010analyse data, we summarized findings narratively. \nMain results\nTwenty\u2010four trials evaluated interventions to help those who smoke to cut down the amount smoked or to replace their regular cigarettes with PREPs, compared to placebo, brief intervention, or a comparison intervention. None of these trials directly tested whether harm reduction strategies reduced the harms to health caused by smoking. Most trials (14/24) tested nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) as an intervention to assist reduction. In a pooled analysis of eight trials, NRT significantly increased the likelihood of reducing CPD by at least 50% for people using nicotine gum or inhaler or a choice of product compared to placebo (risk ratio (RR) 1.75, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.44 to 2.13; 3081 participants). Where average changes from baseline were compared for different measures, carbon monoxide (CO) and cotinine generally showed smaller reductions than CPD. Use of NRT versus placebo also significantly increased the likelihood of ultimately quitting smoking (RR 1.87, 95% CI 1.43 to 2.44; 8 trials, 3081 participants; quality of the evidence: low). Two trials comparing NRT and behavioural support to brief advice found a significant effect on reduction, but no significant effect on cessation. We found one trial investigating each of the following harm reduction intervention aids: bupropion, varenicline, electronic cigarettes, snus, plus another of nicotine patches to facilitate temporary abstinence. The evidence for all five intervention types was therefore imprecise, and it is unclear whether or not these aids increase the likelihood of smoking reduction or cessation. Two trials investigating two different types of behavioural advice and instructions on reducing CPD also provided imprecise evidence. Therefore, the evidence base for this comparison is inadequate to support the use of these types of behavioural advice to reduce smoking. Four studies of PREPs (cigarettes with reduced levels of tar, carbon and nicotine, and in one case delivered using an electronically\u2010heated cigarette smoking system) showed some reduction in exposure to some toxicants, but it is unclear whether this would substantially alter the risk of harm. We judged the included studies to be generally at a low or unclear risk of bias; however, there were some ratings of high risk, due to a lack of blinding and the potential for detection bias. Using the GRADE system, we rated the overall quality of the evidence for our cessation outcomes as \u2018low\u2019 or \u2018very low\u2019, due to imprecision and indirectness. A \u2018low\u2019 grade means that further research is very likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and is likely to change the estimate. A \u2018very low\u2019 grade means we are very uncertain about the estimate. \nAuthors' conclusions\nPeople who do not wish to quit can be helped to cut down the number of cigarettes they smoke and to quit smoking in the long term, using NRT, despite original intentions not to do so. However, we rated the evidence contributing to the cessation outcome for NRT as 'low' by GRADE standards. There is a lack of evidence to support the use of other harm reduction aids to reduce the harm caused by continued tobacco smoking. This could simply be due to the lack of high\u2010quality studies (our confidence in cessation outcomes for these aids is rated 'low' or 'very low' due to imprecision by GRADE standards), meaning that we may have missed a worthwhile effect, or due to a lack of effect on reduction or quit rates. It is therefore important that more high\u2010quality RCTs are conducted, and that these also measure the long\u2010term health effects of treatments. \n", "10.1002-14651858.CD006237.pub4-abstract.txt": "Background\nWork disability such as sickness absence is common in people with depression.\nObjectives\nTo evaluate the effectiveness of interventions aimed at reducing work disability in employees with depressive disorders. \nSearch methods\nWe searched CENTRAL (The Cochrane Library), MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, and PsycINFO until April 4th 2020. \nSelection criteria\nWe included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and cluster\u2010RCTs of work\u2010directed and clinical interventions for depressed people that included\u00a0sickness absence days\u00a0or being off work\u00a0as an outcome. We also analysed the effects on depression and work functioning. \nData collection and analysis\nTwo review authors independently extracted the data and rated the certainty of the evidence using GRADE.\u00a0We used standardised mean differences (SMDs) or risk ratios (RR)\u00a0with 95% confidence intervals (CI) to pool study results in studies we judged to be sufficiently similar.\u00a0 \nMain results\nIn this update, we added 23 new studies. In total, we included 45 studies with 88 study arms, involving 12,109 participants with either a major depressive disorder or a high level of depressive symptoms. \nRisk of bias \nThe most common types of bias risk were detection bias (27 studies) and attrition bias (22 studies), both for the outcome of sickness absence. \nWork\u2010directed interventions \nWork\u2010directed interventionscombined with clinical interventions \nA combination of a work\u2010directed intervention and a clinical intervention probably reduces\u00a0sickness absence days within the first year of follow\u2010up (SMD \u20100.25, 95% CI \u20100.38 to \u20100.12; 9 studies; moderate\u2010certainty evidence). This translates back to 0.5 fewer (95% CI \u20100.7 to \u20100.2) sick leave days in the past two weeks or\u00a025 fewer days during one year (95% CI \u201037.5 to \u201011.8). The intervention does not lead to fewer persons being off work\u00a0beyond one year follow\u2010up (RR 1.08, 95% CI 0.64 to 1.83; 2 studies, high\u2010certainty evidence).\u00a0The intervention\u00a0may reduce depressive symptoms\u00a0(SMD \u20100.25, 95% CI \u20100.49 to \u20100.01; 8 studies, low\u2010certainty evidence) and probably has a small\u00a0effect on work functioning (SMD \u20100.19, 95% CI \u20100.42 to 0.06; 5 studies, moderate\u2010certainty evidence) within the first year of follow\u2010up.\u00a0 \nStand alone work\u2010directed interventions \nA specific work\u2010directed intervention alone may increase the number of sickness absence days compared with work\u2010directed care as usual\u00a0(SMD 0.39, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.74; 2 studies, low\u2010certainty evidence) but probably does not lead to more people\u00a0being off work within the first year of follow\u2010up (RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.11; 1 study, moderate\u2010certainty evidence) or beyond (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.22; 2 studies, moderate\u2010certainty evidence). There is probably no effect on depressive symptoms (SMD \u20100.10, 95% \u20100.30 CI to 0.10; 4 studies, moderate\u2010certainty evidence) within the first year of follow\u2010up and there may be no effect on depressive symptoms beyond that time (SMD 0.18, 95% CI \u20100.13 to 0.49; 1 study, low\u2010certainty evidence). The intervention may also not lead to better work functioning (SMD \u20100.32, 95% CI \u20100.90 to 0.26; 1 study, low\u2010certainty evidence) within the first year of follow\u2010up. \u00a0 \nPsychological interventions \nA psychological intervention, either face\u2010to\u2010face, or an E\u2010mental health intervention, with or without professional guidance, may reduce the number of\u00a0sickness absence\u00a0days, compared with care as usual (SMD \u20100.15, 95% CI \u20100.28 to \u20100.03; 9 studies, low\u2010certainty evidence).\u00a0It may also reduce depressive symptoms (SMD \u20100.30, 95% CI \u20100.45 to \u20100.15, 8 studies, low\u2010certainty evidence). We are uncertain whether these psychological interventions improve work ability (SMD \u20100.15 95% CI \u20100.46 to 0.57; 1 study; very low\u2010certainty evidence). \nPsychological interventioncombined with antidepressant medication \nTwo studies compared the effect of a psychological intervention combined with antidepressants to antidepressants alone. One study combined psychodynamic therapy with tricyclic antidepressant (TCA) medication and another combined telephone\u2010administered cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) with a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI). We are uncertain if\u00a0this intervention reduces the number of sickness absence days (SMD \u20100.38, 95% CI \u20100.99 to 0.24; 2 studies, very low\u2010certainty evidence) but found that there may be no effect on depressive symptoms (SMD \u20100.19, 95% CI \u20100.50 to 0.12;\u00a02 studies,\u00a0low\u2010certainty evidence). \nAntidepressant medication only \nThree studies compared the effectiveness of SSRI to selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI) medication on reducing sickness absence and yielded highly inconsistent results. \nImproved care \nOverall, interventions to improve care did not lead to fewer sickness absence days, compared to care as usual (SMD \u20100.05, 95% CI \u20100.16 to 0.06; 7 studies, moderate\u2010certainty evidence). However, in studies with a low risk of bias, the intervention probably leads to fewer sickness absence days in the first year of follow\u2010up\u00a0(SMD \u20100.20, 95% CI \u20100.35 to \u20100.05; 2 studies; moderate\u2010certainty evidence). Improved care probably leads to fewer depressive symptoms (SMD \u20100.21, 95% CI \u20100.35 to \u20100.07; 7 studies, moderate\u2010certainty evidence) but may possibly lead to a decrease in work\u2010functioning (SMD 0.5, 95% CI 0.34 to 0.66; 1 study; moderate\u2010certainty evidence). \nExercise \nSupervised strength exercise may reduce sickness absence, compared to relaxation (SMD \u20101.11; 95% CI \u20101.68 to \u20100.54; one study, low\u2010certainty evidence). However, aerobic exercise probably is not more effective than relaxation or stretching (SMD \u20100.06; 95% CI \u20100.36 to 0.24; 2 studies, moderate\u2010certainty evidence). Both studies found no differences between the two conditions in depressive symptoms. \nAuthors' conclusions\nA combination of a work\u2010directed intervention and a clinical intervention probably reduces the number of\u00a0sickness absence days, but at the end of one year or longer follow\u2010up, this does not lead to more people in the intervention group being at work. The intervention may also reduce depressive symptoms and probably increases work functioning\u00a0more than care as usual. Specific work\u2010directed interventions may not be more effective than usual work\u2010directed care alone. Psychological interventions may reduce the number of\u00a0sickness absence days, compared with care as usual. Interventions to improve clinical care probably lead to lower sickness absence and lower levels of depression, compared with care as usual. There was no evidence of a difference in effect on sickness absence of one antidepressant medication compared to another. Further research is needed to assess which combination of work\u2010directed and clinical interventions works best. \n", "10.1002-14651858.CD014877.pub2-abstract.txt": "Background\nProgrammes that introduce rapid molecular tests for tuberculosis and tuberculosis drug resistance aim to bring tests closer to the community,\u00a0and thereby cut delay in diagnosis, ensure early treatment, and improve health outcomes, as well as overcome problems with poor laboratory infrastructure and inadequately trained personnel. Yet, diagnostic technologies only have an impact if they are put to use in a correct and timely manner. Views of the intended beneficiaries are important in uptake of diagnostics, and their effective use also depends on those implementing testing programmes, including providers, laboratory professionals, and staff in health ministries. Otherwise, there is a risk these technologies will not fit their intended use and setting, cannot be made to work and scale up, and are not used by, or not accessible to, those in need. \nObjectives\nTo synthesize end\u2010user and professional user perspectives and experiences with low\u2010complexity nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) for detection of tuberculosis and tuberculosis drug resistance; and to identify implications for effective implementation and health equity. \nSearch methods\nWe searched MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, PsycInfo and Science Citation Index Expanded databases for eligible studies from 1 January 2007 up to 20 October 2021. We limited all searches to 2007 onward because the development of Xpert MTB/RIF, the first rapid molecular test in this review, was completed in 2009. \nSelection criteria\nWe included studies that used qualitative methods for data collection and analysis, and were focused on perspectives and experiences of users and potential users of low\u2010complexity NAATs to diagnose tuberculosis and drug\u2010resistant tuberculosis. NAATs included Xpert MTB/RIF, Xpert MTB/RIF Ultra, Xpert MTB/XDR, and the Truenat assays. Users were people with presumptive or confirmed tuberculosis and drug\u2010resistant tuberculosis (including multidrug\u2010resistant (MDR\u2010TB)) and their caregivers, healthcare providers, laboratory technicians and managers, and programme officers and staff; and were from any type of health facility and setting globally. MDR\u2010TB is tuberculosis caused by resistance to at least rifampicin and isoniazid, the two most effective first\u2010line drugs used to treat tuberculosis. \nData collection and analysis\nWe used a thematic analysis approach for data extraction and synthesis, and assessed confidence in the findings using GRADE CERQual approach. We developed a conceptual framework to illustrate how the findings relate. \nMain results\nWe found 32 studies. All studies were conducted in low\u2010 and middle\u2010income countries. Twenty\u2010seven studies were conducted in high\u2010tuberculosis burden countries and 21 studies in high\u2010MDR\u2010TB burden countries. Only one study was from an Eastern European country.\u00a0While the studies covered a diverse use of low\u2010complexity NAATs, in only a minority of studies was it used as the initial diagnostic test for all people with presumptive tuberculosis. \nWe identified 18 review findings and grouped them into three overarching categories.\nCritical aspects users value \nPeople with tuberculosis valued reaching diagnostic closure with an accurate diagnosis, avoiding diagnostic delays, and keeping diagnostic\u2010associated cost low. Similarly, healthcare providers valued aspects of accuracy and the resulting confidence in low\u2010complexity NAAT results, rapid turnaround times, and keeping cost to people seeking a diagnosis low. In addition, providers valued diversity of sample types (for example, gastric aspirate specimens and stool in children) and drug resistance information. Laboratory professionals appreciated the improved ease of use, ergonomics, and biosafety of low\u2010complexity NAATs compared to sputum microscopy, and increased staff satisfaction. \nChallenges reported to realizing those values \nPeople with tuberculosis and healthcare workers were reluctant to test for tuberculosis (including MDR\u2010TB) due to fears, stigma, or cost concerns. Thus, low\u2010complexity NAAT testing is not implemented with sufficient support or discretion to overcome barriers that are common to other approaches to testing for tuberculosis. Delays were reported at many steps of the diagnostic pathway owing to poor sample quality; difficulties with transporting specimens; lack of sufficient resources; maintenance of low\u2010complexity NAATs; increased workload; inefficient work and patient flows; over\u2010reliance on low\u2010complexity NAAT results in lieu of clinical judgement; and lack of data\u2010driven and inclusive implementation processes. These challenges were reported to lead to underutilization.\u00a0 \nConcerns for access and equity \nThe reported concerns included sustainable funding and maintenance and equitable use of resources to access low\u2010complexity NAATs, as well as conflicts of interest between donors and people implementing the tests. Also, lengthy diagnostic delays, underutilization of low\u2010complexity NAATs, lack of tuberculosis diagnostic facilities in the community, and too many eligibility restrictions hampered access to prompt and accurate testing and treatment. This was particularly the case for vulnerable groups, such as children, people with MDR\u2010TB, or people with limited ability to pay. \nWe had high confidence in most of our findings.\nAuthors' conclusions\nLow\u2010complexity diagnostics have been presented as a solution to overcome deficiencies in laboratory infrastructure and lack of skilled professionals. This review indicates this is misleading. The lack of infrastructure and human resources undermine the added value new diagnostics of low complexity have for recipients and providers. We had high confidence in the evidence contributing to these review findings. \nImplementation of new diagnostic technologies, like those considered in this review, will need to tackle the challenges identified in this review including weak infrastructure and systems, and insufficient data on ground level realities prior and during implementation, as well as problems of conflicts of interest in order to ensure equitable use of resources. \n", "10.1002-14651858.CD006487.pub2-abstract.txt": "Background\nPain during dental treatment, which is a common fear of patients, can be controlled successfully by local anaesthetic. Several different local anaesthetic formulations and techniques are available to dentists. \nObjectives\nOur primary objectives were to compare the success of anaesthesia, the speed of onset and duration of anaesthesia, and systemic and local adverse effects amongst different local anaesthetic formulations for dental anaesthesia. We define success of anaesthesia as absence of pain during a dental procedure, or a negative response to electric pulp testing or other simulated scenario tests.

Mass media interventions are commonly used to encourage healthier behaviours in population groups. It is unclear whether targeted mass media interventions for ethnic minority groups are more or less effective in changing behaviours than those developed for the general population. \nObjectives\nTo determine the effects of mass media interventions targeting adult ethnic minorities with messages about physical activity, dietary patterns, tobacco use or alcohol consumption to reduce the risk of NCDs. \nSearch methods\nWe searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL, ERIC, SweMed+, and ISI Web of Science until August 2016. We also searched for grey literature in OpenGrey, Grey Literature Report, Eldis, and two relevant websites until October 2016. The searches were not restricted by language. \nSelection criteria\nWe searched for individual and cluster\u2010randomised controlled trials, controlled before\u2010and\u2010after studies (CBA) and interrupted time series studies (ITS). Relevant interventions promoted healthier behaviours related to physical activity, dietary patterns, tobacco use or alcohol consumption; were disseminated via mass media channels; and targeted ethnic minority groups. The population of interest comprised adults (\u2265 18 years) from ethnic minority groups in the focal countries. Primary outcomes included indicators of behavioural change, self\u2010reported behavioural change and knowledge and attitudes towards change. Secondary outcomes were the use of health promotion services and costs related to the project. \nData collection and analysis\nTwo authors independently reviewed the references to identify studies for inclusion. We extracted data and assessed the risk of bias in all included studies. We did not pool the results due to heterogeneity in comparisons made, outcomes, and study designs. We describe the results narratively and present them in 'Summary of findings' tables. We judged the quality of the evidence using the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation) methodology. \nMain results\nSix studies met the inclusion criteria, including three RCTs, two cluster\u2010RCTs and one ITS. All were conducted in the USA and comprised targeted mass media interventions for people of African descent (four studies), Spanish\u2010language dominant Latino immigrants (one study), and Chinese immigrants (one study). The two latter studies offered the intervention in the participants\u2019 first language (Spanish, Cantonese, or Mandarin). Three interventions targeted towards women only, one pregnant women specifically. We judged all studies as being at unclear risk of bias in at least one domain and three studies as being at high risk of bias in at least one domain. \nWe categorised the findings into three comparisons. The first comparison examined mass media interventions targeted at ethnic minorities versus an equivalent mass media intervention intended for the general population. The one study in this category (255 participants of African decent) found little or no difference in effect on self\u2010reported behavioural change for smoking and only small differences in attitudes to change between participants who were given a culturally specific smoking cessation booklet versus a booklet intended for the general population. We are uncertain about the effect estimates, as assessed by the GRADE methodology (very low quality evidence of effect). No study provided data for indicators of behavioural change or adverse effects. \nThe second comparison assessed targeted mass media interventions versus no intervention. One study (154 participants of African decent) reported effects for our primary outcomes. Participants in the intervention group had access to 12 one\u2010hour live programmes on cable TV and received print material over three months regarding nutrition and physical activity to improve health and weight control. Change in body mass index (BMI) was comparable between groups 12 months after the baseline (low quality evidence). Scores on a food habits (fat behaviours) and total leisure activity scores changed favourably for the intervention group (very low quality evidence). Two other studies exposed entire populations in geographical areas to radio advertisements targeted towards African American communities. Authors presented effects on two of our secondary outcomes, use of health promotion services and project costs. The campaign message was to call smoking quit lines. The outcome was the number of calls received. After one year, one study reported 18 calls per estimated 10,000 targeted smokers from the intervention communities (estimated target population 310,500 persons), compared to 0.2 calls per estimated 10,000 targeted smokers from the control communities (estimated target population 331,400 persons) (moderate quality evidence). The ITS study also reported an increase in the number of calls from the target population during campaigns (low quality evidence). The proportion of African American callers increased in both studies (low to very low quality evidence). No study provided data on knowledge and attitudes for change and adverse effects. Information on costs were sparse. \nThe third comparison assessed targeted mass media interventions versus a mass media intervention plus personalised content. Findings are based on three studies (1361 participants). Participants in these comparison groups received personal feedback. Two of the studies recorded weight changes over time. Neither found significant differences between the groups (low quality evidence). Evidence on behavioural changes, and knowledge and attitudes typically found some effects in favour of receiving personalised content or no significant differences between groups (very low quality evidence). No study provided data on adverse effects. Information on costs were sparse. \nAuthors' conclusions\nThe available evidence is inadequate for understanding whether mass media interventions targeted toward ethnic minority populations are more effective in changing health behaviours than mass media interventions intended for the population at large. When compared to no intervention, a targeted mass media intervention may increase the number of calls to smoking quit line, but the effect on health behaviours is unclear. These studies could not distinguish the impact of different components, for instance the effect of hearing a message regarding behavioural change, the cultural adaptation to the ethnic minority group, or increase reach to the target group through more appropriate mass media channels. New studies should explore targeted interventions for ethnic minorities with a first language other than the dominant language in their resident country, as well as directly compare targeted versus general population mass media interventions. \n", "10.1002-14651858.CD013400.pub2-abstract.txt": "Background\nCongenital heart disease (ConHD) affects\u00a0approximately 1% of all live births. People with ConHD are living longer due to improved medical intervention and are at risk of developing non\u2010communicable diseases. Cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) is reduced in people with ConHD, who deteriorate\u00a0faster compared to healthy people. CRF is known to be prognostic of future mortality and morbidity: it\u00a0is\u00a0therefore\u00a0important to assess the evidence base on physical activity interventions in this population to inform decision making. \nObjectives\nTo assess the effectiveness and safety of all types of physical activity interventions versus\u00a0standard care\u00a0in individuals with congenital heart disease. \nSearch methods\nWe undertook a\u00a0systematic\u00a0search on\u00a023\u00a0September 2019 of the following databases: CENTRAL,\u00a0MEDLINE, Embase,\u00a0CINAHL, AMED, BIOSIS Citation Index,\u00a0Web of Science Core Collection, LILACS and\u00a0DARE. We also searched ClinicalTrials.gov and we\u00a0reviewed the reference lists of relevant systematic reviews. \nSelection criteria\nWe included\u00a0randomised controlled trials\u00a0(RCT) that compared any type of physical activity intervention against a 'no physical activity' (usual care) control. We included all individuals\u00a0with a diagnosis of\u00a0congenital heart disease, regardless of age or previous medical interventions.\u00a0 \nData collection and analysis\nTwo review authors (CAW and CW)\u00a0independently screened all the identified references for inclusion. We retrieved and read all full papers; and we contacted study authors if we needed any further information. The same two independent reviewers who\u00a0extracted the data then\u00a0processed the included papers, assessed their risk of bias using RoB 2\u00a0and assessed the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach.\u00a0The primary outcomes were: maximal cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) assessed by\u00a0peak oxygen consumption; health\u2010related quality of life (HRQoL) determined by a validated questionnaire; and device\u2010worn \u2018objective\u2019 measures of physical activity. \nMain results\nWe included 15\u00a0RCTs\u00a0with 924\u00a0participants\u00a0in the review. The median intervention length/follow\u2010up length was 12 weeks (12 to 26 interquartile range (IQR)).\u00a0There were five RCTs of children and adolescents (n = 500) and 10 adult RCTs (n = 424). We identified three types of intervention: physical activity promotion; exercise training; and inspiratory muscle training. We assessed the risk of bias of results for CRF as either being of some concern (n = 12) or at\u00a0a high risk of bias (n\u00a0=\u00a02), due to a\u00a0failure to blind\u00a0intervention staff. One study did not report this outcome. Using the GRADE method, we assessed the certainty of evidence as moderate to very low across measured outcomes. \nWhen we pooled all types of interventions (physical activity promotion, exercise training and inspiratory muscle training), compared to a 'no\u00a0exercise' control\u00a0CRF may slightly increase, with a\u00a0mean difference (MD) of 1.89 mL.kg\u22121.min\u22121 (95% CI \u22120.22 to\u00a03.99; n = 732; moderate\u2010certainty evidence).\u00a0The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of physical activity and exercise interventions on HRQoL. There was a standardised mean difference (SMD) of 0.76\u00a0(95% CI \u22120.13 to 1.65;\u00a0n = 163; very low certainty evidence) in HRQoL. However, we could pool only three\u00a0studies in a meta\u2010analysis, due to different ways of reporting. Only one study out of eight showed a positive effect on HRQoL. There may be a small improvement in mean daily physical activity (PA) (SMD 0.38,\u00a095% CI \u22120.15 to\u00a00.92; n = 328; low\u2010certainty evidence), which equates to\u00a0approximately an additional 10 minutes of physical activity daily (95% CI \u22122.50 to\u00a022.20). \nPhysical activity and exercise interventions likely result in an increase in submaximal cardiorespiratory fitness (assessed with VO2\u00a0mL.kg\u20101.min\u20101 at the gas exchange threshold; MD 2.05,\u00a095% CI 0.05 to 4.05; n = 179; moderate\u2010certainty evidence). Physical activity and exercise interventions likely increase muscular strength (measured by maximal voluntary contraction\u00a0of\u00a0knee extensions; MD 17.13, 95% CI 3.45 to 30.81; n = 18; moderate\u2010certainty evidence).\u00a0Eleven studies (n = 501) reported on the outcome of adverse events (73% of total studies). Of the 11 studies, six\u00a0studies reported zero\u00a0adverse events. Five\u00a0studies reported a total of 11 adverse events; 36% of adverse events were cardiac related\u00a0(n\u00a0= 4); there were, however, no serious adverse events\u00a0related to the interventions or reported\u00a0fatalities (moderate\u2010certainty evidence).\u00a0No studies reported hospital admissions. \nAuthors' conclusions\nThis review summarises the latest evidence on CRF, HRQoL and PA. Although there were only small improvements in CRF and PA, and small to no\u00a0improvements in HRQoL, there were no reported serious\u00a0adverse events related to the interventions. Although these data are promising, there is currently\u00a0insufficient evidence to definitively determine the impact of physical activity\u00a0interventions in ConHD.

Continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) is a blood purification technique used to treat the most severe forms of AKI but its effectiveness remains unclear. \nObjectives\nTo assess the effects of different intensities (intensive and less intensive) of CRRT on mortality and recovery of kidney function in critically ill AKI patients. \nSearch methods\nWe searched Cochrane Kidney and Transplant's Specialised Register to 9 February 2016 through contact with the Information Specialist using search terms relevant to this review. Studies contained in the Specialised Register are identified through search strategies specifically designed for CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and EMBASE; handsearching conference proceedings; and searching the International Clinical Trials Register (ICTRP) Search Portal and ClinicalTrials.gov. We also searched LILACS to 9 February 2016. \nSelection criteria\nWe included all randomised controlled trials (RCTs). We included all patients with AKI in ICU regardless of age, comparing intensive (usually a prescribed dose \u226535 mL/kg/h) versus less intensive CRRT (usually a prescribed dose < 35 mL/kg/h). For safety and cost outcomes we planned to include cohort studies and non\u2010RCTs. \nData collection and analysis\nData were extracted independently by two authors. The random\u2010effects model was used and results were reported as risk ratios (RR) for dichotomous outcomes and mean differences (MD) for continuous outcomes, with 95% confidence intervals (CI). \nMain results\nWe included six studies enrolling 3185 participants. Studies were assessed as being at low or unclear risk of bias. There was no significant difference between intensive versus less intensive CRRT on mortality risk at day 30 (5 studies, 2402 participants: RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.08; I2 = 75%; low quality of evidence) or after 30 days post randomisation (5 studies, 2759 participants: RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.06; I2 = 65%; low quality of evidence). There were no significant differences between intensive versus less intensive CRRT in the numbers of patients who were free of RRT after CRRT discontinuation (5 studies, 2402 participants: RR 1.12, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.37; I2 = 71%; low quality of evidence) or among survivors at day 30 (5 studies, 1415 participants: RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.11; I2 = 69%; low quality of evidence) and day 90 (3 studies, 988 participants: RR 0.98, IC 95% 0.94 to 1.01, I2 = 0%; moderatequality of evidence). There were no significant differences between intensive and less intensive CRRT on the number of days in hospital (2 studies, 1665 participants): MD \u20100.23 days, 95% CI \u20103.35 to 2.89; I2 = 8%; low quality of evidence) and the number of days in ICU (2 studies, 1665 participants: MD \u20100.58 days, 95% CI \u20103.73 to 2.56, I2 = 19%; low quality of evidence). Intensive CRRT increased the risk of hypophosphataemia (1 study, 1441 participants: RR 1.21, 95% CI 1.11 to 1.31; high quality evidence) compared to less intensive CRRT. There was no significant differences between intensive and less intensive CRRT on numbers of patients who experienced adverse events (3 studies, 1753 participants: RR 1.08, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.61; I2 = 16%; moderate quality of evidence). In the subgroups analysis by severity of illness and by aetiology of AKI, intensive CRRT would seem to reduce the risk mortality (2 studies, 531 participants: RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.61 to 0.88; I2 = 0%; high quality of evidence) only in the subgroup of patients with post\u2010surgical AKI. \nAuthors' conclusions\nBased on the current low quality of evidence identified, more intensive CRRT did not demonstrate beneficial effects on mortality or recovery of kidney function in critically ill patients with AKI. There was an increased risk of hypophosphataemia with more intense CRRT. Intensive CRRT reduced the risk of mortality in patients with post\u2010surgical AKI. \n", "10.1002-14651858.CD009359.pub2-abstract.txt": "Background\nAcute diarrhoea is a leading cause of death for children under five years of age. Most deaths are caused by excessive fluid and electrolyte losses. Racecadotril is an anti\u2010secretory drug that has been used for acute diarrhoea in children as an adjunct to oral rehydration therapy. \nObjectives\nTo assess the efficacy and safety of racecadotril for treating acute diarrhoea in children under five years of age. \nSearch methods\nWe searched the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group Specialized Register; the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, published in the Cochrane Library Issue 3, March 2019); MEDLINE; Embase; LILACS; ClinicalTrials.gov; and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (WHO ICTRP), up to 4 March 2019, for clinical trials regardless of publication language or status. \nSelection criteria\nRandomized controlled trials (RCTs) that compared racecadotril to placebo or no intervention in addition to standard care (oral rehydration therapy) in children under five with acute diarrhoea. The primary outcomes were failure of oral rehydration, duration of diarrhoea, and number of stools. The secondary outcomes were stool output, length of the hospital stay, and adverse events. \nData collection and analysis\nTwo review authors independently assessed trial eligibility, extracted the data and assessed risk of bias. We presented dichotomous data with risk ratios (RR) and continuous data with mean difference (MD) or standardized mean difference (SMD). Where appropriate, we combined trials with meta\u2010analysis and used a random\u2010effects model if there was significant heterogeneity (I\u00b2 \u2265 50%). We assessed the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach. \nMain results\nSeven RCTs with a total of 1140 participants met the inclusion criteria. The trials were carried out on children aged three months to five years, in outpatient and inpatient facilities from France, Spain, Peru, India, Kenya, and Ecuador. The efficacy and safety of racecadotril were compared to placebo or no treatment. Racecadotril may reduce the risk of rehydration failure (RR 0.41, 95% CI 0.13 to 1.23; 2 RCTs, 192 participants; low\u2010certainty evidence). Data on duration of diarrhoea, number of stools in the first 48 hours are insufficient to reach a conclusion; stool output in the first 48 hours appears to be lower in the two trials measuring this, although the data is not combinable. Length of hospital stay was similar in two studies measuring this, and overall there was no evidence that racecadotril increased overall rate of adverse events (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.66 to 1.22; 5 RCTs, 688 participants; low\u2010certainty evidence). Most adverse events in the racecadotril group were mild or moderate. \nAuthors' conclusions\nRacecadotril seems to be a safe drug but has little benefit in improving acute diarrhoea in children under five years of age. Current evidence does not support routine use of racecadotril in management of acute diarrhoea in children under five outside of the context of placebo controlled RCTs. \n", "10.1002-14651858.CD007492.pub2-abstract.txt": "Background\nWhen compared to the general population, persons with an intellectual disability have lower life expectancy, higher morbidity, and more difficulty finding and obtaining healthcare. Organisational interventions are used to reconfigure the structure or delivery of healthcare services. This is the first update of the original review. \nObjectives\nTo assess the effects of organisational interventions of healthcare services for the mental and physical health problems of persons with an intellectual disability. \nSearch methods\nFor this update we searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL and other databases, from April 2006 to 4 September 2015. We checked reference lists of included studies and consulted experts in the field. \nSelection criteria\nRandomised controlled trials of organisational interventions of healthcare services aimed at improving care of mental and physical health problems of adult persons with an intellectual disability. \nData collection and analysis\nWe employed standard methodological procedures as outlined in the Cochrane Handbook of Systematic Reviews of Interventions, in addition to specific guidance from the Cochrane Effective Practice and Organisation of Care (EPOC) Group. \nMain results\nWe identified one new trial from the updated searches.\nSeven trials (347 participants) met the selection criteria. The interventions varied but had common components: interventions that increased the intensity and frequency of service delivery (4 trials, 200 participants), community\u2010based specialist behaviour therapy (1 trial, 63 participants), and outreach treatment (1 trial, 50 participants). Another trial compared two active arms (traditional counselling and integrated intervention for bereavement, 34 participants). \nThe included studies investigated interventions dealing with the mental health problems of persons with an intellectual disability; none focused on physical health problems. Four studies assessed the effect of organisational interventions on behavioural problems for persons with an intellectual disability, three assessed care giver burden, and three assessed the costs associated with the interventions. None of the included studies reported data on the effect of organisational interventions on adverse events. Most studies were assessed as having low risk of bias. \nIt is uncertain whether interventions that increase the frequency and intensity of delivery or outreach treatment decrease behavioural problems for persons with an intellectual disability (two and one trials respectively, very low certainty evidence). Behavioural problems were slightly decreased by community\u2010based specialist behavioural therapy (one trial, low certainty evidence). Increasing the frequency and intensity of service delivery probably makes little or no difference to care giver burden (MD 0.03, 95% CI \u20103.48 to 3.54, two trials, moderate certainty evidence). It is uncertain whether outreach treatment makes any difference for care giver burden (one trial, very low certainty evidence).

There are currently no well\u2010designed studies focusing on organising the health services of persons with an intellectual disability and concurrent physical problems. There are very few studies of organisational interventions targeting mental health needs and the results of those that were found need corroboration.

We placed no restrictions on the language or date of publication when searching the electronic databases \nSelection criteria\nRandomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing any treatment against placebo in people with BMS. The primary outcomes were symptom relief (pain/burning) and change in QoL. Secondary outcomes included change in taste, feeling of dryness, and adverse effects. \nData collection and analysis\nWe used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Outcome data were analysed as short\u2010term (up to three months) or long\u2010term (three to six months). \nMain results\nWe included 23 RCTs (1121 analysed participants; 83% female). Interventions were categorised as: antidepressants and antipsychotics, anticonvulsants, benzodiazepines, cholinergics, dietary supplements, electromagnetic radiation, physical barriers, psychological therapies, and topical treatments. \nOnly one RCT was assessed at low risk of bias overall, four RCTs' risk of bias was unclear, and 18 studies were at high risk of bias. Overall quality of the evidence for effectiveness was very low for all interventions and all outcomes. \nTwenty\u2010one RCTs assessed short\u2010term symptom relief. There is very low\u2010quality evidence of benefit from electromagnetic radiation (one RCT, 58 participants), topical benzodiazepines (two RCTs, 111 participants), physical barriers (one RCT, 50 participants), and anticonvulsants (one RCT, 100 participants). We found insufficient/contradictory evidence regarding the effectiveness of antidepressants, cholinergics, systemic benzodiazepines, dietary supplements or topical treatments. No RCT assessing psychological therapies evaluated short\u2010term symptom relief. \nFour studies assessed long\u2010term symptom relief. There is very low\u2010quality evidence of a benefit from psychological therapies (one RCT, 30 participants), capsaicin oral rinse (topical treatment) (one RCT, 18 participants), and topical benzodiazepines (one RCT, 66 participants). We found no evidence of a difference for dietary supplements or lactoperoxidase oral rinse. No studies assessing antidepressants, anticonvulsants, cholinergics, electromagnetic radiation or physical barriers evaluated long\u2010term symptom relief. \nShort\u2010term change in QoL was assessed by seven studies (none long\u2010term).The quality of evidence was very low. A benefit was found for electromagnetic radiation (one RCT, 58 participants), however findings were inconclusive for antidepressants, benzodiazepines, dietary supplements and physical barriers. \nSecondary outcomes (change in taste and feeling of dryness) were only assessed short\u2010term, and the findings for both were also inconclusive. \nWith regard to adverse effects, there is very low\u2010quality evidence that antidepressants increase dizziness and drowsiness (one RCT, 37 participants), and that alpha lipoic acid increased headache (two RCTs, 118 participants) and gastrointestinal complaints (3 RCTs, 138 participants). We found insufficient/contradictory evidence regarding adverse events for anticonvulsants or benzodiazepines. Adverse events were poorly reported or unreported for cholinergics, electromagnetic radiation, and psychological therapies. No adverse events occurred from physical barriers or topical therapy use. \nAuthors' conclusions\nGiven BMS' potentially disabling nature, the need to identify effective modes of treatment for sufferers is vital. Due to the limited number of clinical trials at low risk of bias, there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of any interventions in managing BMS. Further clinical trials, with improved methodology and standardised outcome sets are required in order to establish which treatments are effective. Future studies are encouraged to assess the role of treatments used in other neuropathic pain conditions and psychological therapies in the treatment of BMS. \n", "10.1002-14651858.CD009487.pub3-abstract.txt": "Background\nA parastomal hernia is defined as an incisional hernia related to a stoma, and belongs to the most common stoma\u2010related complications. Many factors, which are considered to influence the incidence of parastomal herniation, have been investigated.

We applied no language restrictions. \nSelection criteria\nRandomized and non\u2010randomized studies comparing lateral pararectal versus transrectal stoma placement with regard to parastomal herniation and other stoma\u2010related complications. \nData collection and analysis\nTwo authors independently assessed study quality and extracted data. We conducted data analyses according to the recommendations of Cochrane and the Cochrane Colorectal Cancer Group (CCCG). We rated quality of evidence according to the GRADE approach. \nMain results\nRandomized controlled trials (RCT) \nOnly one RCT met the inclusion criteria. The participants underwent enterostomy placement in the frame of an operation for: rectal cancer (37/60), ulcerative colitis (14/60), familial adenomatous polyposis (7/60), and other (2/60). \nThe results between the lateral pararectal and the transrectal approach groups were inconclusive for the incidence of parastomal herniation (risk ratio (RR) 1.34, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.40 to 4.48; low\u2010quality evidence); development of ileus or stenosis (RR 2.0, 95% CI 0.19 to 20.9; low\u2010quality evidence); or skin irritation (RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.21 to 2.13; moderate\u2010quality evidence). The results were also inconclusive for the subgroup analysis in which we compared the effect of ileostomy versus colostomy on parastomal herniation. The study did not measured other stoma\u2010related morbidities, or stoma\u2010related mortality, but did measure quality of life, which was not one of our outcomes of interest. \nNon\u2010randomized studies (NRS) \nTen retrospective cohort studies, with a total of 864 participants, met the inclusion criteria. The indications for enterostomy placement and the baseline characteristics of the participants (age, co\u2010morbidities, disease\u2010severity) varied between studies. All included studies reported results for the primary outcome (parastomal herniation) and one study also reported data on one of the secondary outcomes (stomal prolapse). \nThe effects of different surgical approaches on parastomal herniation (RR 1.22, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.75; 10 studies, 864 participants; very low\u2010quality evidence) and the occurrence of stomal prolapse (RR 1.23, 95% CI 0.39 to 3.85; 1 study, 145 participants; very low\u2010quality evidence) are uncertain. \nNone of the included studies measured other stoma\u2010related morbidity or stoma\u2010related mortality. \nAuthors' conclusions\nThe present systematic review of randomized and non\u2010randomized studies found inconsistent results between the two compared interventions regarding their potential to prevent parastomal herniation. \nIn conclusion, there is still a lack of high\u2010quality evidence to support the ideal surgical technique of stoma formation. The available moderate\u2010, low\u2010, and very low\u2010quality evidence, does not support or refute the superiority of one of the studied stoma formation techniques over the other. \n", "10.1002-14651858.CD005974.pub5-abstract.txt": "Background\nAcute respiratory tract infections (ARTIs) are common and may lead to complications. Most children experience between three and six ARTIs annually. Although these infections are self\u2010limiting, symptoms can be distressing. Many treatments are used to control symptoms and shorten illness duration. Most have minimal benefit and may lead to adverse effects. Oral homeopathic medicinal products could play a role in childhood ARTI management if evidence for effectiveness is established. \nObjectives\nTo assess the effectiveness and safety of oral homeopathic medicinal products compared with placebo or conventional therapy to prevent and treat acute respiratory tract infections in children. \nSearch methods\nWe searched CENTRAL (2017, Issue 11) including the Cochrane Acute Respiratory Infections Specialised Register, MEDLINE (1946 to 27 November 2017), Embase (2010 to 27 November 2017), CINAHL (1981 to 27 November 2017), AMED (1985 to December 2014), CAMbase (searched 29 March 2018), British Homeopathic Library (searched 26 June 2013 \u2010 no longer operating). We also searched the WHO ICTRP and ClinicalTrials.gov trials registers (29 March 2018), checked references, and contacted study authors to identify additional studies. \nSelection criteria\nDouble\u2010blind, randomised controlled trials (RCTs) or double\u2010blind cluster\u2010RCTs comparing oral homeopathy medicinal products with identical placebo or self\u2010selected conventional treatments to prevent or treat ARTIs in children aged 0 to 16 years. \nData collection and analysis\nWe used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane.\nMain results\nWe included eight RCTs of 1562 children receiving oral homeopathic medicinal products or a control treatment (placebo or conventional treatment) for upper respiratory tract infections (URTIs). Four treatment studies examined the effect on URTI recovery, and four studies investigated the effect on preventing URTIs after one to three months of treatment, followed up for the remainder of the year. Two treatment and two prevention studies involved homeopaths individualising treatment. The other studies used predetermined, non\u2010individualised treatments. All studies involved highly diluted homeopathic medicinal products. \nWe found several limitations to the included studies, in particular methodological inconsistencies and high attrition rates, failure to conduct intention\u2010to\u2010treat analysis, selective reporting, and apparent protocol deviations. We assessed three studies as at high risk of bias in at least one domain, and many had additional domains with unclear risk of bias. Three studies received funding from homeopathy manufacturers; one support from a non\u2010government organisation; two government support; one was cosponsored by a university; and one did not report funding support. \nMethodological inconsistencies and significant clinical and statistical heterogeneity precluded robust quantitative meta\u2010analysis. Only four outcomes were common to more than one study and could be combined for analysis. Odds ratios (OR) were generally small with wide confidence intervals (CI), and the contributing studies found conflicting effects, so there was little certainty that the efficacy of the intervention could be ascertained. All studies assessed as at low risk of bias showed no benefit from oral homeopathic medicinal products; trials at uncertain and high risk of bias reported beneficial effects. \nWe found low\u2010quality evidence that non\u2010individualised homeopathic medicinal products confer little preventive effect on ARTIs (OR 1.14, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.57). We found low\u2010quality evidence from two individualised prevention studies that homeopathy has little impact on the need for antibiotic usage (N = 369) (OR 0.79, 95% CI 0.35 to 1.76). We also assessed adverse events, hospitalisation rates and length of stay, days off school (or work for parents), and quality of life, but were not able to pool data from any of these secondary outcomes. \nThere is insufficient evidence from two pooled individualised treatment studies (N = 155) to determine the effect of homeopathy on short\u2010term cure (OR 1.31 favouring placebo, 95% CI 0.09 to 19.54; very low\u2010quality evidence) and long\u2010term cure rates (OR 0.99, 95% CI 0.10 to 9.67; very low\u2010quality evidence). Adverse events were reported inconsistently; however, serious events were not reported. One study found an increase in the occurrence of non\u2010severe adverse events in the treatment group. \nAuthors' conclusions\nPooling of two prevention and two treatment studies did not show any benefit of homeopathic medicinal products compared to placebo on ARTI recurrence or cure rates in children. We found no evidence to support the efficacy of homeopathic medicinal products for ARTIs in children. Adverse events were poorly reported, so conclusions about safety could not be drawn. \n", "10.1002-14651858.CD010789.pub2-abstract.txt": "Background\nRecovery strategies are often used with the intention of preventing or minimising muscle soreness after exercise. Whole\u2010body cryotherapy, which involves a single or repeated exposure(s) to extremely cold dry air (below \u2010100 \u00b0C) in a specialised chamber or cabin for two to four minutes per exposure, is currently being advocated as an effective intervention to reduce muscle soreness after exercise. \nObjectives\nTo assess the effects (benefits and harms) of whole\u2010body cryotherapy (extreme cold air exposure) for preventing and treating muscle soreness after exercise in adults. \nSearch methods\nWe searched the Cochrane Bone, Joint and Muscle Trauma Group Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, the British Nursing Index and the Physiotherapy Evidence Database. We also searched the reference lists of articles, trial registers and conference proceedings, handsearched journals and contacted experts.The searches were run in August 2015. \nSelection criteria\nWe aimed to include randomised and quasi\u2010randomised trials that compared the use of whole\u2010body cryotherapy (WBC) versus a passive or control intervention (rest, no treatment or placebo treatment) or active interventions including cold or contrast water immersion, active recovery and infrared therapy for preventing or treating muscle soreness after exercise in adults. We also aimed to include randomised trials that compared different durations or dosages of WBC. Our prespecified primary outcomes were muscle soreness, subjective recovery (e.g. tiredness, well\u2010being) and adverse effects. \nData collection and analysis\nTwo review authors independently screened search results, selected studies, assessed risk of bias and extracted and cross\u2010checked data. Where appropriate, we pooled results of comparable trials. The random\u2010effects model was used for pooling where there was substantial heterogeneity. We assessed the quality of the evidence using GRADE. \nMain results\nFour laboratory\u2010based randomised controlled trials were included. These reported results for 64 physically active predominantly young adults (mean age 23 years). All but four participants were male. Two trials were parallel group trials (44 participants) and two were cross\u2010over trials (20 participants). The trials were heterogeneous, including the type, temperature, duration and frequency of WBC, and the type of preceding exercise. None of the trials reported active surveillance of predefined adverse events. All four trials had design features that carried a high risk of bias, potentially limiting the reliability of their findings. The evidence for all outcomes was classified as 'very low' quality based on the GRADE criteria. \nTwo comparisons were tested: WBC versus control (rest or no WBC), tested in four studies; and WBC versus far\u2010infrared therapy, also tested in one study. No studies compared WBC with other active interventions, such as cold water immersion, or different types and applications of WBC. \nAll four trials compared WBC with rest or no WBC. There was very low quality evidence for lower self\u2010reported muscle soreness (pain at rest) scores after WBC at 1 hour (standardised mean difference (SMD) \u20100.77, 95% confidence interval (CI) \u20101.42 to \u20100.12; 20 participants, 2 cross\u2010over trials); 24 hours (SMD \u20100.57, 95% CI \u20101.48 to 0.33) and 48 hours (SMD \u20100.58, 95% CI \u20101.37 to 0.21), both with 38 participants, 2 cross\u2010over studies, 1 parallel group study; and 72 hours (SMD \u20100.65, 95% CI \u20102.54 to 1.24; 29 participants, 1 cross\u2010over study, 1 parallel group study). Of note is that the 95% CIs also included either no between\u2010group differences or a benefit in favour of the control group. One small cross\u2010over trial (9 participants) found no difference in tiredness but better well\u2010being after WBC at 24 hours post exercise. There was no report of adverse events. \nOne small cross\u2010over trial involving nine well\u2010trained runners provided very low quality evidence of lower levels of muscle soreness after WBC, when compared with infrared therapy, at 1 hour follow\u2010up, but not at 24 or 48 hours. The same trial found no difference in well\u2010being but less tiredness after WBC at 24 hours post exercise. There was no report of adverse events. \nAuthors' conclusions\nThere is insufficient evidence to determine whether whole\u2010body cryotherapy (WBC) reduces self\u2010reported muscle soreness, or improves subjective recovery, after exercise compared with passive rest or no WBC in physically active young adult males. There is no evidence on the use of this intervention in females or elite athletes. The lack of evidence on adverse events is important given that the exposure to extreme temperature presents a potential hazard. Further high\u2010quality, well\u2010reported research in this area is required and must provide detailed reporting of adverse events. \n", "10.1002-14651858.CD005457.pub4-abstract.txt": "Background\nPostpartum haemorrhage (PPH) is one of the major contributors to maternal mortality and morbidity worldwide. Active management of the third stage of labour has been proven to be effective in the prevention of PPH. Syntometrine is more effective than oxytocin but is associated with more side effects. Carbetocin, a long\u2010acting oxytocin agonist, appears to be a promising agent for the prevention of PPH. \nObjectives\nTo determine if the use of oxytocin agonist is as effective as conventional uterotonic agents for the prevention of PPH, and assess the best routes of administration and optimal doses of oxytocin agonist. \nSearch methods\nWe searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (1 March 2011), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2011, Issue 1 of 4), MEDLINE (1966 to 1 March 2011) and EMBASE (1974 to 1 March 2011). We checked references of articles and communicated with authors and pharmaceutical industry contacts. \nSelection criteria\nRandomised controlled trials which compared oxytocin agonist (carbetocin) with other uterotonic agents or with placebo or no treatment for the prevention of PPH. \nData collection and analysis\nTwo review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion, assessed risk of bias and extracted data. \nMain results\nWe included 11 studies (2635 women) in the review. Six trials compared carbetocin with oxytocin; four of these were conducted for women undergoing caesarean deliveries, one was for women following vaginal deliveries and one did not state the mode of delivery clearly. The carbetocin was administered as 100 \u00b5g intravenous dosage across the trials, while oxytocin was administered intravenously but at varied dosages. Four trials compared intramuscular carbetocin and intramuscular syntometrine for women undergoing vaginal deliveries. Three of the trials were on women with no risk factor for PPH, while one trial was on women with risk factors for PPH. One trial compared the use of intravenous carbetocin with placebo. Use of carbetocin resulted in a statistically significant reduction in the need for therapeutic uterotonics (risk ratio (RR) 0.62; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.44 to 0.88; four trials, 1173 women) compared to oxytocin for those who underwent caesarean section, but not for vaginal delivery. Compared to oxytocin, carbetocin was associated with a reduced need for uterine massage following both caesarean delivery (RR 0.54; 95% CI 0.37 to 0.79; two trials, 739 women) and vaginal delivery (RR 0.70; 95% CI 0.51 to 0.94; one trial, 160 women). There were no statistically significant differences between carbetocin and oxytocin in terms of risk of any PPH (blood loss greater than 500 ml) or in risk of severe PPH (blood loss greater than 1000 ml). Comparison between carbetocin and syntometrine showed a lower mean blood loss in women who received carbetocin compared to syntometrine (mean difference (MD) \u201048.84 ml; 95% CI \u201094.82 to \u20102.85; four trials, 1030 women). There was no statistically significant difference in terms of the need for therapeutic uterotonic agents, but the risk of adverse effects such as nausea and vomiting were significantly lower in the carbetocin group: nausea (RR 0.24; 95% CI 0.15 to 0.40; four trials, 1030 women); vomiting (RR 0.21; 95% CI 0.11 to 0.39; four trials, 1030 women). The incidence of postpartum hypertension was also significantly lower in women who received carbetocin compared to those who received syntometrine. Cost\u2010effectiveness of carbetocin was investigated by one study published as an abstract, with limited data. \nAuthors' conclusions\nFor women who undergo caesarean section, carbetocin resulted in a statistically significant reduction in the need for therapeutic uterotonics compared to oxytocin,\u00a0but there is no difference in the incidence of postpartum haemorrhage. Carbetocin is associated with less blood loss compared to syntometrine in the prevention of PPH for women who have vaginal deliveries and is associated with significantly fewer adverse effects. Further research is needed to analyse the cost\u2010effectiveness of carbetocin as a uterotonic agent. \n", "10.1002-14651858.CD009868.pub3-abstract.txt": "Background\nAtherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) is the leading cause of death and disability worldwide, yet ASCVD risk factor control and secondary prevention rates remain low. A fixed\u2010dose combination of blood pressure\u2010 and cholesterol\u2010lowering and antiplatelet treatments into a single pill, or polypill, has been proposed as one strategy to reduce the global burden of ASCVD. \nObjectives\nTo determine the effect of fixed\u2010dose combination therapy on all\u2010cause mortality, fatal and non\u2010fatal ASCVD events, and adverse events. We also sought to determine the effect of fixed\u2010dose combination therapy on blood pressure, lipids, adherence, discontinuation rates, health\u2010related quality of life, and costs. \nSearch methods\nWe updated our previous searches in September 2016 of CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, ISI Web of Science, and DARE, HTA, and HEED. We also searched two clinical trials registers in September 2016. We used no language restrictions. \nSelection criteria\nWe included randomised controlled trials of a fixed\u2010dose combination therapy including at least one blood pressure\u2010lowering and one lipid\u2010lowering component versus usual care, placebo, or an active drug comparator for any treatment duration in adults 18 years old or older, with no restrictions on presence or absence of pre\u2010existing ASCVD. \nData collection and analysis\nThree review authors independently selected studies for inclusion and extracted the data for this update. We evaluated risk of bias using the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' assessment tool. We calculated risk ratios (RR) for dichotomous data and mean differences (MD) for continuous data with 95% confidence intervals (CI) using fixed\u2010effect models when heterogeneity was low (I2 < 50%) and random\u2010effects models when heterogeneity was high (I2 \u2265 50%). We used the GRADE approach to evaluate the quality of evidence. \nMain results\nIn the initial review, we identified nine randomised controlled trials with a total of 7047 participants and four additional trials (n = 2012 participants; mean age range 62 to 63 years; 30% to 37% women) were included in this update. Eight of the 13 trials evaluated the effects of fixed\u2010dose combination (FDC) therapy in populations without prevalent ASCVD, and the median follow\u2010up ranged from six weeks to 23 months. More recent trials were generally larger with longer follow\u2010up and lower risk of bias. The main risk of bias was related to lack of blinding of participants and personnel, which was inherent to the intervention. Compared with the comparator groups (placebo, usual care, or active drug comparator), the effects of the fixed\u2010dose combination treatment on mortality (FDC = 1.0% versus control = 1.0%, RR 1.10, 95% CI 0.64 to 1.89, \u00a0I2 = 0%, 5 studies, N = 5300) and fatal and non\u2010fatal ASCVD events (FDC = 4.7% versus control = 3.7%, RR 1.26, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.66, I2 = 0%, 6 studies, N = 4517) were uncertain (low\u2010quality evidence). The low event rates for these outcomes and indirectness of evidence for comparing fixed\u2010dose combination to usual care versus individual drugs suggest that these results should be viewed with caution. Adverse events were common in both the intervention (32%) and comparator (27%) groups, with participants randomised to fixed\u2010dose combination therapy being 16% (RR 1.16, 95% CI 1.09 to 1.25, 11 studies, 6906 participants, moderate\u2010quality evidence) more likely to report an adverse event . The mean differences in systolic blood pressure between the intervention and control arms was \u20106.34 mmHg (95% CI \u20109.03 to \u20103.64, 13 trials, 7638 participants, moderate\u2010quality evidence). The mean differences (95% CI) in total and LDL cholesterol between the intervention and control arms were \u20100.61 mmol/L (95% CI \u20100.88 to \u20100.35, 11 trials, 6565 participants, low\u2010quality evidence) and \u20100.70 mmol/L (95% CI \u20100.98 to \u20100.41, 12 trials, 7153 participants, moderate\u2010quality evidence), respectively. There was a high degree of statistical heterogeneity in comparisons of blood pressure and lipids (I2 \u2265 80% for all) that could not be explained, so these results should be viewed with caution. Fixed\u2010dose combination therapy improved adherence to a multidrug strategy by 44% (26% to 65%) compared with usual care (4 trials, 3835 participants, moderate\u2010quality evidence). \nAuthors' conclusions\nThe effects of fixed\u2010dose combination therapy on all\u2010cause mortality or ASCVD events are uncertain. A limited number of trials reported these outcomes, and the included trials were primarily designed to observe changes in ASCVD risk factor levels rather than clinical events, which may partially explain the observed differences in risk factors that were not translated into differences in clinical outcomes among the included trials. Fixed\u2010dose combination therapy is associated with modest increases in adverse events compared with placebo, active comparator, or usual care but may be associated with improved adherence to a multidrug regimen. Ongoing, longer\u2010term trials of fixed\u2010dose combination therapy will help demonstrate whether short\u2010term changes in risk factors might be maintained and lead to expected differences in clinical events based on these changes. \n", "10.1002-14651858.CD011106.pub2-abstract.txt": "Background\nMechanical ventilation is a life\u2010saving intervention for critically ill newborn infants with respiratory failure admitted to a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). Ventilating newborn infants can be challenging due to small tidal volumes, high breathing frequencies, and the use of uncuffed endotracheal tubes. Mechanical ventilation has several short\u2010term, as well as long\u2010term complications. To prevent complications, weaning from the ventilator is started as soon as possible. Weaning aims to support the transfer from full mechanical ventilation support to spontaneous breathing activity. \nObjectives\nTo assess the efficacy of protocolized versus non\u2010protocolized ventilator weaning for newborn infants in reducing the duration of invasive mechanical ventilation, the duration of weaning, and shortening the NICU and hospital length of stay. To determine efficacy in predefined subgroups including: gestational age and birth weight; type of protocol; and type of protocol delivery.

Two randomized controlled trials met the inclusion criteria on type of study and type of intervention, but only included a proportion of newborns. The study authors could not provide data needed for subgroup analysis; we excluded both studies. \nAuthors' conclusions\nBased on the results of this review, there is no evidence to support or refute the superiority or inferiority of weaning by protocol over non\u2010protocol weaning on duration of invasive mechanical ventilation in newborn infants. \n", "10.1002-14651858.CD012488.pub2-abstract.txt": "Background\nLong\u2010term physical conditions affect 10% to 12% of children and adolescents worldwide. These individuals are at greater risk of developing psychological problems, particularly anxiety and depression, sometimes directly related to their illness or medical care (e.g. health\u2010related anxiety). There is limited evidence regarding the effectiveness of psychological therapies for treating anxiety and depression in this population. Therapies designed for children and adolescents without medical issues may or may not be appropriate for use with those who have long\u2010term physical conditions. \nObjectives\nThis review was undertaken to assess the effectiveness and acceptability of psychological therapies in comparison with controls (treatment\u2010as\u2010usual, waiting list, attention placebo, psychological placebo, or non\u2010psychological treatment) for treating anxiety and depression in children and adolescents with long\u2010term physical conditions. \nSearch methods\nWe searched Ovid MEDLINE (1950\u2010 ), Embase (1974\u2010 ), PsycINFO (1967\u2010 ) and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) to 27 September 2018. An earlier search of these databases was conducted via the Cochrane Common Mental Disorders Controlled Trial Register (CCMD\u2010CTR) (all years to May 2016). In addition, we searched the Web of Science (Core Collection) (12 October 2018) and conducted a cited reference search for reports of all included trials. We handsearched relevant conference proceedings, reference lists of included articles, and grey literature. \nSelection criteria\nRandomised controlled trials (RCTs), cluster\u2010randomised trials and cross\u2010over trials of psychological therapies for treating anxiety or depression in children with long\u2010term physical conditions were included. \nData collection and analysis\nAbstracts and complete articles were independently reviewed by two authors. Discrepancies were addressed by a third author. Odds ratio (OR) was used for comparing dichotomous data and standardised mean differences (SMD) for comparing continuous data. Meta\u2010analysis was undertaken when treatments, participants, and the underlying clinical question were similar. Otherwise, narrative analysis of data was undertaken. \nMain results\nTwenty\u2010eight RCTs and one cross\u2010over trial with 1349 participants were included in the review. Most participants were recruited from community settings and hospital clinics in high\u2010income countries. For the primary outcome of treatment efficacy, short\u2010term depression (versus any control), there was low\u2010quality evidence from 16 trials involving 1121 participants suggesting that psychological therapies may be more effective than control therapies (SMD \u20100.31, 95% CI \u20100.59 to \u20100.03; I2 = 79%). For the primary outcome of treatment efficacy, short\u2010term anxiety (versus any control), there was inadequate evidence of moderate\u2010quality from 13 studies involving 578 participants to determine whether psychological therapies were more effective than control conditions (SMD \u20100.26, CI \u20100.59 to 0.07, I2 = 72%). Planned sensitivity analyses could not be undertaken for risk of bias due to the small number of trials that rated high for each domain. Additional sensitivity analysis demonstrated that psychological interventions specifically designed to reduce anxiety or depression were more effective than psychological therapies designed to improve other symptoms or general coping. There was some suggestion from subgroup analyses that they type of intervention (Chi\u00b2 = 14.75, df = 5 (P = 0.01), I\u00b2 = 66.1%), the severity of depression (Chi\u00b2 = 23.29, df = 4 (P = 0.0001), I\u00b2 = 82.8%) and the type of long\u2010term physical condition (Chi\u00b2 = 10.55, df = 4 (P = 0.03), I\u00b2 = 62.1%) may have an impact on the overall treatment effect.There was qualitative (reported), but not quantitative evidence confirming the acceptability of selected psychological therapies for anxiety and depression. There was low\u2010quality evidence that psychological therapies were more effective than control conditions in improving quality of life (SMD 1.13, CI 0.44 to 1.82, I2 = 89%) and symptoms of long\u2010term physical conditions (SMD \u20100.34, CI \u20100.6 to \u20100.06, I2 = 70%), but only in the short term. There was inadequate low\u2010quality evidence to determine whether psychological therapies were more effective than control conditions at improving functioning in either the short term or long term. No trials of therapies for addressing health\u2010related anxiety were identified and only two trials reported adverse effects; these were unrelated to psychological therapies. Overall, the evidence was of low to moderate quality, results were heterogeneous, and only one trial had an available protocol. \nAuthors' conclusions\nA limited number of trials of variable quality have been undertaken to assess whether psychological therapies are effective for treating anxiety and depression in children and adolescents with long\u2010term physical conditions. According to the available evidence, therapies specifically designed to treat anxiety or depression (especially those based on principles of cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT)) may be more likely to work in children and adolescents who have mild to moderate levels of symptoms of these disorders, at least in the short term.

One effect of the burn is damage to the limbal epithelial stem cells of the ocular surface with delayed re\u2010epithelialisation, stem cell failure, and conjunctivalisation of the cornea. Amniotic membrane transplantation (AMT) performed in the acute phase (day 0 to day 7) following an ocular surface burn is claimed to reduce pain and accelerate healing. The surgery involves securing a layer of amniotic membrane (AM) to the eyelid margins as a patch to cover the entire ocular surface. However, there is debate about the severity of an ocular burn that may benefit from AMT and uncertainty of whether AMT improves outcomes. \nObjectives\nTo compare the effect of AMT with medical therapy in the first seven days after an ocular surface burn, compared to medical therapy alone. \nSearch methods\nWe searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Trials Register; 2021, Issue 9); Ovid MEDLINE; Ovid Embase; LILACS; the ISRCTN registry; ClinicalTrials.gov and the WHO ICTRP. We did not use any date or language restrictions in the electronic searches for trials. We last searched the electronic databases on 29 September 2021. \nSelection criteria\nWe included randomised trials that compared an AMT applied in the first seven days following an ocular surface burn in addition to medical therapy with medical therapy alone. The outcome measures were failure of re\u2010epithelialisation by day 21 post injury, visual acuity at final follow\u2010up, corneal neovascularisation, symblepharon, time to re\u2010epithelialisation and adverse effects. \nData collection and analysis\nTwo review authors independently screened search results, assessed the included studies for risk of bias and extracted relevant data. We contacted trial investigators for missing information. We summarised data using risk ratios (RRs) and mean differences (MDs) as appropriate. \nMain results\nWe analysed two RCTs, but excluded individual patients who had been treated outside the acute phase in one of the studies (data provided by study authors). In total, 36 moderate burns from one RCT and 92 severe burns from two RCTs were evaluated separately. For both categories, the certainty of the evidence was downgraded principally as a result of high risks of performance and detection biases, and because of imprecision indicated by very wide confidence intervals. In addition, follow\u2010up was insufficiently frequent to calculate time\u2010to\u2010epithelialisation precisely. \nModerate severity ocular burns (Roper\u2010Hall classification II\u2010III) \nThe relative risk of AMT on failure of epithelialisation by day 21 was 0.18 (0.02 to 1.31), and LogMAR visual acuity was 0.32 lower (0.55 to 0.09 lower) in the treatment group (i.e. better), suggesting a possible benefit of AMT. The GRADE assessment for failure of epithelialisation by day 21 was downgraded to very low due to the risk of bias and imprecision (very wide confidence intervals including no effect). The GRADE assessment for visual acuity at final follow\u2010up was downgraded to low due to the risk of bias and imprecision (optimal information size not met). The relative effects of AMT on corneal neovascularisation (RR 0.56; 0.21 to 1.48), symblepharon (RR 0.41; 0.02 to 9.48) and time\u2010to\u2010epithelialisation (13 days lower; 26.30 lower to 0.30 higher) suggest possible benefit of AMT, but the wide confidence intervals indicate that both harm and benefit are possible. GRADE assessments for these outcomes were once again downgraded to very low due to the risk of bias and imprecision. Since adverse effects are rare, the small sample would have fewer occurrences of rare but potentially important adverse effects. The GRADE assessment for adverse effects was therefore considered to be low.\u00a0 \nSevere ocular burns (Roper\u2010Hall classification IV) \nThe relative risk of AMT on failure of epithelialisation by day 21 was 1.03 (0.94 to 1.12), and LogMAR visual acuity was 0.01 higher (0.29 lower to 0.31 higher) in the treatment group (i.e, worse), indicating no benefit of AMT. GRADE assessments for failure of epithelialisation by day 21 and final outcomes were downgraded to low. The relative effects of AMT on corneal neovascularisation (RR 0.84; 0.66 to 1.06), symblepharon (RR 0.89; 0.56 to 1.42) and time\u2010to\u2010epithelialisation (1.66 days lower; 11.09 lower to 7.77 higher) may include both benefit and harm. GRADE assessments for corneal neovascularisation, symblepharon and time\u2010to\u2010epithelialisation were downgraded to low due to risk of bias and imprecision. For adverse effects, the GRADE assessment was downgraded to low, reflecting the small sample sizes in the RCTs. \nAuthors' conclusions\nThere is uncertain evidence to support the treatment of moderate acute ocular surface burns with AMT in addition to standard medical therapy as a means of preventing failure of epithelialisation by day 21, improving visual outcome and reducing corneal neovascularisation, symblepharon formation and time\u2010to\u2010epithelialisation.

There is significant uncertainty about the diagnostic accuracy of non\u2010invasive tests for diagnosis of H pylori. \nObjectives\nTo compare the diagnostic accuracy of urea breath test, serology, and stool antigen test, used alone or in combination, for diagnosis of H pylori infection in symptomatic and asymptomatic people, so that eradication therapy for H pylori can be started. \nSearch methods\nWe searched MEDLINE, Embase, the Science Citation Index and the National Institute for Health Research Health Technology Assessment Database on 4 March 2016. We screened references in the included studies to identify additional studies. We also conducted citation searches of relevant studies, most recently on 4 December 2016. We did not restrict studies by language or publication status, or whether data were collected prospectively or retrospectively. \nSelection criteria\nWe included diagnostic accuracy studies that evaluated at least one of the index tests (urea breath test using isotopes such as 13C or 14C, serology and stool antigen test) against the reference standard (histopathological examination using H & E stain, special stains or immunohistochemical stain) in people suspected of having H pylori infection. \nData collection and analysis\nTwo review authors independently screened the references to identify relevant studies and independently extracted data. We assessed the methodological quality of studies using the QUADAS\u20102 tool. We performed meta\u2010analysis by using the hierarchical summary receiver operating characteristic (HSROC) model to estimate and compare SROC curves. Where appropriate, we used bivariate or univariate logistic regression models to estimate summary sensitivities and specificities. \nMain results\nWe included 101 studies involving 11,003 participants, of which 5839 participants (53.1%) had H pylori infection. The prevalence of H pylori infection in the studies ranged from 15.2% to 94.7%, with a median prevalence of 53.7% (interquartile range 42.0% to 66.5%). Most of the studies (57%) included participants with dyspepsia and 53 studies excluded participants who recently had proton pump inhibitors or antibiotics.There was at least an unclear risk of bias or unclear applicability concern for each study. \nOf the 101 studies, 15 compared the accuracy of two index tests and two studies compared the accuracy of three index tests. Thirty\u2010four studies (4242 participants) evaluated serology; 29 studies (2988 participants) evaluated stool antigen test; 34 studies (3139 participants) evaluated urea breath test\u201013C; 21 studies (1810 participants) evaluated urea breath test\u201014C; and two studies (127 participants) evaluated urea breath test but did not report the isotope used. The thresholds used to define test positivity and the staining techniques used for histopathological examination (reference standard) varied between studies. Due to sparse data for each threshold reported, it was not possible to identify the best threshold for each test. \nUsing data from 99 studies in an indirect test comparison, there was statistical evidence of a difference in diagnostic accuracy between urea breath test\u201013C, urea breath test\u201014C, serology and stool antigen test (P = 0.024). The diagnostic odds ratios for urea breath test\u201013C, urea breath test\u201014C, serology, and stool antigen test were 153 (95% confidence interval (CI) 73.7 to 316), 105 (95% CI 74.0 to 150), 47.4 (95% CI 25.5 to 88.1) and 45.1 (95% CI 24.2 to 84.1). The sensitivity (95% CI) estimated at a fixed specificity of 0.90 (median from studies across the four tests), was 0.94 (95% CI 0.89 to 0.97) for urea breath test\u201013C, 0.92 (95% CI 0.89 to 0.94) for urea breath test\u201014C, 0.84 (95% CI 0.74 to 0.91) for serology, and 0.83 (95% CI 0.73 to 0.90) for stool antigen test. This implies that on average, given a specificity of 0.90 and prevalence of 53.7% (median specificity and prevalence in the studies), out of 1000 people tested for H pylori infection, there will be 46 false positives (people without H pylori infection who will be diagnosed as having H pylori infection). In this hypothetical cohort, urea breath test\u201013C, urea breath test\u201014C, serology, and stool antigen test will give 30 (95% CI 15 to 58), 42 (95% CI 30 to 58), 86 (95% CI 50 to 140), and 89 (95% CI 52 to 146) false negatives respectively (people with H pylori infection for whom the diagnosis of H pylori will be missed). \nDirect comparisons were based on few head\u2010to\u2010head studies. The ratios of diagnostic odds ratios (DORs) were 0.68 (95% CI 0.12 to 3.70; P = 0.56) for urea breath test\u201013C versus serology (seven studies), and 0.88 (95% CI 0.14 to 5.56; P = 0.84) for urea breath test\u201013C versus stool antigen test (seven studies). The 95% CIs of these estimates overlap with those of the ratios of DORs from the indirect comparison. Data were limited or unavailable for meta\u2010analysis of other direct comparisons. \nAuthors' conclusions\nIn people without a history of gastrectomy and those who have not recently had antibiotics or proton ,pump inhibitors, urea breath tests had high diagnostic accuracy while serology and stool antigen tests were less accurate for diagnosis of Helicobacter pylori infection.This is based on an indirect test comparison (with potential for bias due to confounding), as evidence from direct comparisons was limited or unavailable. The thresholds used for these tests were highly variable and we were unable to identify specific thresholds that might be useful in clinical practice. \nWe need further comparative studies of high methodological quality to obtain more reliable evidence of relative accuracy between the tests. Such studies should be conducted prospectively in a representative spectrum of participants and clearly reported to ensure low risk of bias. Most importantly, studies should prespecify and clearly report thresholds used, and should avoid inappropriate exclusions. \n", "10.1002-14651858.CD009030.pub2-abstract.txt": "Background\nImmobilisation and early motion (protected or unrestricted) are both used following hyperextension injuries to the proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joint of the finger. \nObjectives\nTo assess the effects of conservative interventions (non\u2010surgical management) for treating hyperextension injuries of the proximal interphalangeal joints of the fingers. \nSearch methods\nWe searched the Cochrane Bone, Joint and Muscle Trauma Group Specialised Register (January 2012), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (in\u00a0The Cochrane Library\u00a02012, Issue 1), MEDLINE (1946 to January Week 2 2012), EMBASE (1980 to 2012 Week 03), CINAHL (1950 to 24 January 2012), PEDro (1929 to March 2012), trial registers and reference lists of articles. \nSelection criteria\nRandomised and quasi\u2010randomised studies comparing immobilisation/protected mobilisation/unrestricted mobilisation in participants with PIP joint hyperextension injuries managed non\u2010surgically. \nData collection and analysis\nTwo review authors independently assessed risk of bias and extracted data.

We included studies that measured stress or burnout as an outcome, and used workers from any occupation as participants. \nData collection and analysis\nThree authors independently screened and selected 75 unique studies for full\u2010text review from 3431 unique reports identified from the search. We excluded 73 studies based on full\u2010text assessment. We included two studies. Two review authors independently extracted stress outcome data from the two included studies. We contacted study authors to gather additional data. We used standardised mean differences (SMDs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) to report study results. We did not perform meta\u2010analyses due to variability in the primary outcome and considerable statistical heterogeneity. We used the GRADE approach to rate the quality of the evidence. \nMain results\nTwo studies met the inclusion criteria, including a total of 159 participants in the included arms of the studies (67 participants completed computer\u2010based interventions; 92 participants completed in\u2010person interventions). Workers were primarily white, Caucasian, middle\u2010aged, and college\u2010educated. Both studies delivered education about stress, its causes, and strategies to reduce stress (e.g. relaxation or mindfulness) via a computer in the computer\u2010based arm, and via small group sessions in the in\u2010person arm. Both studies measured stress using different scales at short\u2010term follow\u2010up only (less than one month). Due to considerable heterogeneity in the results, we could not pool the data, and we analysed the results of the studies separately. The SMD of stress levels in the computer\u2010based intervention group was 0.81 standard deviations higher (95% CI 0.21 to 1.41) than the in\u2010person group in one study, and 0.35 standard deviations lower (95% CI \u20100.76 to 0.05) than the in\u2010person group in another study.

Antigen\u2010specific active immunotherapy aims to induce tumour antigen\u2010specific anti\u2010tumour immune responses as an alternative treatment for ovarian cancer. \nObjectives\nPrimary objective  \u2022 To assess the clinical efficacy of antigen\u2010specific active immunotherapy for the treatment of ovarian cancer as evaluated by tumour response measured by Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) and/or cancer antigen (CA)\u2010125 levels, response to post\u2010immunotherapy treatment, and survival differences \n\u25e6 In addition, we recorded the numbers of observed antigen\u2010specific humoral and cellular responses Secondary objective  \u2022 To establish which combinations of immunotherapeutic strategies with tumour antigens provide the best immunological and clinical results \nSearch methods\nFor the previous version of this review, we performed a systematic search of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2009, Issue 3), in the Cochrane Library, the Cochrane Gynaecological Cancer Group Specialised Register, MEDLINE and Embase databases, and clinicaltrials.gov (1966 to July 2009). We also conducted handsearches of the proceedings of relevant annual meetings (1996 to July 2009). \nFor the first update of this review, we extended the searches to October 2013, and for this update, we extended the searches to July 2017. \nSelection criteria\nWe searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs), as well as non\u2010randomised studies (NRSs), that included participants with epithelial ovarian cancer, irrespective of disease stage, who were treated with antigen\u2010specific active immunotherapy, irrespective of type of vaccine, antigen used, adjuvant used, route of vaccination, treatment schedule, and reported clinical or immunological outcomes. \nData collection and analysis\nTwo reviews authors independently extracted the data. We evaluated the risk of bias for RCTs according to standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane, and for NRSs by using a selection of quality domains deemed best applicable to the NRS. \nMain results\nWe included 67 studies (representing 3632 women with epithelial ovarian cancer). The most striking observations of this review address the lack of uniformity in conduct and reporting of early\u2010phase immunotherapy studies. Response definitions show substantial variation between trials, which makes comparison of trial results unreliable. Information on adverse events is frequently limited. Furthermore, reports of both RCTs and NRSs frequently lack the relevant information necessary for risk of bias assessment. Therefore, we cannot rule out serious biases in most of the included trials. However, selection, attrition, and selective reporting biases are likely to have affected the studies included in this review. GRADE ratings were high only for survival; for other primary outcomes, GRADE ratings were very low. \nThe largest body of evidence is currently available for CA\u2010125\u2010targeted antibody therapy (17 studies, 2347 participants; very low\u2010certainty evidence). Non\u2010randomised studies of CA\u2010125\u2010targeted antibody therapy suggest improved survival among humoral and/or cellular responders, with only moderate adverse events. However, four large randomised placebo\u2010controlled trials did not show any clinical benefit, despite induction of immune responses in approximately 60% of participants. Time to relapse with CA\u2010125 monoclonal antibody versus placebo, respectively, ranged from 10.3 to 18.9 months versus 10.3 to 13 months (six RCTs, 1882 participants; high\u2010certainty evidence). Only one RCT provided data on overall survival, reporting rates of 80% in both treatment and placebo groups (three RCTs, 1062 participants; high\u2010certainty evidence). Other small studies targeting many different tumour antigens have presented promising immunological results. As these strategies have not yet been tested in RCTs, no reliable inferences about clinical efficacy can be made. Given the promising immunological results and the limited side effects and toxicity reported, exploration of clinical efficacy in large well\u2010designed RCTs may be worthwhile. \nAuthors' conclusions\nWe conclude that despite promising immunological responses, no clinically effective antigen\u2010specific active immunotherapy is yet available for ovarian cancer. Results should be interpreted cautiously, as review authors found a significant dearth of relevant information for assessment of risk of bias in both RCTs and NRSs. \n", "10.1002-14651858.CD012129.pub3-abstract.txt": "Background\nPerineal trauma, due to spontaneous tears, surgical incision (episiotomy), or in association with operative vaginal birth, is common after vaginal birth, and is often associated with postpartum perineal pain. Birth over an intact perineum may also lead to perineal pain. There are adverse health consequences associated with perineal pain for the women and their babies in the short\u2010 and long\u2010term, and the pain may interfere with newborn care and the establishment of breastfeeding. Aspirin has been used in the management of postpartum perineal pain, and its effectiveness and safety should be assessed. This is an update of the review, last published in 2017. \nObjectives\nTo determine the effects of a single dose of aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid), including at different doses, in the relief of acute postpartum perineal pain. \nSearch methods\nFor this update, we searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth's Trials Register (4 October 2019), ClinicalTrials.gov, the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (4 October 2019) and screened reference lists of retrieved studies. \nSelection criteria\nRandomised controlled trials (RCTs), assessing single dose aspirin compared with placebo, no treatment, a different dose of aspirin, or single dose paracetamol or acetaminophen, for women with perineal pain in the early postpartum period. We planned to include cluster\u2010RCTs, but none were identified. We excluded quasi\u2010RCTs and cross\u2010over studies. \nData collection and analysis\nTwo review authors independently assessed study eligibility, extracted data and assessed the risk of bias of the included RCTs. Data were checked for accuracy. The certainty of the evidence for the main comparison (aspirin versus placebo) was assessed using the GRADE approach. \nMain results\nWe included 17 RCTs, 16 of which randomised 1132 women to aspirin or placebo; one RCT did not report numbers of women. Two RCTs (of 16) did not contribute data to meta\u2010analyses. All women had perineal pain post\u2010episiotomy, and were not breastfeeding. Studies were published between 1967 and 1997, and the risk of bias was often unclear, due to poor reporting. \nWe included four comparisons: aspirin versus placebo (15 RCTs); 300 mg versus 600 mg aspirin (1 RCT); 600 mg versus 1200 mg aspirin (2 RCTs); and 300 mg versus 1200 mg aspirin (1 RCT). \nAspirin versus placebo \nAspirin may result in more women reporting adequate pain relief four to eight hours after administration compared with placebo (risk ratio (RR) 2.03, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.69 to 2.42; 13 RCTs, 1001 women; low\u2010certainty evidence). It is uncertain whether aspirin compared with placebo has an effect on the need for additional pain relief (RR 0.25, 95% CI 0.17 to 0.37; 10 RCTs, 744 women; very low\u2010certainty evidence), or maternal adverse effects (RR 1.08, 95% CI 0.57 to 2.06; 14 RCTs, 1067 women; very low\u2010certainty evidence), four to eight hours after administration. Analyses based on dose did not reveal any clear subgroup differences. \n300 mg versus 600 mg aspirin \nIt is uncertain whether over four hours after administration, 300 mg compared with 600 mg aspirin has an effect on adequate pain relief (RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.36 to 1.86; 1 RCT, 81 women) or the need for additional pain relief (RR 0.68, 95% CI 0.12 to 3.88; 1 RCT, 81 women). There were no maternal adverse effects in either aspirin group. \n600 mg versus 1200 mg aspirin \nIt is uncertain whether over four to eight hours after administration, 600 mg compared with 1200 mg aspirin has an effect on adequate pain relief (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.52 to 1.39; 2 RCTs, 121 women), the need for additional pain relief (RR 1.32, 95% CI 0.30 to 5.68; 2 RCTs, 121 women), or maternal adverse effects (RR 3.00, 95% CI 0.13 to 69.52; 2 RCTs, 121 women). \n300 mg versus 1200 mg aspirin \nIt is uncertain whether over four hours after administration, 300 mg compared with 1200 mg aspirin has an effect on adequate pain relief (RR 0.62, 95% CI 0.29 to 1.32; 1 RCT, 80 women) or need for additional pain relief (RR 2.00, 95% CI 0.19 to 21.18; 1 RCT, 80 women). There were no maternal adverse effects in either aspirin group. \nNone of the included RCTs reported on neonatal adverse effects.\nNo RCTs reported on secondary review outcomes of: prolonged hospitalisation due to perineal pain; re\u2010hospitalisation due to perineal pain; fully breastfeeding at discharge; mixed feeding at discharge; fully breastfeeding at six weeks; mixed feeding at six weeks; perineal pain at six weeks; maternal views; or maternal postpartum depression. \nAuthors' conclusions\nSingle dose aspirin may increase adequate pain relief in women with perineal pain post\u2010episiotomy compared with placebo. It is uncertain whether aspirin has an effect on the need for additional analgesia, or on maternal adverse effects, compared with placebo. We downgraded the certainty of the evidence because of study limitations (risk of bias), imprecision, and publication bias. \nAspirin may be considered for use in non\u2010breastfeeding women with post\u2010episiotomy perineal pain. Included RCTs excluded breastfeeding women, so there was no evidence to assess the effects of aspirin on neonatal adverse effects or breastfeeding. \nFuture RCTs should be designed to ensure low risk of bias, and address gaps in the evidence, such as the secondary outcomes established for this review.

The cumulative anticholinergic effect of all the medications a person takes is referred to as the anticholinergic burden because of its potential to cause adverse effects. It is possible that a high anticholinergic burden may be a risk factor for further cognitive decline or neuropsychiatric disturbances in people with dementia. Neuropsychiatric disturbances are the most frequent complication of dementia that require hospitalisation, accounting for almost half of admissions; hence, identification of modifiable prognostic factors for these outcomes is crucial. There are various scales available to measure anticholinergic burden but agreement between them is often poor. \nObjectives\nOur primary objective was to assess whether anticholinergic burden, as defined at the level of each individual scale, was a prognostic factor for further cognitive decline or neuropsychiatric disturbances in older adults with pre\u2010existing diagnoses of dementia or cognitive impairment. Our secondary objective was to investigate whether anticholinergic burden was a prognostic factor for other adverse clinical outcomes, including mortality, impaired physical function, and institutionalisation. \nSearch methods\nWe searched these databases from inception to 29 November 2021: MEDLINE OvidSP, Embase OvidSP, PsycINFO OvidSP, CINAHL EBSCOhost, and ISI Web of Science Core Collection on ISI Web of Science. \nSelection criteria\nWe included prospective and retrospective longitudinal cohort and case\u2010control observational studies, with a minimum of one\u2010month follow\u2010up, which examined the association between an anticholinergic burden measurement scale and the above stated adverse clinical outcomes, in older adults with pre\u2010existing diagnoses of dementia or cognitive impairment. \u00a0 \nData collection and analysis\nTwo review authors independently assessed studies for inclusion, and undertook data extraction, risk of bias assessment, and GRADE assessment. We summarised risk associations between anticholinergic burden and all clinical outcomes in a narrative fashion. We also evaluated the risk association between anticholinergic burden and mortality using a random\u2010effects meta\u2010analysis. \u00a0We established adjusted pooled rates for the anticholinergic cognitive burden (ACB) scale; then, as an exploratory analysis, established pooled rates on the prespecified association across scales.\u00a0 \nMain results\nWe identified 18 studies that met our inclusion criteria (102,684 older adults). Anticholinergic burden was measured using five distinct measurement scales: 12 studies used the ACB scale; 3 studies used the Anticholinergic Risk Scale (ARS); 1 study used the Anticholinergic Drug Scale (ADS); 1 study used the Anticholinergic Effect on Cognition (AEC) Scale; and 2 studies used a list developed by Tune and Egeli.\u00a0 \nRisk associations between anticholinergic burden and adverse clinical outcomes were highly heterogenous. Four out of 10 (40%) studies reported a significantly increased risk of\u00a0greater long\u2010term cognitive decline for participants with an anticholinergic burden compared to participants with no or minimal anticholinergic burden. No studies investigated neuropsychiatric disturbance outcomes. One out of four studies (25%) reported a significant association with reduced physical function for participants with an anticholinergic burden versus participants with no or minimal anticholinergic burden. No study (out of one investigating study) reported a significant association between anticholinergic burden and risk of institutionalisation. Six out of 10 studies (60%) found a significantly increased risk of mortality for those with an anticholinergic burden compared to those with no or minimal anticholinergic burden. Pooled analysis of adjusted mortality hazard ratios (HR) measured anticholinergic burden with the ACB scale, and suggested a significantly increased risk of death for those with a high ACB score relative to those with no or minimal ACB scores (HR 1.153, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.030 to 1.292; 4 studies, 48,663 participants). An exploratory pooled analysis of adjusted mortality HRs across anticholinergic burden scales also suggested a significantly increased risk of death for those with a high anticholinergic burden (HR 1.102, 95% CI 1.044 to 1.163; 6 studies, 68,381 participants). \u00a0 \nOverall GRADE evaluation of results found low\u2010 or very low\u2010certainty evidence for all outcomes.\u00a0 \nAuthors' conclusions\nThere is low\u2010certainty evidence that older adults with dementia or cognitive impairment who have a significant anticholinergic burden may be at increased risk of death.

These studies were conducted in hospital respiratory physiology laboratories. Two studies did not demonstrate any beneficial effect of supplemental oxygen on exercise capacity or exertional dyspnoea. Neither of these studies titrated oxygen requirements to prevent ongoing exertional desaturation. One study showed an increase in exercise capacity as assessed by endurance time with supplemental oxygen. We did not identify any studies that examined the effect of ambulatory oxygen on health\u2010related quality of life, survival, costs or time to exacerbation or hospitalisation. No study reported any adverse events. The quality of evidence for all three studies, as assessed by GRADE criteria, was low. \nAuthors' conclusions\nThis review found no evidence to support or refute the use of ambulatory or short burst oxygen in ILD due to the limited number of included studies and data. Further research is needed to examine the role of this treatment. \n", "10.1002-14651858.CD012216.pub2-abstract.txt": "Background\n18F\u2010florbetapir uptake by brain tissue measured by positron emission tomography (PET) is accepted by regulatory agencies like the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Medicine Agencies (EMA) for assessing amyloid load in people with dementia. Its added value is mainly demonstrated by excluding Alzheimer's pathology in an established dementia diagnosis. However, the National Institute on Aging and Alzheimer's Association (NIA\u2010AA) revised the diagnostic criteria for Alzheimer's disease and confidence in the diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) due to Alzheimer's disease may be increased when using amyloid biomarkers tests like 18F\u2010florbetapir. These tests, added to the MCI core clinical criteria, might increase the diagnostic test accuracy (DTA) of a testing strategy. However, the DTA of 18F\u2010florbetapir to predict the progression from MCI to Alzheimer\u2019s disease dementia (ADD) or other dementias has not yet been systematically evaluated. \nObjectives\nTo determine the DTA of the 18F\u2010florbetapir PET scan for detecting people with MCI at time of performing the test who will clinically progress to ADD, other forms of dementia (non\u2010ADD), or any form of dementia at follow\u2010up. \nSearch methods\nThis review is current to May 2017. We searched MEDLINE (OvidSP), Embase (OvidSP), PsycINFO (OvidSP), BIOSIS Citation Index (Thomson Reuters Web of Science), Web of Science Core Collection, including the Science Citation Index (Thomson Reuters Web of Science) and the Conference Proceedings Citation Index (Thomson Reuters Web of Science), LILACS (BIREME), CINAHL (EBSCOhost), ClinicalTrials.gov (https://clinicaltrials.gov), and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (WHO ICTRP) (http://www.who.int/ictrp/search/en/). We also searched ALOIS, the Cochrane Dementia & Cognitive Improvement Group\u2019s specialised register of dementia studies (http://www.medicine.ox.ac.uk/alois/). We checked the reference lists of any relevant studies and systematic reviews, and performed citation tracking using the Science Citation Index to identify any additional relevant studies. No language or date restrictions were applied to the electronic searches. \nSelection criteria\nWe included studies that had prospectively defined cohorts with any accepted definition of MCI at time of performing the test and the use of 18F\u2010florbetapir scan to evaluate the DTA of the progression from MCI to ADD or other forms of dementia. In addition, we only selected studies that applied a reference standard for Alzheimer\u2019s dementia diagnosis, for example, National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke and the Alzheimer\u2019s Disease and Related Disorders Association (NINCDS\u2010ADRDA) or Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders\u2010IV (DSM\u2010IV) criteria. \nData collection and analysis\nWe screened all titles and abstracts identified in electronic\u2010database searches. Two review authors independently selected studies for inclusion and extracted data to create two\u2010by\u2010two tables, showing the binary test results cross\u2010classified with the binary reference standard. We used these data to calculate sensitivities, specificities, and their 95% confidence intervals. Two independent assessors performed quality assessment using the QUADAS\u20102 tool plus some additional items to assess the methodological quality of the included studies. \nMain results\nWe included three studies, two of which evaluated the progression from MCI to ADD, and one evaluated the progression from MCI to any form of dementia. \nProgression from MCI to ADD was evaluated in 448 participants. The studies reported data on 401 participants with 1.6 years of follow\u2010up and in 47 participants with three years of follow\u2010up. Sixty\u2010one (15.2%) participants converted at 1.6 years follow\u2010up; nine (19.1%) participants converted at three years of follow\u2010up. \nProgression from MCI to any form of dementia was evaluated in five participants with 1.5 years of follow\u2010up, with three (60%) participants converting to any form of dementia. \nThere were concerns regarding applicability in the reference standard in all three studies. Regarding the domain of flow and timing, two studies were considered at high risk of bias. \nMCI to ADD;\nProgression from MCI to ADD in those with a follow\u2010up between two to less than four years had a sensitivity of 67% (95% CI 30 to 93) and a specificity of 71% (95% CI 54 to 85) by visual assessment (n = 47, 1 study). \nProgression from MCI to ADD in those with a follow\u2010up between one to less than two years had a sensitivity of 89% (95% CI 78 to 95) and a specificity of 58% (95% CI 53 to 64) by visual assessment, and a sensitivity of 87% (95% CI 76 to 94) and a specificity of 51% (95% CI 45 to 56) by quantitative assessment by the standardised uptake value ratio (SUVR)(n = 401, 1 study). \nMCI to any form of dementia;\nProgression from MCI to any form of dementia in those with a follow\u2010up between one to less than two years had a sensitivity of 67% (95% CI 9 to 99) and a specificity of 50% (95% CI 1 to 99) by visual assessment (n = 5, 1 study). \nMCI to any other forms of dementia (non\u2010ADD);\nThere was no information regarding the progression from MCI to any other form of dementia (non\u2010ADD). \nAuthors' conclusions\nAlthough sensitivity was good in one included study, considering the poor specificity and the limited data available in the literature, we cannot recommend routine use of 18F\u2010florbetapir PET in clinical practice to predict the progression from MCI to ADD. \nBecause of the poor sensitivity and specificity, limited number of included participants, and the limited data available in the literature, we cannot recommend its routine use in clinical practice to predict the progression from MCI to any form of dementia. \nBecause of the high financial costs of 18F\u2010florbetapir, clearly demonstrating the DTA and standardising the process of this modality are important prior to its wider use. \n", "10.1002-14651858.CD012584.pub2-abstract.txt": "Background\nAntiplatelet agents are recommended for people with myocardial infarction and acute coronary syndromes, transient ischaemic attack or stroke, and for those in whom coronary stents have been inserted. People who take antiplatelet agents are at increased risk of adverse events when undergoing non\u2010cardiac surgery because of these indications. However, taking antiplatelet therapy also introduces risk to the person undergoing surgery because the likelihood of bleeding is increased. Discontinuing antiplatelet therapy before surgery might reduce this risk but subsequently it might make thrombotic problems, such as myocardial infarction, more likely. \nObjectives\nTo compare the effects of continuation versus discontinuation for at least five days of antiplatelet therapy on the occurrence of bleeding and ischaemic events in adults undergoing non\u2010cardiac surgery under general, spinal or regional anaesthesia. \nSearch methods\nWe searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2018, Issue 1), MEDLINE (1946 to January 2018), and Embase (1974 to January 2018). We searched clinical trials registers for ongoing studies, and conducted backward and forward citation searching of relevant articles. \nSelection criteria\nWe included randomized controlled trials of adults who were taking single or dual antiplatelet therapy, for at least two weeks, and were scheduled for elective non\u2010cardiac surgery. Included participants had at least one cardiac risk factor. We planned to include quasi\u2010randomized studies. \nWe excluded people scheduled for minor surgeries under local anaesthetic or sedation in which bleeding that required transfusion or additional surgery was unlikely. We included studies which compared perioperative continuation of antiplatelet therapy versus discontinuation of antiplatelet therapy or versus substitution of antiplatelet therapy with a placebo for at least five days before surgery. \nData collection and analysis\nTwo review authors independently assessed studies for inclusion, extracted data, assessed risk of bias and synthesized findings. Our primary outcomes were: all\u2010cause mortality at longest follow\u2010up (up to six months); all\u2010cause mortality (up to 30 days). Secondary outcomes included: blood loss requiring transfusion of blood products; blood loss requiring further surgical intervention; risk of ischaemic events. We used GRADE to assess the quality of evidence for each outcome \nMain results\nWe included five RCTs with 666 randomized adults. We identified three ongoing studies.\nAll study participants were scheduled for elective general surgery (including abdominal, urological, orthopaedic and gynaecological surgery) under general, spinal or regional anaesthesia. Studies compared continuation of single or dual antiplatelet therapy (aspirin or clopidogrel) with discontinuation of therapy for at least five days before surgery. \nThree studies reported adequate methods of randomization, and two reported methods to conceal allocation. Three studies were placebo\u2010controlled trials and were at low risk of performance bias, and three studies reported adequate methods to blind outcome assessors to group allocation. Attrition was limited in four studies and two studies had reported prospective registration with clinical trial registers and were at low risk of selective outcome reporting bias. \nWe reported mortality at two time points: the longest follow\u2010up reported by study authors up to six months, and time point reported by study authors up to 30 days. Five studies reported mortality up to six months (of which four studies had a longest follow\u2010up at 30 days, and one study at 90 days) and we found that either continuation or discontinuation of antiplatelet therapy may make little or no difference to mortality up to six months (risk ratio (RR) 1.21, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.34 to 4.27; 659 participants; low\u2010certainty evidence); the absolute effect is three more deaths per 1000 with continuation of antiplatelets (ranging from eight fewer to 40 more). Combining the four studies with a longest follow\u2010up at 30 days alone showed the same effect estimate, and we found that either continuation or discontinuation of antiplatelet therapy may make little or no difference to mortality at 30 days after surgery (RR 1.21, 95% CI 0.34 to 4.27; 616 participants; low\u2010certainty evidence); the absolute effect is three more deaths per 1000 with continuation of antiplatelets (ranging from nine fewer to 42 more). \nWe found that either continuation or discontinuation of antiplatelet therapy probably makes little or no difference in incidences of blood loss requiring transfusion (RR 1.37, 95% CI 0.83 to 2.26; 368 participants; absolute effect of 42 more participants per 1000 requiring transfusion in the continuation group, ranging from 19 fewer to 119 more; four studies; moderate\u2010certainty evidence); and may make little or no difference in incidences of blood loss requiring additional surgery (RR 1.54, 95% CI 0.31 to 7.58; 368 participants; absolute effect of six more participants per 1000 requiring additional surgery in the continuation group, ranging from seven fewer to 71 more; four studies; low\u2010certainty evidence). We found that either continuation or discontinuation of antiplatelet therapy may make little or no difference to incidences of ischaemic events (to include peripheral ischaemia, cerebral infarction, and myocardial infarction) within 30 days of surgery (RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.25 to 1.77; 616 participants; absolute effect of 17 fewer participants per 1000 with an ischaemic event in the continuation group, ranging from 39 fewer to 40 more; four studies; low\u2010certainty evidence). \nWe used the GRADE approach to downgrade evidence for all outcomes owing to limited evidence from few studies. We noted a wide confidence in effect estimates for mortality at the end of follow\u2010up and at 30 days, and for blood loss requiring transfusion which suggested imprecision. We noted visual differences in study results for ischaemic events which suggested inconsistency. \nAuthors' conclusions\nWe found low\u2010certainty evidence that either continuation or discontinuation of antiplatelet therapy before non\u2010cardiac surgery may make little or no difference to mortality, bleeding requiring surgical intervention, or ischaemic events. We found moderate\u2010certainty evidence that either continuation or discontinuation of antiplatelet therapy before non\u2010cardiac surgery probably makes little or no difference to bleeding requiring transfusion. Evidence was limited to few studies with few participants, and with few events. The three ongoing studies may alter the conclusions of the review once published and assessed. \n", "10.1002-14651858.CD012019-abstract.txt": "Background\nAbout 10% of reproductive\u2010aged women suffer from endometriosis which is a costly chronic disease that causes pelvic pain and subfertility. Laparoscopy is the 'gold standard' diagnostic test for endometriosis, but it is expensive and carries surgical risks. Currently, there are no simple non\u2010invasive or minimally\u2010invasive tests available in clinical practice that accurately diagnoses endometriosis. \nObjectives\n1. To provide summary estimates of the diagnostic accuracy of urinary biomarkers for the diagnosis of pelvic endometriosis compared to surgical diagnosis as a reference standard. \n2. To assess the diagnostic utility of biomarkers that could differentiate ovarian endometrioma from other ovarian masses. \nUrinary biomarkers were evaluated as replacement tests for surgical diagnosis and as triage tests to inform decisions to undertake surgery for endometriosis. \nSearch methods\nThe searches were not restricted to particular study design, language or publication dates. We searched the following databases to 20 April \u2010 31 July 2015: CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, Web of Science, LILACS, OAIster, TRIP and ClinicalTrials.gov (trial register). MEDION, DARE, and PubMed were also searched to identify reviews and guidelines as reference sources of potentially relevant studies. Recently published papers not yet indexed in the major databases were also sought. The search strategy incorporated words in the title, abstract, text words across the record and the medical subject headings (MeSH) and was modified for each database. \nSelection criteria\nPublished peer\u2010reviewed, randomised controlled or cross\u2010sectional studies of any size were considered, which included prospectively collected samples from any population of reproductive\u2010aged women suspected of having one or more of the following target conditions: ovarian, peritoneal or deep infiltrating endometriosis (DIE). We included studies comparing the diagnostic test accuracy of one or more urinary biomarkers with surgical visualisation of endometriotic lesions. \nData collection and analysis\nTwo authors independently collected and performed a quality assessment of the data from each study. For each diagnostic test, the data were classified as positive or negative for the surgical detection of endometriosis and sensitivity and specificity estimates were calculated. If two or more tests were evaluated in the same cohort, each was considered as a separate data set. The bivariate model was used to obtain pooled estimates of sensitivity and specificity whenever sufficient data sets were available. The predetermined criteria for a clinically useful urine test to replace diagnostic surgery was one with a sensitivity of 94% and a specificity of 79% to detect endometriosis. The criteria for triage tests were set at sensitivity of equal or greater than 95% and specificity of equal or greater than 50%, which in case of negative result rules out the diagnosis (SnOUT test) or sensitivity of equal or greater than 50% with specificity of equal or greater than 95%, which in case of positive result rules the diagnosis in (SpIN test). \nMain results\nWe included eight studies involving 646 participants, most of which were of poor methodological quality. The urinary biomarkers were evaluated either in a specific phase of menstrual cycle or irrespective of the cycle phase. Five studies evaluated the diagnostic performance of four urinary biomarkers for endometriosis, including three biomarkers distinguishing women with and without endometriosis (enolase 1 (NNE); vitamin D binding protein (VDBP); and urinary peptide profiling); and one biomarker (cytokeratin 19 (CK 19)) showing no significant difference between the two groups. All of these biomarkers were assessed in small individual studies and could not be statistically evaluated in a meaningful way. None of the biomarkers met the criteria for a replacement test or a triage test. Three studies evaluated three biomarkers that did not differentiate women with endometriosis from disease\u2010free controls. \nAuthors' conclusions\nThere was insufficient evidence to recommend any urinary biomarker for use as a replacement or triage test in clinical practice for the diagnosis of endometriosis. Several urinary biomarkers may have diagnostic potential, but require further evaluation before being introduced into routine clinical practice. Laparoscopy remains the gold standard for the diagnosis of endometriosis, and diagnosis of endometriosis using urinary biomarkers should only be undertaken in a research setting. \n", "10.1002-14651858.CD013336-abstract.txt": "Background\nIn the treatment of urothelial carcinoma of the bladder, we are currently uncertain of the benefits and harms of standard pelvic lymph node dissection (PLND) compared to extended PLND. \nObjectives\nTo assess the effects of extended versus standard PLND in patients undergoing cystectomy to treat muscle\u2010invasive (cT2 and cT3) and treatment\u2010refractory, non\u2010muscle\u2010invasive (cT1 with or without carcinoma in situ) urothelial carcinoma of the bladder. \nSearch methods\nWe performed a comprehensive literature search using multiple databases (PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Controlled Trials, Web of Science, and LILACS), trial registries, and conference proceedings published up to April 29, 2019, with no restrictions on the language or status of publication. \nSelection criteria\nWe included randomized controlled trials in which participants underwent radical cystectomy (RC) for muscle\u2010invasive or therapy\u2010refractory non\u2010muscle\u2010invasive urothelial carcinoma of the bladder with either an extended PLND with a superior extent reaching as far cranially as the inferior mesenteric vein, or a standard PLND with a superior extent of the bifurcation of the internal and external iliac artery, with otherwise the same anatomical boundaries. \nData collection and analysis\nTwo review authors independently assessed the included studies and extracted data from them for the primary outcomes: time to death from any cause, time to death from bladder cancer and Clavien\u2010Dindo classification of surgical complications grade III\u2010V, and the secondary outcomes: time to recurrence, Clavien\u2010Dindo I\u2010II complications and disease\u2010specific quality of life. \nWe performed statistical analyses using a random\u2010effects model and rated the certainty of evidence according to the GRADE approach. \nMain results\nThe search identified one multicenter trial based in Germany that enrolled 401 participants with histologically confirmed T1 grade 3 or muscle\u2010invasive urothelial carcinoma. The median age was 67 years (range: 59 to 74) and the majority of participants were male (78.3%). No participant received neoadjuvant chemotherapy; a small subset received adjuvant chemotherapy (14.5%). \nPrimary outcomes  \nOur results indicate that extended PLND may reduce the risk of death from any cause over time as compared to standard PLND, but the confidence interval includes the possibility of no effect (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.78, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.57 to 1.07, 401 participants, low\u2010certainty evidence). After five years of follow\u2010up, this may result in 83 fewer deaths (95% CI: 174 fewer to 24 more overall deaths) per 1000 participants: 420 deaths for extended PLND compared to 503 deaths per 1000 for standard PLND. We downgraded the certainty of evidence by two levels due to study limitations and imprecision. \nOur results indicate that extended PLND may reduce the risk of death from bladder cancer over time as compared to standard PLND but, again, the confidence interval includes the possibility of no effect (HR: 0.70, 95% CI: 0.45 to 1.07, participants = 401, low\u2010certainty evidence). After five years of follow\u2010up, this corresponds to 91 fewer deaths per 1000 participants (95% CI: 176 fewer to 19 more bladder cancer deaths): 264 deaths for extended PLND compared to 355 deaths per 1000 for standard PLND. We downgraded the certainty of evidence by two levels due to study limitations and imprecision. \nBased on follow\u2010up of up to 30 days, we are uncertain whether extended PLND leads to more grade III\u2010V complications as compared to standard PLND, because of study limitations and imprecision (risk ratio [RR]: 1.13, 95% CI: 0.84 to 1.52, participants = 401, very low\u2010certainty evidence). \nSecondary outcomes  \nWe are uncertain whether extended PLND reduces the risk of recurrence over time as compared to standard PLND, because of study limitations and imprecision (HR: 0.84, 95% CI: 0.58 to 1.22, participants = 401, very low\u2010certainty evidence). \nBased on follow\u2010up of up to 30 days, we are uncertain whether extended PLND leads to similar grade I\u2010II complications as compared to standard PLND because of study limitations and imprecision (RR: 0.94, 95% CI: 0.74 to 1.19, participants = 401, very low\u2010certainty evidence). \nWe found no trials that reported on disease\u2010specific quality of life.\nAuthors' conclusions\nResults from a single trial indicate that extended PLND in patients undergoing radical cystectomy for invasive urothelial carcinoma of the bladder may reduce death from any cause and death from bladder cancer over time; however, the results include the possibility of no effect. We are uncertain whether the risk of serious complications up to 30 days may be increased. We are also uncertain as to whether the risk of recurrence over time or the risk of minor complications up to 30 days changes. We were unable to conduct any of the preplanned subgroup analyses, in particular, analyses based on extended lymph node dissection templates, clinical tumor stage, and use of neoadjuvant chemotherapy that may be important effect modifiers. Important additional data is expected from a larger, ongoing trial that will also consider the role of neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Inclusion of this trial in the meta\u2010analysis may help address the issue of imprecision which was a common reason for downgrading the certainty of the evidence. \n", "10.1002-14651858.CD013057.pub2-abstract.txt": "Background\nChronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM), sometimes referred to as chronic otitis media (COM), is a chronic inflammation and often polymicrobial infection (involving more than one micro\u2010organism) of the middle ear and mastoid cavity, characterised by ear discharge (otorrhoea) through a perforated tympanic membrane. The predominant symptoms of CSOM are ear discharge and hearing loss. \nAural toileting is a term describing a number of processes for manually cleaning the ear. Techniques used may include dry mopping (with cotton wool or tissue paper), suction clearance (typically under a microscope) or irrigation (using manual or automated syringing). Dry mopping may be effective in removing mucopurulent discharge. Compared to irrigation or microsuction it is less effective in removing epithelial debris or thick pus. Aural toileting can be used alone or in addition to other treatments for CSOM, such as antibiotics or topical antiseptics. \nObjectives\nTo assess the effects of aural toilet procedures for people with CSOM.\nSearch methods\nThe Cochrane ENT Information Specialist searched the Cochrane ENT Register; Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL via the Cochrane Register of Studies); Ovid MEDLINE; Ovid Embase; CINAHL; Web of Science; ClinicalTrials.gov; ICTRP and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. The date of the search was 16 March 2020. \nSelection criteria\nWe included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with at least a one\u2010week follow\u2010up involving people (adults and children) who had chronic ear discharge of unknown cause or CSOM, where the ear discharge had continued for more than two weeks. \nWe included any aural toileting method as the intervention, at any frequency and for any duration. The comparisons were aural toileting compared with a) placebo or no intervention, and b) any other aural toileting method. We analysed trials in which background treatments were used in both arms (e.g. topical antiseptics or topical antibiotics) separately. \nData collection and analysis\nWe used the standard Cochrane methodological procedures. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence for each outcome. \nOur primary outcomes were: resolution of ear discharge or 'dry ear' (whether otoscopically confirmed or not), measured at between one week and up to two weeks, two weeks to up to four weeks, and after four weeks; health\u2010related quality of life using a validated instrument; and ear pain (otalgia) or discomfort or local irritation. Secondary outcomes were hearing, serious complications, and the adverse events of ear bleeding and dizziness/vertigo/balance problems. \nMain results\nWe included three studies with a total of 431 participants (465 ears), reporting on two comparisons. Two studies included only children with CSOM in the community (351 participants) and the other study (80 participants) included children and adults with chronic ear discharge for at least six weeks. None of the included studies reported the outcomes of health\u2010related quality of life, ear pain or the adverse event of ear bleeding. \nDaily aural toileting (dry mopping) versus no treatment \nTwo studies (351 children; 370 ears) compared daily dry mopping with no treatment. Neither study presented results for resolution of ear discharge at between one and up to two weeks or between two to four weeks. For resolution of ear discharge after four weeks, one study reported the results per person. We are very uncertain whether there is a difference at 16 weeks (risk ratio (RR) 1.01, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.60 to 1.72; 1 study; 217 participants) because the certainty of the evidence is very low. \nNo results were reported for the adverse events of dizziness, vertigo or balance problems. Only one study reported serious complications, but it was not clear which group these patients were from, or whether the complications occurred pre\u2010 or post\u2010treatment. One study reported hearing, but the results were presented by treatment outcome rather than by treatment group so it is not possible to determine whether there is a difference between the two groups. \nDaily aural toileting versus single aural toileting on top of topical ciprofloxacin \nOne study (80 participants; 95 ears) compared daily aural toileting (suction) with administration of topical antibiotic (ciprofloxacin) ear drops in a clinic, to a single aural toileting (suction) episode followed by daily self\u2010administered topical antibiotic drops, in participants of all ages. We are unsure whether there is a difference in resolution of ear discharge at between one and up to two weeks (RR 1.09, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.30; 1 study; 80 participants) because the certainty of the evidence is very low. There were no results reported for resolution of ear discharge at between two to four weeks. The results for resolution of ear discharge after four weeks were presented by ear, not person, and could not be adjusted to by person. One patient in the group with single aural toileting and self administration of topical antibiotic ear drops reported the adverse event of dizziness, which the authors attributed to the use of cold topical ciprofloxacin. It is very uncertain whether there is a difference between the groups (RR 0.33, 95% CI 0.01 to 7.95; 1 study; 80 participants, very low\u2010certainty). No results were reported for the other adverse events of vertigo or balance problems, or for serious complications. The authors only reported qualitatively that there was no difference between the two groups in hearing results (very low\u2010certainty). \nAuthors' conclusions\nWe are very uncertain whether or not treatment with aural toileting is effective in resolving ear discharge in people with CSOM, due to a lack of data and the poor quality of the available evidence. We also remain uncertain about other outcomes, including adverse events, as these were not well reported. Similarly, we are very uncertain whether daily suction clearance, followed by antibiotic ear drops administered at a clinic, is better than a single episode of suction clearance followed by self\u2010administration of topical antibiotic ear drops. \n", "10.1002-14651858.CD000371.pub7-abstract.txt": "Background\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) recommends treating all school children at regular intervals with deworming drugs in areas where helminth infection is common. Global advocacy organizations claim routine deworming has substantive health and societal effects beyond the removal of worms. In this update of the 2015 edition we included six new trials, additional data from included trials, and addressed comments and criticisms. \nObjectives\nTo summarize the effects of public health programmes to regularly treat all children with deworming drugs on child growth, haemoglobin, cognition, school attendance, school performance, physical fitness, and mortality. \nSearch methods\nWe searched the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group Specialized Register; Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); MEDLINE; Embase; LILACS; the metaRegister of Controlled Trials (mRCT); reference lists; and registers of ongoing and completed trials up to 19 September 2018. \nSelection criteria\nWe included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi\u2010RCTs that compared deworming drugs for soil\u2010transmitted helminths (STHs) with placebo or no treatment in children aged 16 years or less, reporting on weight, height, haemoglobin, and formal tests of cognition. We also sought data on other measures of growth, school attendance, school performance, physical fitness, and mortality. \nData collection and analysis\nAt least two review authors independently assessed the trials for inclusion, risk of bias, and extracted data. We analysed continuous data using the mean difference (MD) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Where data were missing, we contacted trial authors. We stratified the analysis based on the background burden of STH infection. We used outcomes at time of longest follow\u2010up. We assessed the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach. \nMain results\nWe identified 51 trials, including 10 cluster\u2010RCTs, that met the inclusion criteria. One trial evaluating mortality included over one million children, and the remaining 50 trials included a total of 84,336 participants. Twenty\u2010four trials were in populations categorized as high burden, including nine trials in children selected because they were helminth\u2010stool positive; 18 with intermediate burden; and nine as low burden. \nFirst or single dose of deworming drugs \nFourteen trials reported on weight after a single dose of deworming drugs (4970 participants, 14 RCTs). The effects were variable. There was little or no effect in studies conducted in low and intermediate worm burden groups. In the high\u2010burden group, there was little or no effect in most studies, except for a large effect detected from one study area in Kenya reported in two trials carried out over 30 years ago. These trials result in qualitative heterogeneity and uncertainty in the meta\u2010analysis across all studies (I2 statistic = 90%), with GRADE assessment assessed as very low\u2010certainty, which means we do not know if a first dose or single dose of deworming impacts on weight. \nFor height, most studies showed little or no effect after a single dose, with one of the two trials in Kenya from 30 years ago showing a large average difference (2621 participants, 10 trials, low\u2010certainty evidence). Single dose probably had no effect on average haemoglobin (MD 0.10 g/dL, 95% CI 0.03 lower to 0.22 higher; 1252 participants, five trials, moderate\u2010certainty evidence), or on average cognition (1596 participants, five trials, low\u2010certainty evidence). The data are insufficient to know if there is an effect on school attendance and performance (304 participants, one trial, low\u2010certainty evidence), or on physical fitness (280 participants, three trials, very low\u2010certainty evidence). No trials reported on mortality. \nMultiple doses of deworming drugs \nThe effect of regularly treating children with deworming drugs given every three to six months on weight was reported in 18 trials, with follow\u2010up times of between six months and three years; there was little or no effect on average weight in all but two trials, irrespective of worm prevalence\u2010intensity. The two trials with large average weight gain included one in the high burden area in Kenya carried out over 30 years ago, and one study from India in a low prevalence area where subsequent studies in the same area did not show an effect. This heterogeneity causes uncertainty in any meta\u2010analysis (I2 = 78%). Post\u2010hoc analysis excluding trials published prior to 2000 gave an estimate of average difference in weight gain of 0.02 kg (95%CI from 0.04 kg loss to 0.08 gain, I2 = 0%). Thus we conclude that we do not know if repeated doses of deworming drugs impact on average weight, with a fewer older studies showing large gains, and studies since 2000 showing little or no average gain. \nRegular treatment probably had little or no effect on the following parameters: average height (MD 0.02 cm higher, 95% CI 0.09 lower to 0.13 cm higher; 13,700 participants, 13 trials, moderate\u2010certainty evidence); average haemoglobin (MD 0.01 g/dL lower; 95% CI 0.05 g/dL lower to 0.07 g/dL higher; 5498 participants, nine trials, moderate\u2010certainty evidence); formal tests of cognition (35,394 participants, 8 trials, moderate\u2010certainty evidence); school performance (34,967 participants, four trials, moderate\u2010certainty evidence). The evidence assessing an effect on school attendance is inconsistent, and at risk of bias (mean attendance 2% higher, 95% CI 5% lower to 8% higher; 20,650 participants, three trials, very low\u2010certainty evidence). No trials reported on physical fitness. No effect was shown on mortality (1,005,135 participants, three trials, low\u2010certainty evidence). \nAuthors' conclusions\nPublic health programmes to regularly treat all children with deworming drugs do not appear to improve height, haemoglobin, cognition, school performance, or mortality. We do not know if there is an effect on school attendance, since the evidence is inconsistent and at risk of bias, and there is insufficient data on physical fitness. Studies conducted in two settings over 20 years ago showed large effects on weight gain, but this is not a finding in more recent, larger studies. We would caution against selecting only the evidence from these older studies as a rationale for contemporary mass treatment programmes as this ignores the recent studies that have not shown benefit. \nThe conclusions of the 2015 edition have not changed in this update.\n", "10.1002-14651858.CD004508.pub4-abstract.txt": "Background\nThis is an updated version of the original Cochrane review published in 2007. Traditionally, after major abdominal gynaecologic surgery postoperative oral intake is withheld until the return of bowel function. There has been concern that early oral intake would result in vomiting and severe paralytic ileus with subsequent aspiration pneumonia, wound dehiscence, and anastomotic leakage. However, evidence\u2010based clinical studies suggest that there may be benefits from early postoperative oral intake. \nObjectives\nTo assess the effects of early versus delayed (traditional) initiation of oral intake of food and fluids after major abdominal gynaecologic surgery. \nSearch methods\nWe searched the Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Group's Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), electronic databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL), and the citation lists of relevant publications. The most recent search was conducted 1 April 2014. We also searched a registry for ongoing trials (www.clinicaltrials.gov) on 13 May 2014. \nSelection criteria\nRandomised controlled trials (RCTs) were eligible that compared the effect of early versus delayed initiation of oral intake of food and fluids after major abdominal gynaecologic surgery. Early feeding was defined as oral intake of fluids or food within 24 hours post\u2010surgery regardless of the return of bowel function. Delayed feeding was defined as oral intake after 24 hours post\u2010surgery and only after signs of postoperative ileus resolution. \nData collection and analysis\nTwo review authors selected studies, assessed study quality and extracted the data. For dichotomous data, we calculated the risk ratio (RR) with a 95% confidence interval (CI). We examined continuous data using the mean difference (MD) and a 95% CI. We tested for heterogeneity between the results of different studies using a forest plot of the meta\u2010analysis, the statistical tests of homogeneity of 2 x 2 tables and the I\u00b2 value. We assessed the quality of the evidence using GRADE methods. \nMain results\nRates of developing postoperative ileus were comparable between study groups (RR 0.47, 95% CI 0.17 to 1.29, P = 0.14, 3 RCTs, 279 women, I\u00b2 = 0%, moderate\u2010quality evidence). When we considered the rates of nausea or vomiting or both, there was no evidence of a difference between the study groups (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.64 to 1.67, P = 0.90, 4 RCTs, 484 women, I\u00b2 = 73%, moderate\u2010quality evidence). There was no evidence of a difference between the study groups in abdominal distension (RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.47, 2 RCTs, 301 women, I\u00b2 = 0%) or a need for postoperative nasogastric tube placement (RR 0.48, 95% CI 0.13 to 1.80, 1 RCT, 195 women). Early feeding was associated with shorter time to the presence of bowel sound (MD \u20100.32 days, 95% CI \u20100.61 to \u20100.03, P = 0.03, 2 RCTs, 338 women, I\u00b2 = 52%, moderate\u2010quality evidence) and faster onset of flatus (MD \u20100.21 days, 95% CI \u20100.40 to \u20100.01, P = 0.04, 3 RCTs, 444 women, I\u00b2 = 23%, moderate\u2010quality evidence). In addition, women in the early feeding group resumed a solid diet sooner (MD \u20101.47 days, 95% CI \u20102.26 to \u20100.68, P = 0.0003, 2 RCTs, 301 women, I\u00b2 = 92%, moderate\u2010quality evidence). There was no evidence of a difference in time to the first passage of stool between the two study groups (MD \u20100.25 days, 95% CI \u20100.58 to 0.09, P = 0.15, 2 RCTs, 249 women, I\u00b2 = 0%, moderate\u2010quality evidence). Hospital stay was shorter in the early feeding group (MD \u20100.92 days, 95% CI \u20101.53 to \u20100.31, P = 0.003, 4 RCTs, 484 women, I\u00b2 = 68%, moderate\u2010quality evidence). Infectious complications were less common in the early feeding group (RR 0.20, 95% CI 0.05 to 0.73, P = 0.02, 2 RCTs, 183 women, I\u00b2 = 0%, high\u2010quality evidence). In one study, the satisfaction score was significantly higher in the early feeding group (MD 11.10, 95% CI 6.68 to 15.52, P < 0.00001, 143 women, moderate\u2010quality evidence). \nAuthors' conclusions\nEarly postoperative feeding after major abdominal gynaecologic surgery for either benign or malignant conditions appeared to be safe without increased gastrointestinal morbidities or other postoperative complications. The benefits of this approach include faster recovery of bowel function, lower rates of infectious complications, shorter hospital stay, and higher satisfaction. \n", "10.1002-14651858.CD007176.pub2-abstract.txt": "Background\nOur systematic review has demonstrated that antioxidant supplements may increase mortality. We have now updated this review. \nObjectives\nTo assess the beneficial and harmful effects of antioxidant supplements for prevention of mortality in adults. \nSearch methods\nWe searched The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, LILACS, the Science Citation Index Expanded, and Conference Proceedings Citation Index\u2010Science to February 2011. We scanned bibliographies of relevant publications and asked pharmaceutical companies for additional trials. \nSelection criteria\nWe included all primary and secondary prevention randomised clinical trials on antioxidant supplements (beta\u2010carotene, vitamin A, vitamin C, vitamin E, and selenium) versus placebo or no intervention. \nData collection and analysis\nThree authors extracted data. Random\u2010effects and fixed\u2010effect model meta\u2010analyses were conducted. Risk of bias was considered in order to minimise the risk of systematic errors. Trial sequential analyses were conducted to minimise the risk of random errors. Random\u2010effects model meta\u2010regression analyses were performed to assess sources of intertrial heterogeneity. \nMain results\nSeventy\u2010eight randomised trials with 296,707 participants were included. Fifty\u2010six trials including 244,056 participants had low risk of bias. Twenty\u2010six trials included 215,900 healthy participants. Fifty\u2010two trials included 80,807 participants with various diseases in a stable phase. The mean age was 63 years (range 18 to 103 years). The mean proportion of women was 46%. Of the 78 trials, 46 used the parallel\u2010group design, 30 the factorial design, and 2 the cross\u2010over design. All antioxidants were administered orally, either alone or in combination with vitamins, minerals, or other interventions. The duration of supplementation varied from 28 days to 12 years (mean duration 3 years; median duration 2 years). Overall, the antioxidant supplements had no significant effect on mortality in a random\u2010effects model meta\u2010analysis (21,484 dead/183,749 (11.7%) versus 11,479 dead/112,958 (10.2%); 78 trials, relative risk (RR) 1.02, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.98 to 1.05) but significantly increased mortality in a fixed\u2010effect model (RR 1.03, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.05). Heterogeneity was low with an I2\u2010 of 12%. In meta\u2010regression analysis, the risk of bias and type of antioxidant supplement were the only significant predictors of intertrial heterogeneity. Meta\u2010regression analysis did not find a significant difference in the estimated intervention effect in the primary prevention and the secondary prevention trials. In the 56 trials with a low risk of bias, the antioxidant supplements significantly increased mortality (18,833 dead/146,320 (12.9%) versus 10,320 dead/97,736 (10.6%); RR 1.04, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.07). This effect was confirmed by trial sequential analysis. Excluding factorial trials with potential confounding showed that 38 trials with low risk of bias demonstrated a significant increase in mortality (2822 dead/26,903 (10.5%) versus 2473 dead/26,052 (9.5%); RR 1.10, 95% CI 1.05 to 1.15). In trials with low risk of bias, beta\u2010carotene (13,202 dead/96,003 (13.8%) versus 8556 dead/77,003 (11.1%); 26 trials, RR 1.05, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.09) and vitamin E (11,689 dead/97,523 (12.0%) versus 7561 dead/73,721 (10.3%); 46 trials, RR 1.03, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.05) significantly increased mortality, whereas vitamin A (3444 dead/24,596 (14.0%) versus 2249 dead/16,548 (13.6%); 12 trials, RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.97 to 1.18), vitamin C (3637 dead/36,659 (9.9%) versus 2717 dead/29,283 (9.3%); 29 trials, RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.07), and selenium (2670 dead/39,779 (6.7%) versus 1468 dead/22,961 (6.4%); 17 trials, RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.03) did not significantly affect mortality. In univariate meta\u2010regression analysis, the dose of vitamin A was significantly associated with increased mortality (RR 1.0006, 95% CI 1.0002 to 1.001, P = 0.002). \nAuthors' conclusions\nWe found no evidence to support antioxidant supplements for primary or secondary prevention. Beta\u2010carotene and vitamin E seem to increase mortality, and so may higher doses of vitamin A. Antioxidant supplements need to be considered as medicinal products and should undergo sufficient evaluation before marketing. \n", "10.1002-14651858.CD009134.pub2-abstract.txt": "Background\nEach year, more than four million abdominal surgeries are performed in the US and over 250,000 in England. Acute respiratory failure, a common complication that can affect 30% to 50% of people after upper abdominal surgery, can lead to significant morbidity and mortality. Noninvasive ventilation has been associated with lower rates of tracheal intubation in adults with acute respiratory failure, thus reducing the incidence of complications and mortality. This review compared the effectiveness and safety of noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NPPV) versus standard oxygen therapy in the treatment of acute respiratory failure after upper abdominal surgery. \nObjectives\nTo assess the effectiveness and safety of noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NPPV), that is, continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) or bilevel NPPV, in reducing mortality and the rate of tracheal intubation in adults with acute respiratory failure after upper abdominal surgery, compared to standard therapy (oxygen therapy), and to assess changes in arterial blood gas levels, hospital and intensive care unit (ICU) length of stay, gastric insufflation, and anastomotic leakage. \nSearch methods\nThe date of the last search was 12 May 2015. We searched the following databases: the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (CENTRAL) (2015, Issue 5), MEDLINE (Ovid SP, 1966 to May 2015), EMBASE (Ovid SP, 1974 to May 2015); the physiotherapy evidence database (PEDro) (1999 to May 2015); the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL, EBSCOhost, 1982 to May 2015), and LILACS (BIREME, 1986 to May 2015). We reviewed reference lists of included studies and contacted experts. We also searched grey literature sources. We checked databases of ongoing trials such as www.controlled\u2010trials.com/ and www.trialscentral.org/. We did not apply language restrictions. \nSelection criteria\nWe selected randomized or quasi\u2010randomized controlled trials involving adults with acute respiratory failure after upper abdominal surgery who were treated with CPAP or bilevel NPPV with, or without, drug therapy as standard medical care, compared to adults treated with oxygen therapy with, or without, standard medical care. \nData collection and analysis\nTwo authors independently selected and abstracted data from eligible studies using a standardized form. We evaluated study quality by assessing allocation concealment; random sequence generation; incomplete outcome data; blinding of participants, personnel, and outcome assessors; selective reporting; and adherence to the intention\u2010to\u2010treat (ITT) principle. \nMain results\nWe included two trials involving 269 participants. The participants were mostly men (67%); the mean age was 65 years. The trials were conducted in China and Italy (one was a multicentre trial). Both trials included adults with acute respiratory failure after upper abdominal surgery. We judged both trials at high risk of bias. Compared to oxygen therapy, CPAP or bilevel NPPV may reduce the rate of tracheal intubation (risk ratio (RR) 0.25; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.08 to 0.83; low quality evidence) with a number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome of 11. There was very low quality evidence that the intervention may also reduce ICU length of stay (mean difference (MD) \u20101.84 days; 95% CI \u20103.53 to \u20100.15). We found no differences for mortality (low quality evidence) and hospital length of stay. There was insufficient evidence to be certain that CPAP or NPPV had an effect on anastomotic leakage, pneumonia\u2010related complications, and sepsis or infections. Findings from one trial of 60 participants suggested that bilevel NPPV, compared to oxygen therapy, may improve blood gas levels and blood pH one hour after the intervention (partial pressure of arterial oxygen (PaO2): MD 22.5 mm Hg; 95% CI 17.19 to 27.81; pH: MD 0.06; 95% CI 0.01 to 0.11; partial pressure of arterial carbon dioxide (PCO2) levels (MD \u20109.8 mm Hg; 95% CI \u201014.07 to \u20105.53). The trials included in this systematic review did not present data on the following outcomes that we intended to assess: gastric insufflation, fistulae, pneumothorax, bleeding, skin breakdown, eye irritation, sinus congestion, oronasal drying, and patient\u2010ventilator asynchrony. \nAuthors' conclusions\nThe findings of this review indicate that CPAP or bilevel NPPV is an effective and safe intervention for the treatment of adults with acute respiratory failure after upper abdominal surgery. However, based on the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology, the quality of the evidence was low or very low. More good quality studies are needed to confirm these findings. \n", "10.1002-14651858.CD010497.pub2-abstract.txt": "Background\nPsoriasis is a chronic inflammatory skin condition that can markedly reduce life quality. Several systemic therapies exist for moderate to severe psoriasis, including oral fumaric acid esters (FAE). These contain dimethyl fumarate (DMF), the main active ingredient, and monoethyl fumarate. FAE are licensed for psoriasis in Germany but used off\u2010licence in many countries. \nObjectives\nTo assess the effects and safety of oral fumaric acid esters for psoriasis.\nSearch methods\nWe searched the following databases up to 7 May 2015: the Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL in the Cochrane Library (Issue 4, 2015), MEDLINE (from 1946), EMBASE (from 1974), and LILACS (from 1982). We searched five trials registers and checked the reference lists of included and excluded studies for further references to relevant randomised controlled trials. We handsearched six conference proceedings that were not already included in the Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register. \nSelection criteria\nRandomised controlled trials (RCTs) of FAE, including DMF monotherapy, in individuals of any age and sex with a clinical diagnosis of psoriasis. \nData collection and analysis\nTwo review authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. Primary outcomes were improvement in Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) score and the proportion of participants discontinuing treatment due to adverse effects. \nMain results\nWe included 6 studies (2 full reports, 2 abstracts, 1 brief communication, and 1 letter), with a total of 544 participants. Risk of bias was unclear in several studies because of insufficient reporting. Five studies compared FAE with placebo, and one study compared FAE with methotrexate. All studies reported data at 12 to 16 weeks, and we identified no longer\u2010term studies. When FAE were compared with placebo, we could not perform meta\u2010analysis for the primary outcome of PASI score because the three studies that assessed this outcome reported the data differently, although all studies reported a significant reduction in PASI scores with FAE. Only 1 small study designed for psoriatic arthritis reported on the other primary outcome of participants discontinuing treatment due to adverse effects (2 of 13 participants on FAE compared with none of the 14 participants on placebo; risk ratio (RR) 5.36, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.28 to 102.1; 27 participants; very low\u2010quality evidence). However, these findings are uncertain due to indirectness and a very wide confidence interval. Two studies, containing 247 participants and both only reported as abstracts, allowed meta\u2010analysis for PASI 50, which showed superiority of FAE over placebo (RR 4.55, 95% CI 2.80 to 7.40; low\u2010quality evidence), with a combined PASI 50 of 64% in those given FAE compared with a PASI 50 of 14% for those on placebo, representing a number needed to treat to benefit of 2. The same studies reported more participants achieving PASI 75 with FAE, but we did not pool the data because of significant heterogeneity; none of the studies measured PASI 90. One study reported significant improvement in participants' quality of life (QoL) with FAE, measured with Skindex\u201029. However, we could not compute the mean difference because of insufficient reporting in the abstract. More participants experienced adverse effects, mainly gastrointestinal disturbance and flushing, on FAE (RR 4.72, 95% CI 2.45 to 9.08; 1 study, 99 participants; moderate\u2010quality evidence), affecting 76% of participants given FAE and 16% of the placebo group (representing a number needed to treat to harm of 2). The other studies reported similar findings or did not report adverse effects fully. \nOne study of 54 participants compared methotrexate (MTX) with FAE. PASI score at follow\u2010up showed superiority of MTX (mean Difference (MD) 3.80, 95% CI 0.68 to 6.92; 51 participants; very low\u2010quality evidence), but the difference was not significant after adjustment for baseline disease severity. The difference between groups for the proportion of participants who discontinued treatment due to adverse effects was uncertain because of imprecision (RR 0.19, 95% CI 0.02 to 1.53; 1 study, 51 participants; very low\u2010quality evidence). Overall, the number of participants experiencing common nuisance adverse effects was not significantly different between the 2 groups, with 89% of the FAE group affected compared with 100% of the MTX group (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.03; 54 participants; very low\u2010quality evidence). Flushing was more frequent in those on FAE, with 13 out of 27 participants affected compared with 2 out of 27 given MTX. There was no significant difference in the number of participants who attained PASI 50, 75, and 90 in the 2 groups (very low\u2010quality evidence) whereas this study did not measure the effect of treatments on QoL. The included studies reported no serious adverse effects of FAE and were too small and of limited duration to provide evidence about rare or delayed effects. \nAuthors' conclusions\nEvidence suggests that FAE are superior to placebo and possibly similar in efficacy to MTX for psoriasis; however, the evidence provided in this review was limited, and it must be noted that four out of six included studies were abstracts or brief reports, restricting study reporting. FAE are associated with nuisance adverse effects, including flushing and gastrointestinal disturbance, but short\u2010term studies reported no serious adverse effects. \n", "10.1002-14651858.CD011749.pub2-abstract.txt": "Background\nAlthough delirium is typically an acute reversible cognitive impairment, its presence is associated with devastating impact on both short\u2010term and long\u2010term outcomes for critically ill patients. Advances in our understanding of the negative impact of delirium on patient outcomes have prompted trials evaluating multiple pharmacological interventions. However, considerable uncertainty surrounds the relative benefits and safety of available pharmacological interventions for this population. \nObjectives\nPrimary objective  \n1. To assess the effects of pharmacological interventions for treatment of delirium on duration of delirium in critically ill adults with confirmed or documented high risk of delirium \nSecondary objectives  \nTo assess the following:\n1. effects of pharmacological interventions on delirium\u2010free and coma\u2010free days; days with coma; delirium relapse; duration of mechanical ventilation; intensive care unit (ICU) and hospital length of stay; mortality; and long\u2010term outcomes (e.g. cognitive; discharge disposition; health\u2010related quality of life); and \n2. the safety of such treatments for critically ill adult patients.\nSearch methods\nWe searched the following databases from their inception date to 21 March 2019: Ovid MEDLINE\u00ae, Ovid MEDLINE\u00ae In\u2010Process & Other Non\u2010Indexed Citations, Embase Classic+Embase, and PsycINFO using the Ovid platform. We also searched the Cochrane Library on Wiley, the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO) (http://www.crd.york.ac.uk/PROSPERO/), the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), and Web of Science. We performed a grey literature search of relevant databases and websites using the resources listed in Grey Matters developed by the Canadian Agency for Drugs and Technologies in Health (CADTH). We also searched trial registries and abstracts from annual scientific critical care and delirium society meetings. \nSelection criteria\nWe sought randomized controlled trials (RCTs), including quasi\u2010RCTs, of any pharmacological (drug) for treatment of delirium in critically ill adults. The drug intervention was to be compared to another active drug treatment, placebo, or a non\u2010pharmacological intervention (e.g. mobilization). We did not apply any restrictions in terms of drug class, dose, route of administration, or duration of delirium or drug exposure. We defined critically ill patients as those treated in an ICU of any specialty (e.g. burn, cardiac, medical, surgical, trauma) or high\u2010dependency unit. \nData collection and analysis\nTwo review authors independently identified studies from the search results; four review authors (in pairs) performed data extraction and assessed risk of bias independently. We performed data synthesis through pairwise meta\u2010analysis and network meta\u2010analysis (NMA). Our hypothetical network structure was designed to be analysed at the drug class level and illustrated a network diagram of 'nodes' (i.e. drug classes) and 'edges' (i.e. comparisons between different drug classes from existing trials), thus describing a treatment network of all possible comparisons between drug classes. We assessed the quality of the body of evidence according to GRADE, as very low, low, moderate, or high. \nMain results\nWe screened 7674 citations, from which 14 trials with 1844 participants met our inclusion criteria. Ten RCTs were placebo\u2010controlled, and four reported comparisons of different drugs. Drugs examined in these trials were the following: antipsychotics (n = 10), alpha2 agonists (n = 3; all dexmedetomidine), statins (n = 2), opioids (n = 1; morphine), serotonin antagonists (n = 1; ondansetron), and cholinesterase (CHE) inhibitors (n = 1; rivastigmine). Only one of these trials consistently used non\u2010pharmacological interventions that are known to improve patient outcomes in both intervention and control groups. \nEleven studies (n = 1153 participants) contributed to analysis of the primary outcome. Results of the NMA showed that the intervention with the smallest ratio of means (RoM) (i.e. most preferred) compared with placebo was the alpha2 agonist dexmedetomidine (0.58; 95% credible interval (CrI) 0.26 to 1.27; surface under the cumulative ranking curve (SUCRA) 0.895; moderate\u2010quality evidence). In order of descending SUCRA values (best to worst), the next best interventions were atypical antipsychotics (RoM 0.80, 95% CrI 0.50 to 1.11; SUCRA 0.738; moderate\u2010quality evidence), opioids (RoM 0.88, 95% CrI 0.37 to 2.01; SUCRA 0.578; very\u2010low quality evidence), and typical antipsychotics (RoM 0.96, 95% CrI 0.64 to1.36; SUCRA 0.468; high\u2010quality evidence). \nThe NMAs of multiple secondary outcomes revealed that only the alpha2 agonist dexmedetomidine was associated with a shorter duration of mechanical ventilation (RoM 0.55, 95% CrI 0.34 to 0.89; moderate\u2010quality evidence), and the CHE inhibitor rivastigmine was associated with a longer ICU stay (RoM 2.19, 95% CrI 1.47 to 3.27; moderate\u2010quality evidence). Adverse events often were not reported in these trials or, when reported, were rare; pair\u2010wise analysis of QTc prolongation in seven studies did not show significant differences between antipsychotics, ondansetron, dexmedetomidine, and placebo. \nAuthors' conclusions\nWe identified trials of varying quality that examined six different drug classes for treatment of delirium in critically ill adults. We found evidence that the alpha2 agonist dexmedetomidine may shorten delirium duration, although this small effect (compared with placebo) was seen in pairwise analyses based on a single study and was not seen in the NMA results. Alpha2 agonists also ranked best for duration of mechanical ventilation and length of ICU stay, whereas the CHE inhibitor rivastigmine was associated with longer ICU stay. We found no evidence of a difference between placebo and any drug in terms of delirium\u2010free and coma\u2010free days, days with coma, physical restraint use, length of stay, long\u2010term cognitive outcomes, or mortality. No studies reported delirium relapse, resolution of symptoms, or quality of life. The ten ongoing studies and the six studies awaiting classification that we identified, once published and assessed, may alter the conclusions of the review. \n", "10.1002-14651858.CD009058.pub3-abstract.txt": "Background\nThe liver is affected by two of the most common groups of malignant tumours: primary liver tumours and liver metastases from colorectal carcinoma. Liver metastases are significantly more common than primary liver cancer and long\u2010term survival rates reported for patients after radical surgical treatment is approximately 50%. However, R0 resection (resection for cure) is not feasible in the majority of patients. Cryotherapy is performed with the use of an image\u2010guided cryoprobe which delivers liquid nitrogen or argon gas to the tumour tissue. The subsequent process of freezing is associated with formation of ice crystals, which directly damage exposed tissue, including cancer cells. \nObjectives\nTo assess the beneficial and harmful effects of cryotherapy compared with no intervention, other ablation methods, or systemic treatments in people with liver metastases. \nSearch methods\nWe searched The Cochrane Hepato\u2010Biliary Group Controlled Trials Register, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE Ovid, Embase Ovid, and six other databases up to June 2018. \nSelection criteria\nRandomised clinical trials assessing beneficial and harmful effects of cryotherapy and its comparators for liver metastases, irrespective of the location of the primary tumour. \nData collection and analysis\nWe used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. We extracted information on participant characteristics, interventions, study outcomes, and data on the outcomes important for our review, as well as information on the design and methodology of the trials. Two review authors independently assessed risk of bias in each study. One review author performed data extraction and a second review author checked entries. \nMain results\nWe found no randomised clinical trials comparing cryotherapy versus no intervention or versus systemic treatments; however, we identified one randomised clinical trial comparing cryotherapy with conventional surgery. The trial was conducted in Ukraine. The trial included 123 participants with solitary, or multiple unilobar or bilobar liver metastases; 63 participants received cryotherapy and 60 received conventional surgery. There were 36 women and 87 men. The primary sites for the metastases were colon and rectum (66.6%), stomach (7.3%), breast (6.5%), skin (4.9%), ovaries (4.1%), uterus (3.3%), kidney (3.3%), intestines (1.6%), pancreas (1.6%), and unknown (0.8%). The trial was not reported sufficiently enough to assess the risk of bias of the randomisation process, allocation concealment, or presence of blinding. It was also not possible to assess incomplete outcome data and selective outcome reporting bias. The certainty of evidence was low because of risk of bias and imprecision. \nThe participants were followed for up to 10 years (minimum five months). The trial reported that the mortality at 10 years was 81% (51/63) in the cryotherapy group and 92% (55/60) in the conventional surgery group. The calculated by us relative risk (RR) with 95% Confidence Interval (CI) was: RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.02. We judged the evidence as low\u2010certainty evidence. Regarding adverse events and complications, separately and in total, our calculation showed no evidence of a difference in recurrence of the malignancy in the liver: 86% (54/63) of the participants in the cryotherapy group and 95% (57/60) of the participants in the conventional surgery group developed a new malignancy (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.01; low\u2010certainty evidence). The frequency of reported complications was similar between the cryotherapy group and the conventional surgery group, except for postoperative pain. Both insignificant and pronounced pain were reported to be more common in the cryotherapy group while intense pain was reported to be more common in the conventional surgery group. However, the authors did not report whether there was any evidence of a difference. There were no intervention\u2010related mortality or bile leakages. \nWe identified no evidence for health\u2010related quality of life, cancer mortality, or time to progression of liver metastases. The study reported tumour response in terms of the carcinoembryonic antigen level in 69% of participants, and reported results in the form of a graph for 30% of participants. The carcinoembryonic antigen level was lower in the cryotherapy group, and decreased to normal values faster in comparison with the control group (P < 0.05). \nFunding: the trial did not provide information on funding.\nAuthors' conclusions\nThe evidence for the effectiveness of cryotherapy versus conventional surgery in people with liver metastases is of low certainty. We are uncertain about our estimate and cannot determine whether cryotherapy compared with conventional surgery is beneficial or harmful. We found no evidence for the benefits or harms of cryotherapy compared with no intervention, or versus systemic treatments. \n", "10.1002-14651858.CD013664.pub2-abstract.txt": "Background\nTrabeculectomy is a surgical treatment for glaucoma to lower intraocular pressure with high success rates; however, it is often associated with an increased rate of cataract formation. Cataract can cause symptoms such as glare in bright conditions, foggy vision, and difficulty in driving at night. Cataract extraction surgery is highly successful in improving vision, but it comes at a cost of trabeculectomy failure, with a reported risk of 30% to 40%. An additional intervention to promote trabeculectomy survival after cataract extraction is needed. This review encompassed all adjunctive therapies used at the time of cataract surgery to increase trabeculectomy survival rate. \nObjectives\nTo investigate the effect of the adjunctive modulation of wound healing during cataract surgery on the survival of a previously functioning trabeculectomy. \nSearch methods\nWe searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Trials Register; 2021, Issue 4); Ovid MEDLINE; Ovid Embase; the ISRCTN registry; ClinicalTrials.gov; and the WHO ICTRP. We did not use any date or language restrictions in the electronic searches for trials. We last searched the electronic databases on 14 April 2021. \nSelection criteria\nWe planned\u00a0to include all randomised controlled trials (RCTs)\u00a0of participants who had a functioning trabeculectomy and were undergoing cataract surgery that compared any adjunctive therapy intended to modulate wound healing (such as 5\u2010fluorouracil, mitomycin C, or anti\u2010vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) therapy) with no adjuvant therapy.\u00a0 \nData collection and analysis\nWe used standard methods expected by Cochrane. Our primary outcome was\u00a0trabeculectomy failure at 6 months and 12 months after cataract surgery. Secondary outcomes were\u00a0mean intraocular pressure difference from pre\u2010cataract surgery baseline to 6 to 18 months post\u2010cataract surgery; number of medications required to control eye pressure compared to before cataract surgery; bleb appearance as measured by a summation score of the Moorfields bleb grading system or other equivalent numerical grading systems; visual field progression measured by difference in mean deviation from baseline; and any complications. \nMain results\nWe did not identify any RCTs of adjunctive modulation of wound healing during cataract surgery to promote survival of a previous trabeculectomy. \nAuthors' conclusions\nThere is a need for an RCT to investigate the role of adjuvant wound modulating therapy at the time of cataract surgery to promote survival of a functioning trabeculectomy. \n", "10.1002-14651858.CD004314.pub3-abstract.txt": "Background\nThis is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 2003. Cervical dystonia is the most common form of focal dystonia and is a disabling disorder characterised by painful involuntary head posturing. There are two available formulations of botulinum toxin, with botulinum toxin type A (BtA) usually considered the first line therapy for this condition. Botulinum toxin type B (BtB) is an alternative option, with no compelling theoretical reason why it might not be as\u2010 or even more effective \u2010 than BtA. \nObjectives\nTo compare the efficacy, safety and tolerability of botulinum toxin type A (BtA) versus botulinum toxin type B (BtB) in people with cervical dystonia. \nSearch methods\nTo identify studies for this review we searched the Cochrane Movement Disorders Group Trials Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, reference lists of articles and conference proceedings. All elements of the search, with no language restrictions, were last run in October 2016. \nSelection criteria\nDouble\u2010blind, parallel, randomised, placebo\u2010controlled trials (RCTs) comparing BtA versus BtB in adults with cervical dystonia. \nData collection and analysis\nTwo independent authors assessed records, selected included studies, extracted data using a paper pro forma, and evaluated the risk of bias. We resolved disagreements by consensus or by consulting a third author. We performed meta\u2010analyses using the random\u2010effects model, for the comparison BtA versus BtB to estimate pooled effects and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). No prespecified subgroup analyses were carried out. The primary efficacy outcome was improvement on any validated symptomatic rating scale, and the primary safety outcome was the proportion of participants with adverse events. \nMain results\nWe included three RCTs, all new to this update, of very low to low methodological quality, with a total of 270 participants. \nTwo studies exclusively enrolled participants with a known positive response to BtA treatment. This raises concerns of population enrichment, with a higher probability of benefit from BtA treatment. None of the trials were free of for\u2010profit bias, nor did they provide information regarding registered study protocols. All trials evaluated the effect of a single Bt treatment session, and not repeated treatment sessions, using doses from 100 U to 250 U of BtA (all onabotulinumtoxinA, or Botox, formulations) and 5000 U to 10,000 U of BtB (rimabotulinumtoxinB, or Myobloc/Neurobloc). \nWe found no difference between the two types of botulinum toxin in terms of overall efficacy, with a mean difference of \u20101.44 (95% CI \u20103.58 to 0.70) points lower on the Toronto Western Spasmodic Torticollis Rating Scale (TWSTRS) for BtB\u2010treated participants, measured at two to four weeks after injection. The proportion of participants with adverse events was also not different between BtA and BtB (BtB versus BtA risk ratio (RR) 1.40; 95% CI 1.00 to 1.96). However, when compared to BtA, treatment with BtB was associated with an increased risk of one adverse events of special interest, namely treatment\u2010related sore throat/dry mouth (BtB versus BtA RR of 4.39; 95% CI 2.43 to 7.91). Treatment\u2010related dysphagia (swallowing difficulties) was not different between BtA and BtB (RR 2.89; 95% CI 0.80 to 10.41). The two types of botulinum toxin were otherwise clinically non\u2010distinguishable in all the remaining outcomes. \nAuthors' conclusions\nThe previous version of this review did not include any trials, since these were still ongoing at the time. Therefore, with this update we are able to change the conclusions of this review. There is low quality evidence that a single treatment session of BtA (specifically onabotulinumtoxinA) and a single treatment session of BtB (rimabotulinumtoxinB) are equally effective and safe in the treatment of adults with certain types of cervical dystonia. Treatment with BtB appears to present an increased risk of sore throat/dry mouth, compared to BtA. Overall, there is no clinical evidence from these single\u2010treatment trials to support or contest the preferential use of one form of botulinum toxin over the other. \n", "10.1002-14651858.CD012665.pub2-abstract.txt": "Background\nAcquired hearing loss is common and its incidence increases markedly with age. In most people, 'age\u2010related' hearing loss is sensorineural (due to the loss of cochlear hair cells) and bilateral, affecting both ears to the same degree. Hearing loss categorised as mild, moderate or severe is primarily managed with hearing aids. People with bilateral hearing loss may be offered one aid, fitted to one specific ear, or two aids fitted to both ears. There is uncertainty about the relative benefits to people with hearing loss of these different strategies. \nObjectives\nTo assess the effects of bilateral versus unilateral hearing aids in adults with a bilateral hearing impairment. \nSearch methods\nThe Cochrane ENT Information Specialist searched the ENT Trials Register; Cochrane Register of Studies Online; PubMed; Ovid Embase; CINAHL; Web of Science; ClinicalTrials.gov; ICTRP and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. The date of the search was 8 June 2017. \nSelection criteria\nRandomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing the fitting of two versus one ear\u2010level acoustic hearing aids in adults (over 18 years) with a bilateral hearing impairment, both ears being eligible for hearing aids. \nData collection and analysis\nWe used the standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Our primary outcomes were patient preference for bilateral or unilateral aids, hearing\u2010specific health\u2010related quality of life and adverse effects (pain or discomfort in the ear, initiation or exacerbation of middle or outer ear infection). Secondary outcomes included: usage of hearing aids (as measured by, for example, data logging or battery consumption), generic health\u2010related quality of life, listening ability and audiometric benefit measured as binaural loudness summation. We used GRADE to assess the quality of the evidence for each outcome; this is indicated in italics. \nMain results\nWe included four cross\u2010over RCTs with a total of 209 participants, ranging in age from 23 to 85 and with a preponderance of men. All the studies allowed the use of hearing aids for a total period of at least eight weeks before questions on preference were asked. All studies recruited patients with bilateral hearing loss but there was considerable variation in the types and degree of sensorineural hearing loss that the participants were experiencing. \nThree of the studies were published before the mid\u20101990s whereas the fourth study was published in 2011. Therefore, only the most recent study used hearing aids incorporating technology comparable to that currently readily available in high\u2010income settings. Of the four studies, two were conducted in the UK in National Health Service (NHS \u2013 public sector) patients: one recruited patients from primary care with hearing loss detected by a screening programme whereas the other recruited patients who had been referred by their primary care practitioner to an otolaryngology department for hearing aids. The other two studies were conducted in the United States: one study recruited only military personnel or veterans with noise\u2010induced hearing loss whereas about half of the participants in the other study were veterans. \nOnly one primary outcome (patient preference) was reported in all studies. The percentage of patients who preferred bilateral hearing aids varied between studies: this was 54% (51 out of 94 participants), 39% (22 out of 56), 55% (16 out of 29) and 77% (23 out of 30), respectively. We have not combined the data from these four studies. The evidence for this outcome is of very low quality. \nThe other outcomes of interest were not reported in the included studies.\nAuthors' conclusions\nThis review identified only four studies comparing the use of one hearing aid with two. The studies were small and included participants of widely varying ages. There was also considerable variation in the types and degree of sensorineural hearing loss that the participants were experiencing. \nFor the most part, the types of hearing aid evaluated would now be regarded, in high\u2010income settings, as 'old technology', with only one study looking at 'modern' digital aids. However, the relevance of this is uncertain, as this review did not evaluate the differences in outcomes between the different types of technology. \nWe were unable to pool data from the four studies and the very low quality of the evidence leads us to conclude that we do not know if people with hearing loss have a preference for one aid or two. Similarly, we do not know if hearing\u2010specific health\u2010related quality of life, or any of our other outcomes, are better with bilateral or unilateral aids. \n", "10.1002-14651858.CD011082.pub2-abstract.txt": "Background\nCentral venous catheters (CVCs) provide secured venous access in neonates. Antimicrobial dressings applied over the CVC sites have been proposed to reduce catheter\u2010related blood stream infection (CRBSI) by decreasing colonisation. However, there may be concerns on the local and systemic adverse effects of these dressings in neonates. \nObjectives\nWe assessed the effectiveness and safety of antimicrobial (antiseptic or antibiotic) dressings in reducing CVC\u2010related infections in newborn infants. Had there been relevant data, we would have evaluated the effects of antimicrobial dressings in different subgroups, including infants who received different types of CVCs, infants who required CVC for different durations, infants with CVCs with and without other antimicrobial modifications, and infants who received an antimicrobial dressing with and without a clearly defined co\u2010intervention. \nSearch methods\nWe used the standard search strategy of the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group (CNRG). We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library 2015, Issue 9), MEDLINE (PubMed), EMBASE (EBCHOST), CINAHL and references cited in our short\u2010listed articles using keywords and MeSH headings, up to September 2015. \nSelection criteria\nWe included randomised controlled trials that compared an antimicrobial CVC dressing against no dressing or another dressing in newborn infants. \nData collection and analysis\nWe extracted data using the standard methods of the CNRG. Two review authors independently assessed the eligibility and risk of bias of the retrieved records. We expressed our results using risk difference (RD) and risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). \nMain results\nOut of 173 articles screened, three studies were included. There were two comparisons: chlorhexidine dressing following alcohol cleansing versus polyurethane dressing following povidone\u2010iodine cleansing (one study); and silver\u2010alginate patch versus control (two studies). A total of 855 infants from level III neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) were evaluated, 705 of whom were from a single study. All studies were at high risk of bias for blinding of care personnel or unclear risk of bias for blinding of outcome assessors. There was moderate\u2010quality evidence for all major outcomes. \nThe single study comparing chlorhexidine dressing/alcohol cleansing against polyurethane dressing/povidone\u2010iodine cleansing showed no significant difference in the risk of CRBSI (RR 1.18, 95% CI 0.53 to 2.65; RD 0.01, 95% CI \u22120.02 to 0.03; 655 infants, moderate\u2010quality evidence) and sepsis without a source (RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.52; RD 0.01, 95% CI \u22120.04 to 0.06; 705 infants, moderate\u2010quality evidence). There was a significant reduction in the risk of catheter colonisation favouring chlorhexidine dressing/alcohol cleansing group (RR 0.62, 95% CI 0.45 to 0.86; RD \u22120.09, 95% CI \u22120.15 to \u22120.03; number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) 11, 95% CI 7 to 33; 655 infants, moderate\u2010quality evidence). However, infants in the chlorhexidine dressing/alcohol cleansing group were significantly more likely to develop contact dermatitis, with 19 infants in the chlorhexidine dressing/alcohol cleansing group having developed contact dermatitis compared to none in the polyurethane dressing/povidone\u2010iodine cleansing group (RR 43.06, 95% CI 2.61 to 710.44; RD 0.06, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.08; number needed to treat for an additional harmful outcome (NNTH) 17, 95% CI 13 to 33; 705 infants, moderate\u2010quality evidence). The roles of chlorhexidine dressing in the outcomes reported were unclear, as the two assigned groups received different co\u2010interventions in the form of different skin cleansing agents prior to catheter insertion and during each dressing change. \nIn the other comparison, silver\u2010alginate patch versus control, the data for CRBSI were analysed separately in two subgroups as the two included studies reported the outcome using different denominators: one using infants and another using catheters. There were no significant differences between infants who received silver\u2010alginate patch against infants who received standard line dressing in CRBSI, whether expressed as the number of infants (RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.14 to 1.78; RD \u22120.12, 95% CI \u22120.33 to 0.09; 1 study, 50 participants, moderate\u2010quality evidence) or as the number of catheters (RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.27 to 1.89; RD \u22120.05, 95% CI \u22120.20 to 0.10; 1 study, 118 participants, moderate\u2010quality evidence). There was also no significant difference between the two groups in mortality (RR 0.55, 95% CI 0.15 to 2.05; RD \u22120.04, 95% CI \u22120.13 to 0.05; two studies, 150 infants, I\u00b2 = 0%, moderate\u2010quality evidence). No adverse skin reaction was recorded in either group. \nAuthors' conclusions\nBased on moderate\u2010quality evidence, chlorhexidine dressing/alcohol skin cleansing reduced catheter colonisation, but made no significant difference in major outcomes like sepsis and CRBSI compared to polyurethane dressing/povidone\u2010iodine cleansing. Chlorhexidine dressing/alcohol cleansing posed a substantial risk of contact dermatitis in preterm infants, although it was unclear whether this was contributed mainly by the dressing material or the cleansing agent. While silver\u2010alginate patch appeared safe, evidence is still insufficient for a recommendation in practice. Future research that evaluates antimicrobial dressing should ensure blinding of caregivers and outcome assessors and ensure that all participants receive the same co\u2010interventions, such as the skin cleansing agent. Major outcomes like sepsis, CRBSI and mortality should be assessed in infants of different gestation and birth weight. \n", "10.1002-14651858.CD004474.pub2-abstract.txt": "Background\nTongxinluo capsule is a medicine consisting of traditional Chinese herbs and insects used for cardiovascular diseases in China and some other Asian countries.

Although it is generally agreed that feeding must be initiated slowly and advanced with much greater deliberation than in a healthy, full\u2010term infant, the way in which feeds are introduced and advanced in preterm infants varies widely. This review focuses on whether dilute or full\u2010strength formula is the preferable mode of introducing feeds in preterm infants for whom expressed breast milk is unavailable. \nObjectives\nTo assess the effects of dilute versus full\u2010strength formula on the incidence of necrotising enterocolitis, feeding intolerance, weight gain, length of stay in hospital and time to achieve full calorie intake in exclusively formula\u2010fed preterm or low birth weight infants. A secondary objective was to assess the effects of different dilution strategies. \nSearch methods\nWe used the standard search strategy of Cochrane Neonatal to update the search in the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL 2018, Issue 9), MEDLINE via PubMed (1966 to 1 October 2018), Embase (1980 to 1 October 2018), and CINAHL (1982 to 1 October 2018). \nWe searched clinical trials' registries for ongoing or recently completed trials (clinicaltrials.gov; the World Health Organization\u2019s International Trials Registry and Platform; and the ISRCTN Registry). \nSelection criteria\nRandomised or quasi\u2010randomised trials comparing strengths of formula milk in exclusively formula\u2010fed preterm or low birth weight infants. We excluded studies if infants received formula as a supplement to breast milk. \nData collection and analysis\nWe independently assessed studies for inclusion. We collected data using the standard methods of Cochrane Neonatal, with independent assessment of risk of bias and data extraction. We synthesised mean differences using a fixed\u2010effect meta\u2010analysis model. We used the GRADE approach to assess the certainty of evidence. \nMain results\nWe included three studies involving 102 preterm or low birth weight infants in the review. The studies compared dilute (double\u2010volume, half\u2010strength) formula with full\u2010strength (20 kcal/oz (~ 68 to 70 kcal/100 mL)) formula. We assessed all three studies as having unclear risk of bias due to the likely absence of blinding of study personnel and the potential for selection bias in the largest trial. Data for the primary outcome of necrotising enterocolitis were not reported in any of the studies. We could combine two of the studies (88 infants) in the meta\u2010analysis. The evidence suggests that dilute formula with double\u2010volume (half\u2010strength) may lead to fewer episodes of gastric residuals per day (one study; mean difference (MD) \u22121.20, 95% confidence interval (CI) \u22122.20 to \u22120.20; low\u2010certainty evidence), fewer episodes of gastric residuals per baby until attaining 100 kcal/kg (one study; MD \u22120.80, 95% CI \u22121.32 to \u22120.28; low\u2010certainty evidence), fewer episodes of vomiting per day (one study; MD \u22120.04, 95% CI \u22120.07 to \u22120.01; low\u2010certainty evidence) and fewer occurrences of abdominal distension greater than 2 cm (two studies; MD \u22120.16, 95% CI \u22120.19 to \u22120.13; low\u2010certainty evidence). For the secondary outcomes, data suggest that infants in the dilute formula with double\u2010volume (half\u2010strength) group may have attained an adequate energy intake earlier than infants in the full\u2010strength group (two studies; MD \u22122.26, 95% CI \u22122.85 to \u22121.67; low\u2010certainty evidence). There was no evidence of a difference between groups for weight gain one week after commencement of intragastric feeds (one study; MD 0.05 kg, 95% CI \u22120.06 to 0.15; low\u2010certainty evidence). Data were not reported for length of hospital stay. \nAuthors' conclusions\nThere is low\u2010certainty evidence from three small, old trials that use of dilute formula in preterm or low birth weight formula\u2010fed infants may lead to an important reduction in the time taken for preterm infants to attain an adequate energy intake. \nHowever, our confidence in this result is limited due to uncertainty over risk of bias and sparsity of available data. Dilute formula may reduce incidence of feeding intolerance, but the clinical significance of the reduction is uncertain.

It is the second update of a review originally published in December 2017 and first updated in August 2019. \nObjectives\nTo assess the effectiveness of school dental screening programmes on overall oral health status and use of dental services. \nSearch methods\nAn information specialist searched four bibliographic databases up to 15 October 2021 and used additional search methods to identify published, unpublished and ongoing studies. \nSelection criteria\nWe included randomised controlled trials (RCTs; cluster\u2010 or individually randomised) that evaluated school dental screening compared with no intervention, or that compared two different types of screening. \nData collection and analysis\nWe used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane.\nMain results\nThe previous version of this review included seven RCTs, and our updated search identified one additional trial. Therefore, this update included eight trials (six cluster\u2010RCTs) with 21,290 children aged 4 to 15 years. Four trials were conducted in the UK, two in India, one in the USA and one in Saudi Arabia. We rated two trials at low risk of bias, three at high risk of bias and three at unclear risk of bias.\u00a0 \nNo trials had long\u2010term follow\u2010up to ascertain the lasting effects of school dental screening. The trials assessed outcomes at 3 to 11 months of follow\u2010up. \nNo trials reported the proportion of children with treated or untreated oral diseases other than caries. Neither did they report on cost\u2010effectiveness or adverse events. \nFour trials evaluated traditional screening versus no screening. We performed a meta\u2010analysis for the outcome 'dental attendance' and found an inconclusive result with high heterogeneity. The heterogeneity was partly due to study design (three cluster\u2010RCTs and one individually randomised trial). Due to this inconsistency, and unclear risk of bias, we downgraded the evidence to very low certainty, and we are unable to draw conclusions about this comparison. \nTwo cluster\u2010RCTs (both four\u2010arm trials) evaluated criteria\u2010based screening versus no screening, suggesting a possible small benefit (pooled risk ratio (RR) 1.07, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.99 to 1.16; low\u2010certainty evidence). There was no evidence of a difference when comparing criteria\u2010based screening to traditional screening (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.08; very low\u2010certainty evidence). \nOne trial compared a specific (personalised) referral letter to a non\u2010specific letter. Results favoured the specific referral letter for increasing attendance at general dentist services (RR 1.39, 95% CI 1.09 to 1.77; very low\u2010certainty evidence) and attendance at specialist orthodontist services (RR 1.90, 95% CI 1.18 to 3.06; very low\u2010certainty evidence). \nOne trial compared screening supplemented with motivation to screening alone. Dental attendance was more likely after screening supplemented with motivation (RR 3.08, 95% CI 2.57 to 3.71; very low\u2010certainty evidence). \nOne trial compared referral to a specific dental treatment facility with advice to attend a dentist. There was no evidence of a difference in dental attendance between these two referrals (RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.34 to 2.47; very low\u2010certainty evidence). \nOnly one trial reported the proportion of children with treated dental caries. This trial evaluated a post\u2010screening referral letter based on the common\u2010sense model of self\u2010regulation (a theoretical framework that explains how people understand and respond to threats to their health), with or without a dental information guide, compared to a standard referral letter. The findings were inconclusive. Due to high risk of bias, indirectness and imprecision, we assessed the evidence as very low certainty. \nAuthors' conclusions\nThe evidence is insufficient to draw conclusions about whether there is a role for school dental screening in improving dental attendance.\u00a0 \nWe are uncertain whether traditional screening is better than no screening (very low\u2010certainty evidence). Criteria\u2010based screening may improve dental attendance when compared to no screening (low\u2010certainty evidence). However, when compared to traditional screening, there is no evidence of a difference in dental attendance (very low\u2010certainty evidence). \nFor children requiring treatment, personalised or specific referral letters may improve dental attendance when compared to non\u2010specific referral letters (very low\u2010certainty evidence). Screening supplemented with motivation (oral health education and offer of free treatment) may improve dental attendance in comparison to screening alone (very low\u2010certainty evidence). We are uncertain whether a referral letter based on the 'common\u2010sense model of self\u2010regulation' is better than a standard referral letter (very low\u2010certainty evidence) or whether specific referral to a dental treatment facility is better than a generic advice letter to visit the dentist (very low\u2010certainty evidence). \nThe trials included in this review evaluated effects of school dental screening in the short term. None of them evaluated its effectiveness for improving oral health or addressed possible adverse effects or costs. \n", "10.1002-14651858.CD011345.pub2-abstract.txt": "Background\nFertility problems are very common, as subfertility affects about 10% to 15% of couples trying to conceive. There are many factors that may impact a couple's ability to conceive and one of these may be incorrect timing of intercourse. Conception is only possible from approximately five days before up to several hours after ovulation. Therefore, to be effective, intercourse must take place during this fertile period. 'Timed intercourse' is the practice of prospectively identifying ovulation and, thus, the fertile period to increase the likelihood of conception. Whilst timed intercourse may increase conception rates and reduce unnecessary intervention and costs, there may be associated adverse aspects including time consumption and stress. Ovulation prediction methods used for timing intercourse include urinary hormone measurement (luteinizing hormone (LH), estrogen), tracking basal body temperatures, cervical mucus investigation, calendar charting and ultrasonography. This review considered the evidence from randomised controlled trials for the use of timed intercourse on positive pregnancy outcomes. \nObjectives\nTo assess the benefits and risks of ovulation prediction methods for timing intercourse on conception in couples trying to conceive. \nSearch methods\nWe searched the following sources to identify relevant randomised controlled trials, the Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Group Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, PubMed, LILACS, Web of Knowledge, the World Health Organization (WHO) Clinical Trials Register Platform and ClinicalTrials.gov. Furthermore, we manually searched the references of relevant articles. The search was not restricted by language or publication status. The last search was on 5 August 2014. \nSelection criteria\nWe included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing timed intercourse versus intercourse without ovulation prediction or comparing different methods of ovulation prediction for timing intercourse against each other in couples trying to conceive. \nData collection and analysis\nTwo review authors independently assessed trial eligibility and risk of bias and extracted the data. The primary review outcomes were cumulative live birth and adverse events (such as quality of life, depression and stress). Secondary outcomes were clinical pregnancy, pregnancy (clinical or self\u2010reported pregnancy, not yet confirmed by ultrasound) and time to conception. We combined data to calculate pooled risk ratios (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Statistical heterogeneity was assessed using the I2 statistic. We assessed the overall quality of the evidence for the main comparisons using GRADE methods. \nMain results\nWe included five RCTs (2840 women or couples) comparing timed intercourse versus intercourse without ovulation prediction. Unfortunately one large study (n = 1453) reporting live birth and pregnancy had not published outcome data by randomised group and therefore could not be analysed. Consequently, four RCTs (n = 1387) were included in the meta\u2010analysis. The evidence was of low to very low quality. Main limitations for downgrading the evidence included imprecision, lack of reporting clinically relevant outcomes and the high risk of publication bias. \nOne study reported live birth, but the sample size was too small to draw any relevant conclusions on the effect of timed intercourse (RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.16 to 3.41, 1 RCT, n = 17, very low quality). One study reported stress as an adverse event. There was no evidence of a difference in levels of stress (mean difference 1.98, 95 CI% \u20100.87 to 4.83, 1 RCT, n = 77, low level evidence). No other studies reported adverse events. Two studies reported clinical pregnancy. There was no evidence of a difference in clinical pregnancy rates (RR 1.10, 95% CI 0.57 to 2.12, 2 RCTs, n = 177, I2 = 0%, low level evidence). This suggested that if the chance of a clinical pregnancy following intercourse without ovulation prediction is assumed to be 16%, the chance of success following timed intercourse would be between 9% and 33%.Four studies reported pregnancy rate (clinical or self\u2010reported pregnancy). Timed intercourse was associated with higher pregnancy rates compared to intercourse without ovulation prediction in couples trying to conceive (RR 1.35, 95% CI 1.06 to 1.71, 4 RCTs, n = 1387, I2 = 0%, very low level evidence). This suggests that if the chance of a pregnancy following intercourse without ovulation prediction is assumed to be 13%, the chance following timed intercourse would be between 14% and 23%. Subgroup analysis by duration of subfertility showed no difference in effect between couples trying to conceive for < 12 months versus couples trying for \u2265 12 months. One trial reported time to conception data and showed no evidence of a difference in time to conception. \nAuthors' conclusions\nThere are insufficient data available to draw conclusions on the effectiveness of timed intercourse for the outcomes of live birth, adverse events and clinical pregnancy. Timed intercourse may improve pregnancy rates (clinical or self\u2010reported pregnancy, not yet confirmed by ultrasound) compared to intercourse without ovulation prediction. The quality of this evidence is low to very low and therefore findings should be regarded with caution. There is a high risk of publication bias, as one large study remains unpublished 8 years after recruitment finished. Further research is required, reporting clinically relevant outcomes (live birth, clinical pregnancy rates and adverse effects), to determine if timed intercourse is safe and effective in couples trying to conceive. \n", "10.1002-14651858.CD012204.pub2-abstract.txt": "Background\nThe projected rise in the incidence of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) could develop into a substantial health problem worldwide. Whether dipeptidyl\u2010peptidase (DPP)\u20104 inhibitors or glucagon\u2010like peptide (GLP)\u20101 analogues are able to prevent or delay T2DM and its associated complications in people at risk for the development of T2DM is unknown. \nObjectives\nTo assess the effects of DPP\u20104 inhibitors and GLP\u20101 analogues on the prevention or delay of T2DM and its associated complications in people with impaired glucose tolerance, impaired fasting blood glucose, moderately elevated glycosylated haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) or any combination of these. \nSearch methods\nWe searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials; MEDLINE; PubMed; Embase; ClinicalTrials.gov; the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform; and the reference lists of systematic reviews, articles and health technology assessment reports. We asked investigators of the included trials for information about additional trials. The date of the last search of all databases was January 2017. \nSelection criteria\nWe included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with a duration of 12 weeks or more comparing DPP\u20104 inhibitors and GLP\u20101 analogues with any pharmacological glucose\u2010lowering intervention, behaviour\u2010changing intervention, placebo or no intervention in people with impaired fasting glucose, impaired glucose tolerance, moderately elevated HbA1c or combinations of these. \nData collection and analysis\nTwo review authors read all abstracts and full\u2010text articles and records, assessed quality and extracted outcome data independently. One review author extracted data which were checked by a second review author. We resolved discrepancies by consensus or the involvement of a third review author. For meta\u2010analyses, we planned to use a random\u2010effects model with investigation of risk ratios (RRs) for dichotomous outcomes and mean differences (MDs) for continuous outcomes, using 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for effect estimates. We assessed the overall quality of the evidence using the GRADE instrument. \nMain results\nWe included seven completed RCTs; about 98 participants were randomised to a DPP\u20104 inhibitor as monotherapy and 1620 participants were randomised to a GLP\u20101 analogue as monotherapy. Two trials investigated a DPP\u20104 inhibitor and five trials investigated a GLP\u20101 analogue. A total of 924 participants with data on allocation to control groups were randomised to a comparator group; 889 participants were randomised to placebo and 33 participants to metformin monotherapy. One RCT of liraglutide contributed 85% of all participants. The duration of the intervention varied from 12 weeks to 160 weeks. We judged none of the included trials at low risk of bias for all 'Risk of bias' domains and did not perform meta\u2010analyses because there were not enough trials. \nOne trial comparing the DPP\u20104 inhibitor vildagliptin with placebo reported no deaths (very low\u2010quality evidence). The incidence of T2DM by means of WHO diagnostic criteria in this trial was 3/90 participants randomised to vildagliptin versus 1/89 participants randomised to placebo (very low\u2010quality evidence). Also, 1/90 participants on vildagliptin versus 2/89 participants on placebo experienced a serious adverse event (very low\u2010quality evidence). One out of 90 participants experienced congestive heart failure in the vildagliptin group versus none in the placebo group (very low\u2010quality evidence). There were no data on non\u2010fatal myocardial infarction, stroke, health\u2010related quality of life or socioeconomic effects reported. \nAll\u2010cause and cardiovascular mortality following treatment with GLP\u20101 analogues were rarely reported; one trial of exenatide reported that no participant died. Another trial of liraglutide 3.0 mg showed that 2/1501 in the liraglutide group versus 2/747 in the placebo group died after 160 weeks of treatment (very low\u2010quality evidence). \nThe incidence of T2DM following treatment with liraglutide 3.0 mg compared to placebo after 160 weeks was 26/1472 (1.8%) participants randomised to liraglutide versus 46/738 (6.2%) participants randomised to placebo (very low\u2010quality evidence). The trial established the risk for (diagnosis of) T2DM as HbA1c 5.7% to 6.4% (6.5% or greater), fasting plasma glucose 5.6 mmol/L or greater to 6.9 mmol/L or less (7.0 mmol/L or greater) or two\u2010hour post\u2010load plasma glucose 7.8 mmol/L or greater to 11.0 mmol/L (11.1 mmol/L). Altogether, 70/1472 (66%) participants regressed from intermediate hyperglycaemia to normoglycaemia compared with 268/738 (36%) participants in the placebo group. The incidence of T2DM after the 12\u2010week off\u2010treatment extension period (i.e. after 172 weeks) showed that five additional participants were diagnosed T2DM in the liraglutide group, compared with one participant in the placebo group. After 12\u2010week treatment cessation, 740/1472 (50%) participants in the liraglutide group compared with 263/738 (36%) participants in the placebo group had normoglycaemia. \nOne trial used exenatide and 2/17 participants randomised to exenatide versus 1/16 participants randomised to placebo developed T2DM (very low\u2010quality evidence). This trial did not provide a definition of T2DM. One trial reported serious adverse events in 230/1524 (15.1%) participants in the liraglutide 3.0 mg arm versus 96/755 (12.7%) participants in the placebo arm (very low quality evidence). There were no serious adverse events in the trial using exenatide. Non\u2010fatal myocardial infarction was reported in 1/1524 participants in the liraglutide arm and in 0/55 participants in the placebo arm at 172 weeks (very low\u2010quality evidence). One trial reported congestive heart failure in 1/1524 participants in the liraglutide arm and in 1/755 participants in the placebo arm (very low\u2010quality evidence). Participants receiving liraglutide compared with placebo had a small mean improvement in the physical component of the 36\u2010item Short Form scale showing a difference of 0.87 points (95% CI 0.17 to 1.58; P = 0.02; 1 trial; 1791 participants; very low\u2010quality evidence). No trial evaluating GLP\u20101\u2010analogues reported data on stroke, microvascular complications or socioeconomic effects. \nAuthors' conclusions\nThere is no firm evidence that DPP\u20104 inhibitors or GLP\u20101 analogues compared mainly with placebo substantially influence the risk of T2DM and especially its associated complications in people at increased risk for the development of T2DM. Most trials did not investigate patient\u2010important outcomes. \n", "10.1002-14651858.CD006171.pub4-abstract.txt": "Background\nCongenital toxoplasmosis is considered a rare but potentially severe infection. Prenatal education about congenital toxoplasmosis could be the most efficient and least harmful intervention, yet its effectiveness is uncertain. \nObjectives\nTo assess the effects of prenatal education for preventing congenital toxoplasmosis.\nSearch methods\nWe searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (31 May 2015), and reference lists of relevant papers, reviews and websites. \nSelection criteria\nRandomized and quasi\u2010randomized controlled trials of all types of prenatal education on toxoplasmosis infection during pregnancy. Cluster\u2010randomized trials were eligible for inclusion. \nData collection and analysis\nTwo review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion and risk of bias, extracted data and checked them for accuracy. \nMain results\nTwo cluster\u2010randomized controlled trials (RCTs) (involving a total of 5455 women) met the inclusion criteria. The two included trials measured the effectiveness of the intervention in different ways, which meant that meta\u2010analysis of the results was not possible. The overall quality of the two studies, as assessed using the GRADE approach, was low, with high risk of detection and attrition bias in both included trials. \nOne trial (432 women enrolled) conducted in Canada was judged of low methodological quality. This trial did not report on any of the review's pre\u2010specified primary outcomes and the secondary outcomes reported results only as P values. Moreover, losses to follow\u2010up were high (34%, 147 out of 432 women initially enrolled). The authors concluded that prenatal education can effectively change pregnant women's behavior as it increased pet, personal and food hygiene. The second trial conducted in France was also judged of low methodological quality. Losses to follow\u2010up were also high (44.5%, 2233 out of 5023 women initially enrolled) and differential (40% in the intervention group and 52% in the control group). The authors concluded that prenatal education for congenital toxoplasmoses has a significant effect on improving women's knowledge, whereas it has no effect on changing women's behavior. In this trial 17/3949 pregnant women seroconverted for toxoplasmosis: 13/2591 (0.5%) in the intervention group and 4/1358 (0.3%) in the control group. The rate of seroconversion detected during the study did not differ between groups (risk ratio (RR) 1.70, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.56 to 5.21; participants = 3949; studies = one, low quality evidence). The number of events was too small to reach conclusions about the effect of prenatal education on seroconversion rate during pregnancy. \nNo other randomized trials on the effect of prenatal education on congenital toxoplasmosis rate, or toxoplasmosis seroconversion rate during pregnancy were detected. \nAuthors' conclusions\nEven though primary prevention of congenital toxoplasmosis is considered a desirable intervention, given the lack of related risks compared to secondary and tertiary prevention, its effectiveness has not been adequately evaluated. There is very little evidence from RCTs that prenatal education is effective in reducing congenital toxoplasmosis even though evidence from observational studies suggests it is. Given the lack of good evidence supporting prenatal education for congenital toxoplasmosis prevention, further RCTs are needed to confirm any potential benefits and to further quantify the impact of different sets of educational intervention. \n", "10.1002-14651858.CD003459.pub4-abstract.txt": "Background\nAlthough corticosteroids are effective for induction of remission of Crohn's disease, many patients relapse when steroids are withdrawn or become steroid dependent. Furthermore, corticosteroids exhibit significant adverse effects. The success of methotrexate as a treatment for rheumatoid arthritis led to its evaluation in patients with refractory Crohn's disease. Methotrexate has been studied for induction of remission of refractory Crohn's disease and has become the principal alternative to azathioprine or 6\u2010mercaptopurine therapy. This systematic review is an update of previously published Cochrane reviews. \nObjectives\nThe primary objective was to assess the efficacy and safety of methotrexate for induction of remission in patients with active Crohn's disease in the presence or absence of concomitant steroid therapy. \nSearch methods\nWe searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, CENTRAL and the Cochrane IBD/FBD group specialized register from inception to June 9, 2014 for relevant studies. Conference proceedings and reference lists were also searched to identify additional studies. \nSelection criteria\nRandomized controlled trials of methotrexate compared to placebo or an active comparator for treatment of active refractory Crohn's disease in adult patients (> 17 years) were considered for inclusion. \nData collection and analysis\nThe primary outcome was failure to enter remission and withdraw from steroids. Secondary outcomes included adverse events, withdrawal due to adverse events, serious adverse events and quality of life. We calculated the relative risk (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) for each outcome. Data were analyzed on an intention\u2010to\u2010treat basis. The Cochrane risk of bias tool was used to assess the methodological quality of included studies. The GRADE approach was used to assess the overall quality of evidence supporting the primary outcome. \nMain results\nSeven studies (495 patients) were included. Four studies were rated as low risk of bias. Three studies were rated as high risk of bias due to open label or single\u2010blind designs. The seven studies differed with respect to participants, intervention, and outcomes to the extent that meta\u2010analysis was considered to be inappropriate. GRADE analyses indicated that the quality of evidence was very low to low for most outcomes due to sparse data and inadequate blinding. Three small studies which employed low dose oral methotrexate showed no statistically significant difference in failure to induce remission between methotrexate and placebo or between methotrexate and 6\u2010mercaptopurine. For the study using 15 mg/week of oral methotrexate 33% (5/15) of methotrexate patients failed to enter remission compared to 11% (2/18) of placebo patients (RR 3.00, 95% CI 0.68 to 13.31). For the study using 12.5 mg/week of oral methotrexate 62% (16/26) of methotrexate patients failed to enter remission compared to 54% (14/26) of placebo patients (RR 1.14, 95% CI 0.72 to 1.82). This study also had an active comparator arm, 62% (16/26) of methotrexate patients failed to enter remission compared to 59% (19/32) of 6\u2010mercaptopurine patients (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.57). For the active comparator study using 15 mg/week oral methotrexate, 20% (3/15) of methotrexate patients failed to enter remission compared to 6% of 6\u2010mercaptopurine patients (RR 3.20, 95% CI 0.37 to 27.49). This study also had a 5\u2010ASA arm and found that methotrexate patients were significantly more likely to enter remission than 5\u2010ASA patients. Twenty per cent (3/15) of methotrexate patients failed to enter remission compared to 86% (6/7) of 5\u2010ASA patients (RR 0.23, 95% CI 0.08 to 0.67). One small study which used a higher dose of intravenous or oral methotrexate (25 mg/week) showed no statistically significant difference between methotrexate and azathioprine. Forty\u2010four per cent (12/27) of methotrexate patients failed to enter remission compared to 37% of azathioprine patients (RR 1.20, 95% CI 0.63 to 2.29). Two studies found no statistically significant difference in failure to enter remission between the combination of infliximab and methotrexate and infliximab monotherapy. One small study utilized intravenous methotrexate (20 mg/week) for 5 weeks and then switched to oral (20 mg/week). Forty\u2010five per cent (5/11) of patients in the combination group failed to enter remission compared to 62% of infliximab patients (RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.31 to 1.69). The other study assessing combination therapy utilized subcutaneous methotrexate (maximum dose 25 mg/week). Twenty\u2010four per cent (15/63) of patients in the combination group failed to enter remission compared to 22% (14/63) of infliximab patients (RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.57 to 2.03). A large placebo\u2010controlled study which employed a high dose of methotrexate intramuscularly showed a statistically significant benefit relative to placebo. Sixty\u2010one per cent of methotrexate patients failed to enter remission compared to 81% of placebo patients (RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.61 to 0.93; number needed to treat, NNT=5). Withdrawals due to adverse events were significantly more common in methotrexate patients than placebo in this study. Seventeen per cent of methotrexate patients withdrew due to adverse events compared to 2% of placebo patients (RR 8.00, 95% CI 1.09 to 58.51). The incidence of adverse events was significantly more common in methotrexate patients (63%, 17/27) than azathioprine patients (26%, 7/27) in one small study (RR 2.42, 95% CI 1.21 to 4.89). No other statistically significant differences in adverse events, withdrawals due to adverse events or serious adverse events were reported in any of the other placebo\u2010controlled or active comparator studies. Common adverse events included nausea and vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea, skin rash and headache. \nAuthors' conclusions\nThere is evidence from a single large randomized trial which suggests that intramuscular methotrexate (25 mg/week) provides a benefit for induction of remission and complete withdrawal from steroids in patients with refractory Crohn's disease. Lower dose oral methotrexate does not appear to provide any significant benefit relative to placebo or active comparator. However, these trials were small and further studies of oral methotrexate may be justified. Comparative studies of methotrexate to drugs such as azathioprine or 6\u2010mercaptopurine would require the randomization of large numbers of patients. The addition of methotrexate to infliximab therapy does not appear to provide any additional benefit over infliximab monotherapy. However these studies were relatively small and further research is needed to determine the role of methotrexate when used in conjunction with infliximab or other biological therapies. \n", "10.1002-14651858.CD007726.pub3-abstract.txt": "Background\nAntipsychotic agents are often used to treat neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) in people with dementia although there is uncertainty about the effectiveness of their long\u2010term use for this indication and concern that they may cause harm, including higher mortality. When behavioural strategies have failed and treatment with antipsychotic drugs is instituted, regular attempts to withdraw them have been recommended in guidelines. Physicians, nurses and families of older people with dementia may be reluctant to stop antipsychotics, fearing deterioration of NPS. \nThis is an update of a Cochrane Review published in 2013.\nObjectives\nTo evaluate whether withdrawal of antipsychotic agents is successful in older people with dementia and NPS in primary care or nursing home settings, to list the different strategies for withdrawal of antipsychotic agents in older participants with dementia and NPS, and to measure the effects of withdrawal of antipsychotic agents on participants' behaviour and assess safety. \nSearch methods\nWe searched the Specialized Register of the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group (ALOIS), the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL, LILACS, clinical trials registries and grey literature sources up to 11 January 2018. \nSelection criteria\nWe included all randomised, controlled trials comparing an antipsychotic withdrawal strategy to continuation of antipsychotics in people with dementia who had been treated with an antipsychotic drug for at least three months. \nData collection and analysis\nWe used standard methodological procedures according to the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions. We rated the quality of evidence for each outcome using the GRADE approach. \nMain results\nWe included 10 studies involving 632 participants. One new trial (19 participants) was added for this update. \nOne trial was conducted in a community setting, eight in nursing homes and one in both settings. Different types of antipsychotics at varying doses were discontinued in the studies. Both abrupt and gradual withdrawal schedules were used. Reported data were predominantly from studies at low or unclear risk of bias. \nWe included nine trials with 575 randomised participants that used a proxy outcome for overall success of antipsychotic withdrawal. Pooling data was not possible due to heterogeneity of outcome measures used. Based on assessment of seven studies, discontinuation may make little or no difference to whether or not participants complete the study (low\u2010quality evidence). \nTwo trials included only participants with psychosis, agitation or aggression who had responded to antipsychotic treatment. In these two trials, stopping antipsychotics was associated with a higher risk of leaving the study early due to symptomatic relapse or a shorter time to symptomatic relapse. \nWe found low\u2010quality evidence that discontinuation may make little or no difference to overall NPS, measured using various scales (7 trials, 519 participants). There was some evidence from subgroup analyses in two trials that discontinuation may reduce agitation for participants with less severe NPS at baseline, but may be associated with a worsening of NPS in participants with more severe NPS at baseline. \nNone of the studies assessed withdrawal symptoms. Adverse effects of antipsychotics (such as falls) were not systematically assessed. Low\u2010quality evidence showed that discontinuation may have little or no effect on adverse events (5 trials, 381 participants), quality of life (2 trials, 119 participants), or cognitive function (5 trials, 365 participants). \nThere were insufficient data to determine whether discontinuation of antipsychotics has any effect on mortality (very low\u2010quality evidence). \nAuthors' conclusions\nThere is low\u2010quality evidence that antipsychotics may be successfully discontinued in older people with dementia and NPS who have been taking antipsychotics for at least three months, and that discontinuation may have little or no important effect on behavioural and psychological symptoms. This is consistent with the observation that most behavioural complications of dementia are intermittent and often do not persist for longer than three months. Discontinuation may have little or no effect on overall cognitive function. Discontinuation may make no difference to adverse events and quality of life. Based on the trials in this review, we are uncertain whether discontinuation of antipsychotics leads to a decrease in mortality. \nPeople with psychosis, aggression or agitation who responded well to long\u2010term antipsychotic drug use, or those with more severe NPS at baseline, may benefit behaviourally from continuation of antipsychotics. Discontinuation may reduce agitation for people with mild NPS at baseline. However, these conclusions are based on few studies or small subgroups and further evidence of benefits and harms associated with withdrawal of antipsychotic is required in people with dementia and mild and severe NPS. \nThe overall conclusions of the review have not changed since 2013 and the number of available trials remains low. \n", "10.1002-14651858.CD008819.pub4-abstract.txt": "Background\nCompression hosiery or stockings are often the first line of treatment for varicose veins in people without either healed or active venous ulceration. Evidence is required to determine whether the use of compression stockings can effectively manage and treat varicose veins in the early stages. This is the second update of a review first published in 2011. \nObjectives\nTo assess the effectiveness of compression stockings for the only and initial treatment of varicose veins in people without healed or active venous ulceration. \nSearch methods\nFor this update, the Cochrane Vascular Information Specialist searched the Cochrane Vascular Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, and AMED databases and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform and ClinicalTrials.gov trials registers to 12 May 2020. We also checked references of studies identified from the literature searches. \nSelection criteria\nWe included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) involving people diagnosed with primary trunk varicose veins without healed or active venous ulceration (Clinical, Etiology, Anatomy, Pathophysiology (CEAP) classification C2 to C4). Included trials assessed compression stockings versus no treatment or placebo stockings, or compression stockings plus drug intervention versus drug intervention alone. We also included trials comparing different lengths and pressures of stockings. We excluded trials involving other types of treatment for varicose veins (either as a comparator to stockings or as an initial non\u2010randomised treatment), including sclerotherapy and surgery. \nData collection and analysis\nWe followed standard Cochrane methodology. Two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion, extracted data, assessed risk of bias and assessed the certainty of the evidence using GRADE. Outcomes of interest were change in symptoms; physiological measures; complications; compliance; comfort, tolerance and acceptability of wearing stockings; and quality of life. \nMain results\nWe included 13 studies with 1021 participants with varicose veins without healed or active venous ulceration. One study included pregnant women while other studies included participants who had sought medical intervention for their varicose veins by being on surgical waiting lists, or attending vascular surgery or dermatology clinics or outpatient departments. The stockings used in the studies exerted different levels of pressure, ranging from 10 mmHg to 50 mmHg. Five studies assessed compression stockings versus no compression stockings or placebo stockings. Three of these studies used knee\u2010length stockings, one used full\u2010length stockings and one used full tights. Eight studies compared different types or pressures of knee\u2010length stockings. The risk of bias of many included trials was unclear, mainly because of inadequate reporting. We were unable to pool studies as they did not report the same outcomes or used different ways to assess them. Many studies were small and there were differences in the populations studied. The certainty of the evidence was therefore low to very low. \nCompression stockings compared with no treatment or placebo stockings \nAll four studies that reported change in symptoms found a subjective improvement by the end of the study. However, change in symptoms was not always analysed by comparing the randomised arms of the studies and was therefore subject to bias. Two studies assessed physiological measures using either ankle circumference or duplex sonography to measure oedema. Ankle circumference showed no clear difference between baseline and follow\u2010up while oedema was reduced in the stocking group compared with the placebo stocking group. Three studies reported complications or side effects with itching and irritation the main side effects reported. None of the trials reported severe side effects. Reports of compliance varied between studies. One study reported a high dropout rate with low levels of compliance due to discomfort, application and appearance; two studies reported generally good levels of compliance in the stocking group compared to placebo/no treatment. Two studies reported comfort, tolerance and acceptability with outcomes affected by the study population. Compression tights were increasingly rejected by pregnant women as their pregnancy progressed, while in one study of non\u2010pregnant women, the stockings group showed no more hindrance of normal activities and daytime discomfort when compared with placebo stockings. One study reported quality of life showing no clear differences between the stocking and placebo stocking groups. \nCompression stockings compared with different compression stockings \nAll five studies that reported change in symptoms found a subjective improvement in symptoms by the end of the study. Change in symptoms was not always analysed comparing the randomised arms of the trials and was therefore subject to bias. Five studies reported a variety of physiological measures such as foot volumetry, volume reduction and change in diameter. Generally, there were no clear differences between study arms. Four studies reported complications or side effects, including sweating, itching, skin dryness, and constriction and tightness. None of the trials reported severe side effects. Two studies reported compliance showing no difference in compliance rates between stockings groups, although one study reported high initial levels of dropout due to discomfort, appearance, non\u2010effectiveness and irritation. Four studies reported comfort, tolerance and acceptability. Two studies reported similar levels of tolerance and discomfort between groups. Discomfort was the main reason for indicating a preference for one type of stocking over another. None of the studies assessed quality of life. \nNo conclusions regarding the optimum length or pressure of compression stockings could be made as there were no conclusive results from the included studies. \nAuthors' conclusions\nThere is insufficient high\u2010certainty evidence to determine whether or not compression stockings are effective as the sole and initial treatment of varicose veins in people without healed or active venous ulceration, or whether any type of stocking is superior to any other type. Future research should consist of large RCTs of participants with trunk varices either wearing or not wearing compression stockings to assess the efficacy of this intervention. If compression stockings are found to be beneficial, further studies assessing which length and pressure is the most efficacious could then take place. \n", "10.1002-14651858.CD004957.pub3-abstract.txt": "Background\nJoint replacements are common procedures and treatment of choice for those with intractable joint pain and disability arising from arthropathy of the hip or knee.

There were no trials addressing outpatient centre\u2010based programmes. Pooling of data was not possible due to differences in study design and outcomes used. Methodological assessment showed all trials were of low quality.

No trials addressed longer\u2010term outcomes following hip replacement only. \nAuthors' conclusions\nBased on the heterogeneity and the low quality of the included trials that precluded pooled meta\u2010analysis, there is silver level evidence that following hip or knee joint replacement, early multidisciplinary rehabilitation can improve outcomes at the level of activity and participation. The optimal intensity, frequency and effects of rehabilitation over a longer period and associated social costs need further study. Future research should focus on improving methodological and scientific rigour of clinical trials, and use of standardised outcome measures, so that results can be pooled for statistical analysis. \n", "10.1002-14651858.CD002201.pub6-abstract.txt": "Background\nStudies suggest that a diet rich in omega\u20103 essential fatty acids may have beneficial anti\u2010inflammatory effects for chronic conditions such as cystic fibrosis.

The quality of the evidence was assessed using GRADE. \nMain results\nThe searches identified 23 studies; five studies with 106 participants (children and adults) were included; duration of studies and interventions differed. Two studies compared omega\u20103 fatty acids to olive oil for six weeks; one study compared omega\u20103 fatty acids and omega\u20106 fatty acids to control capsules (customised fatty acid blends) for three months; one study compared a liquid dietary supplement containing omega\u20103 fatty acids to one without for six months; and one study compared omega\u20103 fatty acids to a placebo for 12 months. Three studies had a low risk of bias for randomisation, but the risk was unclear in the remaining two studies; all studies had an unclear risk of bias for allocation concealment. Three of the studies adequately blinded participants; the risk of bias for selective reporting was high in one study and unclear for four studies. \nTwo studies reported the number of respiratory exacerbations. At three months, one study (43 participants) reported no change in antibiotic usage. At 12 months the second study (15 participants) reported a reduction in the number of pulmonary exacerbations and cumulative antibiotic days in the supplement group compared to the previous year (no data for the control group); very low\u2010quality evidence means we are unsure whether supplementation has any effect on this outcome. \nWith regards to adverse events, one six\u2010week study (12 participants) reported no difference in diarrhoea between omega\u20103 or placebo capsules; the very low\u2010quality evidence means we are unsure if supplementation has any effect on this outcome. Additionally, one study reported an increase in steatorrhoea requiring participants to increase their daily dose of pancreatic enzymes, but three studies had already increased pancreatic enzyme dose at study begin so as to reduce the incidence of steatorrhoea. One study (43 participants) reported stomach pains at three months (treatment or control group not specified). One six\u2010week study (19 participants) reported three asthma exacerbations leading to exclusion of participants since corticosteroid treatment could affect affect essential fatty acid metabolism. \nFour studies reported lung function. One six\u2010week study (19 participants) reported an increase in forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) (L) and forced vital capacity (FVC) (L), but the very low\u2010quality evidence means we are unsure if supplementation has any effect on lung function. The remaining studies did not report any difference in lung function at three months (unit of measurement not specified) or at six months and one year (FEV1 % predicted and FVC % predicted). \nNo deaths were reported in any of the five studies. Four studies reported clinical variables. One study reported an increase in Schwachman score and weight alongside a reduction in sputum volume with supplementation compared to placebo at three months (data not analysable). However, three studies reported no differences in either weight at six weeks, in body mass index (BMI) standard deviation (SD) score at six months (very low\u2010quality evidence) or BMI Z score at 12 months. \nThree studies reported biochemical markers of fatty acid status. One study showed an increase from baseline in both EPA and DHA content of serum phospholipids in the omega\u20103 group compared to placebo at three months and also a significant decrease in n\u20106/n\u20103 ratio in the supplement group compared to placebo; since the quality of the evidence is very low we are not certain that these changes are due to supplementation. One six\u2010month cross\u2010over study showed a higher EPA content of the neutrophil membrane in the supplement group compared to the placebo group, but, no difference in DHA membrane concentration. Furthermore, the leukotriene B4 to leukotriene B5 ratio was lower at six months in the omega\u20103 group compared to placebo. A one\u2010year study reported a greater increase in the essential fatty acid profile and a decrease in AA levels in the treatment arm compared to placebo. \nAuthors' conclusions\nThis review found that regular omega\u20103 supplements may provide some limited benefits for people with cystic fibrosis with relatively few adverse effects: however, the quality of the evidence across all outcomes was very low. The current evidence is insufficient to draw firm conclusions or recommend routine use of these supplements in people with cystic fibrosis. A large, long\u2010term, multicentre, randomised controlled study is needed to determine any significant therapeutic effect and to assess the influence of disease severity, dosage and duration of treatment. Future researchers should note the need for additional pancreatic enzymes when providing omega\u20103 supplementation or olive oil placebo capsules. More research is required to determine the exact dose of pancreatic enzyme required. \n", "10.1002-14651858.CD005088.pub4-abstract.txt": "Background\nOsteogenesis imperfecta is caused by a genetic defect resulting in an abnormal type I collagen bone matrix which typically results in multiple fractures with little or no trauma. Bisphosphonates are used in an attempt to increase bone mineral density and reduce these fractures in people with osteogenesis imperfecta. This is an update of a previously published Cochrane Review. \nObjectives\nTo assess the effectiveness and safety of bisphosphonates in increasing bone mineral density, reducing fractures and improving clinical function in people with osteogenesis imperfecta. \nSearch methods\nWe searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Inborn Errors of Metabolism Trials Register which comprises references identified from comprehensive electronic database searches, handsearches of journals and conference proceedings. We additionally searched PubMed and major conference proceedings. \nDate of the most recent search of the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group's Inborn Errors of Metabolism Register: 28 April 2016. \nSelection criteria\nRandomised and quasi\u2010randomised controlled trials comparing bisphosphonates to placebo, no treatment, or comparator interventions in all types of osteogenesis imperfecta. \nData collection and analysis\nTwo authors independently extracted data and assessed the risk of bias of the included trials. \nMain results\nFourteen trials (819 participants) were included. Overall, the trials were mainly at a low risk of bias, although selective reporting was an issue in several of the trials. Data for oral bisphosphonates versus placebo could not be aggregated; a statistically significant difference favouring oral bisphosphonates in fracture risk reduction and number of fractures was noted in two trials. No differences were reported in the remaining three trials which commented on fracture incidence. Five trials reported data for spine bone mineral density; all found statistically significant increased lumbar spine density z scores for at least one time point studied. For intravenous bisphosphonates versus placebo, aggregated data from two trials showed no statistically significant difference for the number of participants with at least one fracture, risk ratio 0.56 (95% confidence interval 0.30 to 1.06). In the remaining trial no statistically significant difference was noted in fracture incidence. For spine bone mineral density, no statistically significant difference was noted in the aggregated data from two trials, mean difference 9.96 (95% confidence interval \u20102.51 to 22.43). In the remaining trial a statistically significant difference in mean per cent change in spine bone mineral density z score favoured intravenous bisphosphonates at six and 12 months. Data describing growth, bone pain, and functional outcomes after oral or intravenous bisphosphonate therapy, or both, as compared to placebo were incomplete among all studies, but do not show consistent improvements in these outcomes. Two studies compared different doses of bisphosphonates. No differences were found between doses when bone mineral density, fractures, and height or length z score were assessed. One trial compared oral versus intravenous bisphosphonates and found no differences in primary outcomes. Two studies compared the intravenous bisphosphonates zoledronic acid and pamidronate. There were no significant differences in primary outcome. However, the studies were at odds as to the relative benefit of zoledronic acid over pamidronate for lumbosacral bone mineral density at 12 months. \nAuthors' conclusions\nBisphophonates are commonly prescribed to individuals with osteogenesis imperfecta. Current evidence, albeit limited, demonstrates oral or intravenous bisphosphonates increase bone mineral density in children and adults with this condition. These were not shown to be different in their ability to increase bone mineral density. It is unclear whether oral or intravenous bisphosphonate treatment consistently decreases fractures, though multiple studies report this independently and no studies report an increased fracture rate with treatment. The studies included here do not show bisphosphonates conclusively improve clinical status (reduce pain; improve growth and functional mobility) in people with osteogenesis imperfecta. Given their current widespread and expected continued use, the optimal method, duration of therapy and long\u2010term safety of bisphosphonate therapy require further investigation. In addition, attention should be given to long\u2010term fracture reduction and improvement in quality of life indicators. \n", "10.1002-14651858.CD011391.pub2-abstract.txt": "Background\nSurgical resection is currently the only treatment with the potential for long\u2010term survival and cure of pancreatic cancer. Surgical resection is provided as distal pancreatectomy for cancers of the body and tail of the pancreas. It can be performed by laparoscopic or open surgery. In operations on other organs, laparoscopic surgery has been shown to reduce complications and length of hospital stay as compared with open surgery. However, concerns remain about the safety of laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy compared with open distal pancreatectomy in terms of postoperative complications and oncological clearance. \nObjectives\nTo assess the benefits and harms of laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy versus open distal pancreatectomy for people undergoing distal pancreatectomy for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma of the body or tail of the pancreas, or both. \nSearch methods\nWe used search strategies to search the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, Science Citation Index Expanded and trials registers until June 2015 to identify randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and non\u2010randomised studies.

We included in this review 12 non\u2010randomised studies that compared laparoscopic versus open distal pancreatectomy (1576 participants: 394 underwent laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy and 1182 underwent open distal pancreatectomy); 11 studies (1506 participants: 353 undergoing laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy and 1153 undergoing open distal pancreatectomy) provided information for one or more outcomes. All of these studies were retrospective cohort\u2010like studies or case\u2010control studies.

None of the included studies reported quality of life at any point in time, recurrence within six months, time to return to normal activity and time to return to work or blood transfusion requirements. \nAuthors' conclusions\nCurrently, no randomised controlled trials have compared laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy versus open distal pancreatectomy for patients with pancreatic cancers. In observational studies, laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy has been associated with shorter hospital stay as compared with open distal pancreatectomy. Currently, no information is available to determine a causal association in the differences between laparoscopic versus open distal pancreatectomy. Observed differences may be a result of confounding due to laparoscopic operation on less extensive cancer and open surgery on more extensive cancer. In addition, differences in length of hospital stay are relevant only if laparoscopic and open surgery procedures are equivalent oncologically. This information is not available currently. Thus, randomised controlled trials are needed to compare laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy versus open distal pancreatectomy with at least two to three years of follow\u2010up. Such studies should include patient\u2010oriented outcomes such as short\u2010term mortality and long\u2010term mortality (at least two to three years); health\u2010related quality of life; complications and the sequelae of complications; resection margins; measures of earlier postoperative recovery such as length of hospital stay, time to return to normal activity and time to return to work (in those who are employed); and recurrence of cancer. \n", "10.1002-14651858.CD012030.pub2-abstract.txt": "Background\nFatigue is a prevalent and burdensome symptom for patients with incurable cancer receiving cancer treatment with palliative intent and is associated with reduced quality of life.

The date of our most recent search was 29 November 2016. \nSelection criteria\nWe included randomised controlled trials that compared psychosocial interventions in adults aged 18 years or over undergoing cancer treatment with palliative intent for incurable cancer versus usual care or other controls. Psychosocial interventions were defined as various kinds of interventions provided to influence or change cognitions, emotions, behaviours, social interactions, or a combination of these. Psychosocial interventions of interest to this review had to involve at least two interactions between the patient and the care provider in which the care provider gave the patient personal feedback concerning changes sought by these interventions. We included trials that reported fatigue as an outcome of interest. \nData collection and analysis\nWe used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Two review authors independently considered trials for inclusion in the review, assessed risk of bias, and extracted data, including information on adverse events.

Researchers investigated a broad range of psychosocial interventions with different intervention aims and durations. We identified sources of potential bias, including lack of description of methods of blinding and allocation concealment and inclusion of small study populations. \nFindings from our meta\u2010analysis do not support the effectiveness of psychosocial interventions for reducing fatigue post intervention (standardised mean difference (SMD) \u20100.25, 95% confidence interval (CI) \u20100.50 to 0.00; not significant; 535 participants, 12 studies; very low\u2010quality evidence).

These findings were not sustained at first follow\u2010up (SMD 0.37, 95% CI \u20100.20 to 0.94; not significant; 122 participants, two studies; very low\u2010quality evidence). Findings do not support the effectiveness of psychosocial interventions for improving social functioning (mean difference (MD) 4.16, 95% CI \u201011.20 to 19.53; not significant; 141 participants, four studies), role functioning (MD 3.49, 95% CI \u201012.78 to 19.76; not significant; 143 participants, four studies), emotional functioning (SMD \u20100.11, 95% CI \u20100.56 to 0.35; not significant; 115 participants, three studies), or cognitive functioning (MD \u20102.23, 95% CI \u201012.52 to 8.06; not significant; 86 participants, two studies) post intervention. Only three studies evaluated adverse events. These studies found no difference between the number of adverse events among participants in the intervention versus control group. \nUsing GRADE, we considered the overall quality of evidence for our primary and secondary outcomes to be very low. Therefore, we have very little confidence in the effect estimate, and the true effect is likely to be substantially different from the estimate of effect. Limitations in study quality and imprecision due to sparse data resulted in downgrading of the quality of data. Additionally, most studies were at high risk of bias owing to their small sample size for the subset of patients with incurable cancer (fewer than 50 participants per arm), leading to uncertainty about effect estimates. \nAuthors' conclusions\nWe found little evidence around the benefits of psychosocial interventions provided to reduce fatigue in adult patients with incurable cancer receiving cancer treatment with palliative intent.

We used GRADE to assess evidence quality for each outcome. \nMain results\nWe included 10 studies with 8278 men in our analysis comparing hypofractionation with conventional fractionation to treat prostate cancer. \nPrimary outcomes \nHypofractionation may result in little or no difference in prostate cancer\u2010specific survival [PC\u2010SS] (HR 1.00, 95% CI 0.72 to 1.39; studies = 8, participants = 7946; median follow\u2010up 72 months; low\u2010certainty evidence). For men in the intermediate\u2010risk group undergoing conventional fractionation this corresponds to 976 per 1000 men alive after 6 years and 0 more (44 fewer to 18 more) alive per 1000 men undergoing hypofractionation. \nWe are uncertain about the effect of hypofractionation on late radiation therapy gastrointestinal (GI) toxicity (RR 1.10, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.78; studies = 4, participants = 3843; very low\u2010certainty evidence). \nHypofractionation probably results in little or no difference to late radiation therapy genitourinary (GU) toxicity (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.18; studies = 4, participants = 3843; moderate\u2010certainty evidence). This corresponds to 262 per 1000 late GU radiation therapy toxicity events with conventional fractionation and 13 more (18 fewer to 47 more) per 1000 men when undergoing hypofractionation. \nSecondary outcomes \nHypofractionation results in little or no difference in overall survival (HR 0.94, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.07; 10 studies, 8243 participants; high\u2010certainty evidence). For men in the intermediate\u2010risk group undergoing conventional fractionation this corresponds to 869 per 1000 men alive after 6 years and 17 fewer (54 fewer to 17 more) participants alive per 1000 men when undergoing hypofractionation. \nHypofractionation may result in little to no difference in metastasis\u2010free survival (HR 1.07, 95% CI 0.65 to 1.76; 5 studies, 4985 participants; low\u2010certainty evidence). This corresponds to 981 men per 1000 men metastasis\u2010free at 6 years when undergoing conventional fractionation and 5 more (58 fewer to 19 more) metastasis\u2010free per 1000 when undergoing hypofractionation. \nHypofractionation likely results in a small, possibly unimportant reduction in biochemical recurrence\u2010free survival based on Phoenix criteria (HR 0.88, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.13; studies = 5, participants = 2889; median follow\u2010up 90 months to 108 months; moderate\u2010certainty evidence). In men of the intermediate\u2010risk group, this corresponds to 804 biochemical\u2010recurrence free men per 1000 participants at six years with conventional fractionation and 42 fewer (134 fewer to 37 more) recurrence\u2010free men per 1000 participants with hypofractionation \nHypofractionation likely results in little to no difference to acute GU radiation therapy toxicity (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.11; 4 studies, 4174 participants at 12 to 18 weeks' follow\u2010up; moderate\u2010certainty evidence). This corresponds to 360 episodes of toxicity per 1000 participants with conventional fractionation and 11 more (18 fewer to 40 more) per 1000 when undergoing hypofractionation. \nAuthors' conclusions\nThese findings suggest that moderate hypofractionation (up to a fraction size of 3.4 Gy) results in similar oncologic outcomes in terms of disease\u2010specific, metastasis\u2010free and overall survival. There appears to be little to no increase in both acute and late toxicity. \n", "10.1002-14651858.CD012853.pub2-abstract.txt": "Background\nCrohn's disease (CD) is a chronic immune\u2010mediated condition of transmural inflammation in the gastrointestinal tract, associated with significant morbidity and decreased quality of life. The endocannabinoid system provides a potential therapeutic target for cannabis and cannabinoids and animal models have shown benefit in decreasing inflammation. However, there is also evidence to suggest transient adverse events such as weakness, dizziness and diarrhea, and an increased risk of surgery in people with CD who use cannabis. \nObjectives\nThe objectives were to assess the efficacy and safety of cannabis and cannabinoids for induction and maintenance of remission in people with CD. \nSearch methods\nWe searched MEDLINE, Embase, AMED, PsychINFO, the Cochrane IBD Group Specialized Register, CENTRAL, ClinicalTrials.Gov, and the European Clinical Trials Register up to 17 October 2018. We searched conference abstracts, references and we also contacted researchers in this field for upcoming publications. \nSelection criteria\nRandomized controlled trials comparing any form of cannabis or its cannabinoid derivatives (natural or synthetic) to placebo or an active therapy for adults with Crohn\u2019s disease were included. \nData collection and analysis\nTwo authors independently screened search results, extracted data and assessed bias using the Cochrane risk of bias tool. The primary outcomes were clinical remission and relapse. Remission is commonly defined as a Crohn's disease activity index (CDAI) of < 150. Relapse is defined as a CDAI > 150. Secondary outcomes included clinical response, endoscopic remission, endoscopic improvement, histological improvement, quality of life, C\u2010reactive protein (CRP) and fecal calprotectin measurements, adverse events (AEs), serious AEs, withdrawal due to AEs, and cannabis dependence and withdrawal effects. We calculated the risk ratio (RR) and corresponding 95% confidence interval (95% CI) for dichotomous outcomes. For continuous outcomes, we calculated the mean difference (MD) and 95% CI. Data were combined for analysis when the interventions, patient groups and outcomes were sufficiently similar (determined by consensus). Data were analyzed on an intention\u2010to\u2010treat basis and the overall certainty of the evidence supporting the outcomes was evaluated using the GRADE criteria. \nMain results\nThree studies (93 participants) that assessed cannabis in people with active CD met the inclusion criteria. One ongoing study was also identified. Participants in two of the studies were adults with active Crohn's disease who had failed at least one medical treatment. The inclusion criteria for the third study were unclear. No studies that assessed cannabis therapy in quiescent CD were identified. The studies were not pooled due to differences in the interventional drug. \nOne small study (N = 21) compared eight weeks of treatment with cannabis cigarettes containing 115 mg of D9\u2010tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) to placebo cigarettes containing cannabis with the THC removed in participants with active CD. This study was rated as high risk of bias for blinding and other bias (cannabis participants were older than placebo). The effects of cannabis on clinical remission were unclear. Forty\u2010five per cent (5/11) of the cannabis group achieved clinical remission compared with 10% (1/10) of the placebo group (RR 4.55, 95% CI 0.63 to 32.56; very low certainty evidence). A difference was observed in clinical response (decrease in CDAI score of >100 points) rates. Ninety\u2010one per cent (10/11) of the cannabis group achieved a clinical response compared to 40% (4/10) of the placebo group (RR 2.27, 95% CI 1.04 to 4.97; very low certainty evidence). More AEs were observed in the cannabis cigarette group compared to placebo (RR 4.09, 95% CI 1.15 to 14.57; very low certainty evidence). These AEs were considered to be mild in nature and included sleepiness, nausea, difficulty with concentration, memory loss, confusion and dizziness. This study did not report on serious AEs or withdrawal due to AEs. \nOne small study (N = 22) compared cannabis oil (5% cannabidiol) to placebo oil in people with active CD. This study was rated as high risk of bias for other bias (cannabis participants were more likely than placebo participants to be smokers). There was no difference in clinical remission rates. Forty per cent (4/10) of cannabis oil participants achieved remission at 8 weeks compared to 33% (3/9) of the placebo participants (RR 1.20, 95% CI 0.36 to 3.97; very low certainty evidence). There was no difference in the proportion of participants who had a serious adverse event. Ten per cent (1/10) of participants in the cannabis oil group had a serious adverse event compared to 11% (1/9) of placebo participants (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.07 to 12.38, very low certainty evidence). Both serious AEs were worsening Crohn's disease that required rescue intervention. This study did not report on clinical response, CRP, quality of life or withdrawal due to AEs. \nOne small study (N= 50) compared cannabis oil (15% cannabidiol and 4% THC) to placebo in participants with active CD. This study was rated as low risk of bias. Differences in CDAI and quality of life scores measured by the SF\u201036 instrument were observed. The mean quality of life score after 8 weeks of treatment was 96.3 in the cannabis oil group compared to 79.9 in the placebo group (MD 16.40, 95% CI 5.72 to 27.08, low certainty evidence). After 8 weeks of treatment, the mean CDAI score was118.6 in the cannabis oil group compared to 212.6 in the placebo group (MD \u201094.00, 95%CI \u2010148.86 to \u201039.14, low certainty evidence). This study did not report on clinical remission, clinical response, CRP or AEs. \nAuthors' conclusions\nThe effects of cannabis and cannabis oil on Crohn's disease are uncertain. Thus no firm conclusions regarding the efficacy and safety of cannabis and cannabis oil in adults with active Crohn's disease can be drawn. The effects of cannabis or cannabis oil in quiescent Crohn's disease have not been investigated. Further studies with larger numbers of participants are required to assess the potential benefits and harms of cannabis in Crohn's disease. Future studies should assess the effects of cannabis in people with active and quiescent Crohn's disease. Different doses of cannabis and delivery modalities should be investigated. \n", "10.1002-14651858.CD011636.pub2-abstract.txt": "Background\nPreterm birth remains the major risk factor for the development of intraventricular hemorrhage, an injury that occurs in 25% of very low birth weight infants. Intraventricular hemorrhage is thought to be venous in origin and intrinsic thromboses in the germinal matrix are likely to play a triggering role. Antithrombin, a glycoprotein synthesized in the liver, is the major plasma inhibitor of thrombin thus modulating blood coagulation. Very low birth weight newborn infants have low levels of antithrombin and the risk of developing intraventricular hemorrhage is increased by the presence of hypercoagulability in the first hours of life. The administration of anticoagulants such as antithrombin may offset the increased risk of developing intraventricular hemorrhage. Anticoagulants may also reduce the risk of developing parenchymal venous infarct, a condition known to complicate intraventricular hemorrhage. \nObjectives\nTo assess whether the prophylactic administration of antithrombin (started within the first 24 hours after birth) reduces the incidence of germinal matrix\u2010intraventricular hemorrhage in very preterm neonates when compared to placebo, no treatment, or heparin. \nSearch methods\nWe searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library 2015), MEDLINE (1996 to 22 November 2015), EMBASE (1980 to 22 November 2015), and CINAHL (1982 to 22 November 2015). No language restrictions were applied. We searched the abstracts of the major congresses in the field (Perinatal Society of Australia and New Zealand and Pediatric Academic Societies) from 2000 to 2015. \nSelection criteria\nRandomised controlled trials, quasi\u2010randomised controlled trials and cluster trials comparing the administration of early, i.e. within the first 24 hours of life, antithrombin in very preterm infants (gestational age < 32 weeks, any birth weight). \nData collection and analysis\nFor each of the included trials, two authors independently extracted data (e.g. number of participants, birth weight, gestational age, antithrombin formulation (plasma\u2010derived or recombinant), mode of administration, and duration of therapy, etc.) and assessed the risk of bias (e.g. adequacy of randomization, blinding, completeness of follow\u2010up). The primary outcomes considered in this review are intraventricular hemorrhage and severe intraventricular hemorrhage. \nMain results\nTwo randomized controlled trials, for a total of 182 infants, met the inclusion criteria of this review. Both trials compared antithrombin with placebo. We found no significant differences in the rates of intraventricular hemorrhage (typical RR 1.30, CI 95% 0.87 to 1.93, typical RD 0.09, 95% CI \u22120.05 to 0.23; 2 studies, 175 infants; I\u00b2 = 18% for RR and I\u00b2 = 42% for RD) and severe intraventricular hemorrhage (typical RR 1.04, CI 95% 0.55 to 1.94; typical RD 0.01, 95% CI \u22120.11 to 0.12; 2 studies, 175 infants; I\u00b2 = 0% for RR and I\u00b2 = 0% for RD). Among secondary outcomes, we found no significant differences in terms of neonatal mortality (typical RR 2.00, CI 95% 0.62 to 6.45; typical RD 0.04, 95% CI \u22120.03 to 0.12; 2 studies, 182 infants; I\u00b2 = 46% for RR and I\u00b2 = 61% for RD) and in the other specified outcomes, such as bronchopulmonary dysplasia. The quality of the evidence supporting these findings is limited due to the imprecision of the estimates. \nAuthors' conclusions\nThe administration of antithrombin seems not to reduce the incidence and severity of intraventricular hemorrhage in very preterm infants. Limited evidence is available on other clinically relevant outcomes. Given the imprecision of the estimate, the results of this systematic review are consistent with either a benefit or a detrimental effect of antithrombin and do not provide a definitive answer to the review question. \n", "10.1002-14651858.CD009567.pub2-abstract.txt": "Background\nAcute high altitude illness is defined as a group of cerebral and pulmonary syndromes that can occur during travel to high altitudes. It is more common above 2500 metres, but can be seen at lower elevations, especially in susceptible people. Acute high altitude illness includes a wide spectrum of syndromes defined under the terms 'acute mountain sickness' (AMS), 'high altitude cerebral oedema' and 'high altitude pulmonary oedema'. There are several interventions available to treat this condition, both pharmacological and non\u2010pharmacological; however, there is a great uncertainty regarding their benefits and harms. \nObjectives\nTo assess the clinical effectiveness, and safety of interventions (non\u2010pharmacological and pharmacological), as monotherapy or in any combination, for treating acute high altitude illness. \nSearch methods\nWe searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, LILACS, ISI Web of Science, CINAHL, Wanfang database and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform for ongoing studies on 10 August 2017. We did not apply any language restriction. \nSelection criteria\nWe included randomized controlled trials evaluating the effects of pharmacological and non\u2010pharmacological interventions for individuals suffering from acute high altitude illness: acute mountain sickness, high altitude pulmonary oedema or high altitude cerebral oedema. \nData collection and analysis\nTwo review authors independently assessed the eligibility of study reports, the risk of bias for each and performed the data extraction. We resolved disagreements through discussion with a third author. We assessed the quality of evidence with GRADE. \nMain results\nWe included 13 studies enrolling a total of 468 participants. We identified two ongoing studies. All studies included adults, and two studies included both teenagers and adults. The 13 studies took place in high altitude areas, mostly in the European Alps. Twelve studies included participants with acute mountain sickness, and one study included participants with high altitude pulmonary oedema. Follow\u2010up was usually less than one day. We downgraded the quality of the evidence in most cases due to risk of bias and imprecision. We report results for the main comparisons as follows. \nNon\u2010pharmacological interventions (3 studies, 124 participants) \nAll\u2010cause mortality and complete relief of AMS symptoms were not reported in the three included trials. One study in 64 participants found that a simulated descent of 193 millibars versus 20 millibars may reduce the average of symptoms to 2.5 vs 3.1 units after 12 hours of treatment (clinical score ranged from 0 to 11 \u2012 worse; reduction of 0.6 points on average with the intervention; low quality of evidence). In addition, no complications were found with use of hyperbaric chambers versus supplementary oxygen (one study; 29 participants; low\u2010quality evidence). \nPharmacological interventions (11 trials, 375 participants) \nAll\u2010cause mortality was not reported in the 11 included trials. One trial found a greater proportion of participants with complete relief of AMS symptoms after 12 and 16 hours when dexamethasone was administered in comparison with placebo (47.1% versus 0%, respectively; one study; 35 participants; low quality of evidence). Likewise, when acetazolamide was compared with placebo, the effects on symptom severity was uncertain (standardized mean difference (SMD) \u22121.15, 95% CI \u22122.56 to 0.27; 2 studies, 25 participants; low\u2010quality evidence). One trial of dexamethasone in comparison with placebo in 35 participants found a reduction in symptom severity (difference on change in the AMS score: 3.7 units reported by authors; moderate quality of evidence). The effects from two additional trials comparing gabapentin with placebo and magnesium with placebo on symptom severity at the end of treatment were uncertain. For gabapentin versus placebo: mean visual analogue scale (VAS) score of 2.92 versus 4.75, respectively; 24 participants; low quality of evidence. For magnesium versus placebo: mean scores of 9 and 10.3 units, respectively; 25 participants; low quality of evidence). The trials did not find adverse events from either treatment (low quality of evidence). One trial comparing magnesium sulphate versus placebo found that flushing was a frequent event in the magnesium sulphate arm (percentage of flushing: 75% versus 7.7%, respectively; one study; 25 participants; low quality of evidence). \nAuthors' conclusions\nThere is limited available evidence to determine the effects of non\u2010pharmacological and pharmacological interventions in treating acute high altitude illness. Low\u2010quality evidence suggests that dexamethasone and acetazolamide might reduce AMS score compared to placebo. However, the clinical benefits and harms related to these potential interventions remain unclear. Overall, the evidence is of limited practical significance in the clinical field. High\u2010quality research in this field is needed, since most trials were poorly conducted and reported. \n", "10.1002-14651858.CD013458.pub2-abstract.txt": "Background\nMigrants who have been forced to leave their home, such as refugees, asylum seekers, and internally displaced persons (IDP), are likely to experience stressors which may lead to mental health problems. The efficacy of interventions for mental health promotion, prevention, and treatment may differ in this population. \nObjectives\nWith this overview of systematic reviews, we will map the characteristics and methodological quality of existing systematic reviews and registered systematic review protocols on the promotion of mental health and prevention and treatment of common mental disorders among refugees, asylum seekers, and IDPs. The findings from this overview will be used to prioritise and inform future Cochrane reviews on the mental health of involuntary migrants. \nMethods\nWe searched Ovid MEDLINE (1945 onwards), Ovid Embase (1974 onwards), Ovid PsycINFO, ProQuest PTSDpubs, Web of Science Core Collection, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, NIHR Journals Library, CRD databases (archived), DoPHER, Epistemonikos, Health Evidence, 3ie International Initiative for Impact Evaluation, and PROSPERO, to identify systematic reviews of mental health interventions for involuntary migrants. We did not apply any restrictions on date, language, or publication status to the searches. We included systematic reviews or protocols for systematic reviews of interventions aimed at refugees, asylum seekers, and internally displaced persons. Interventions must have been aimed at mental health promotion (for example, classroom\u2010based well\u2010being interventions for children), prevention of mental health problems (for example, trauma\u2010focussed Cognitive Behavioural Therapy to prevent post\u2010traumatic stress disorder), or treatment of common mental disorders and symptoms (for example, narrative exposure therapy to treat symptoms of trauma). After screening abstracts and full\u2010text manuscripts in duplicate, we extracted data on the characteristics of the reviews, the interventions examined in reviews, and the number of primary studies included in each review. Methodological quality of the included systematic reviews was assessed using AMSTAR 2. \nMain results\nThe overview includes 23 systematic reviews and 15 registered systematic review protocols.\nOf the 23 published systematic reviews, meta\u2010analyses were conducted in eight reviews. It was more common for the search strategy or inclusion criteria of the reviews to state that studies involving refugees were eligible for inclusion (23/23), than for asylum seekers (14/23) or IDPs (7/23) to be explicitly mentioned. In most reviews, study eligiblity was either not restricted by participant age (9/23), or restricted to adults (10/23). Reviews commonly reported on studies of diagnosis or symptoms of post\u2010traumatic stress disorder or trauma (11/23) and were less likely to report on depression or anxiety (6/23). In 15 reviews the intervention of interest was focused on/ specific to psychological therapy. Across all 23 reviews, the interventions most commonly identified from primary studies were general Cognitive Behavioural Therapy, Narrative Exposure Therapy, and a range of different integrative and interpersonal therapies. Even though many reviews included studies of participants without a diagnosis of a mental health problem, they often assessed mental health treatments and did not usually distinguish between promotion, prevention, and treatment in the review aims. \nTogether the 23 systematic reviews included 336 references, of which 175 were unique primary studies. Limitations to the methodological quality of reviews most commonly related to reporting of selection criteria (21/23), absence of a protocol (19/23), reporting of study design (20/23), search strategy (22/23), and funding sources of primary studies (19/23). \nAuthors' conclusions\nGaps exist in the evidence on mental health interventions for refugees, asylum seekers, and internally displaced persons. Most reviews do not specify that internally displaced persons are included in the selection criteria, even though they make up the majority of involuntary migrants worldwide. Reviews specific to mental health promotion and prevention of common mental disorders are missing, and there is more evidence available for adults or mixed populations than for children. The literature is focused on post\u2010traumatic stress disorder and trauma\u2010related symptoms, with less attention for depression and anxiety disorders. Better quality systematic reviews and better report of review design and methods would help those who may use these reviews to inform implementation of mental health interventions. \n", "10.1002-14651858.CD003147.pub5-abstract.txt": "Background\nChest physiotherapy is widely prescribed to assist the clearance of airway secretions in people with cystic fibrosis (CF). Positive expiratory pressure (PEP) devices provide back pressure to the airways during expiration. This may improve clearance by building up gas behind mucus via collateral ventilation and by temporarily increasing functional residual capacity. The developers of the PEP technique recommend using PEP with a mask in order to avoid air leaks via the upper airways and mouth. In addition, increasing forced residual capacity (FRC) has not been demonstrated using mouthpiece PEP. Given the widespread use of PEP devices, there is a need to determine the evidence for their effect. This is an update of a previously published review. \nObjectives\nTo determine the effectiveness and acceptability of PEP devices compared to other forms of physiotherapy as a means of improving mucus clearance and other outcomes in people with CF. \nSearch methods\nWe searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Trials Register comprising of references identified from comprehensive electronic database searches and handsearches of relevant journals and abstract books of conference proceedings. The electronic database CINAHL was also searched from 1982 to 2017. \nMost recent search of the Group's CF Trials Register: 20 February 2019.\nSelection criteria\nRandomised controlled studies in which PEP was compared with any other form of physiotherapy in people with CF. This included, postural drainage and percussion (PDPV), active cycle of breathing techniques (ACBT), oscillating PEP devices, thoracic oscillating devices, bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPaP) and exercise. \nData collection and analysis\nThree authors independently applied the inclusion and exclusion criteria to publications, assessed the risk of bias of the included studies and assessed the quality of the evidence using the GRADE recommendations. \nMain results\nA total of 28 studies (involving 788 children and adults) were included in the review; 18 studies involving 296 participants were cross\u2010over in design. Data were not published in sufficient detail in most of these studies to perform any meta\u2010analysis. In 22 of the 28 studies the PEP technique was performed using a mask, in three of the studies a mouthpiece was used with nose clips and in three studies it was unclear whether a mask or mouthpiece was used. These studies compared PEP to ACBT, autogenic drainage (AD), oral oscillating PEP devices, high\u2010frequency chest wall oscillation (HFCWO) and BiPaP and exercise. \nForced expiratory volume in one second was the review's primary outcome and the most frequently reported outcome in the studies (24 studies, 716 participants). Single interventions or series of treatments that continued for up to three months demonstrated little or no difference in effect between PEP and other methods of airway clearance on this outcome (low\u2010 to moderate\u2010quality evidence). However, long\u2010term studies had equivocal or conflicting results regarding the effect on this outcome (low\u2010 to moderate\u2010quality evidence). \nA second primary outcome was the number of respiratory exacerbations. There was a lower exacerbation rate in participants using PEP compared to other techniques when used with a mask for at least one year (five studies, 232 participants; moderate\u2010 to high\u2010quality evidence). In one of the included studies which used PEP with a mouthpiece, it was reported (personal communication) that there was no difference in the number of respiratory exacerbations (66 participants, low\u2010quality evidence). \nParticipant preference was reported in 10 studies; and in all studies with an intervention period of at least one month, this was in favour of PEP. The results for the remaining outcome measures (including our third primary outcome of mucus clearance) were not examined or reported in sufficient detail to provide any high\u2010quality evidence; only very low\u2010 to moderate\u2010quality evidence was available for other outcomes. There was limited evidence reported on adverse events; these were measured in five studies, two of which found no events. In a study where infants performing either PEP or PDPV experienced some gastro\u2010oesophageal reflux , this was more severe in the PDPV group (26 infants, low\u2010quality evidence). In PEP versus oscillating PEP, adverse events were only reported in the flutter group (five participants complained of dizziness, which improved after further instructions on device use was provided) (22 participants, low\u2010quality evidence). In PEP versus HFCWO, from one long\u2010term high\u2010quality study (107 participants) there was little or no difference in terms of number of adverse events; however, those in the PEP group had fewer adverse events related to the lower airways when compared to HFCWO (high\u2010certainty evidence). \nMany studies had a risk of bias as they did not report how the randomisation sequence was either generated or concealed. Most studies reported the number of dropouts and also reported on all planned outcome measures. \nAuthors' conclusions\nThe evidence provided by this review is of variable quality, but suggests that all techniques and devices described may have a place in the clinical treatment of people with CF. \nFollowing meta\u2010analyses of the effects of PEP versus other airway clearance techniques on lung function and patient preference, this Cochrane Review demonstrated that there was high\u2010quality evidence that showed a significant reduction in pulmonary exacerbations when PEP using a mask was compared with HFCWO. It is important to note that airway clearance techniques should be individualised throughout life according to developmental stages, patient preferences, pulmonary symptoms and lung function. This also applies as conditions vary between baseline function and pulmonary exacerbations. \n", "10.1002-14651858.CD010299.pub2-abstract.txt": "Background\nCancer is a leading cause of death worldwide.\u00a0Gynaecologic cancer treatment is known to have the potential for a major impact on quality of life (QoL).
