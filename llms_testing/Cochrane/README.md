# Cochrane Folder

This folder contains various resources and notebooks used for processing and evaluating texts generated by large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3.5 and GPT-4. The main goal is to generate Plain Language Summaries (PLS) from biomedical abstracts and evaluate their performance using BERTScore. The folder structure and contents are described below.

## Folder Structure

- **BERTScore_results**: Contains JSON files with the BERTScore results for the evaluated models.
  - `results_longformer_cochrane_gpt4.json`: BERTScore results for GPT-4.
  - `results_longformer_cochrane_gpt35.json`: BERTScore results for GPT-3.5.
  
- **gpt_4**: Contains the generated texts from the GPT-4 model.
- **gpt_35**: Contains the generated texts from the GPT-3.5 model.
- **ground_truth**: Contains the ground truth texts used for evaluation.

## Notebooks

### 1. `texts_generator_with_LLMs.ipynb`

This notebook is used to generate Plain Language Summaries (PLS) using large language models like GPT-3.5 and GPT-4. It processes nearly 300 abstracts from the Cochrane library and generates PLS that are understandable by patients with varying levels of health literacy.

### 2. `texts_generated_with_LLMs_evaluation_with_BERTScore.ipynb`

This notebook evaluates the generated plain language summaries using BERTScore. It compares the generated summaries from GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 against the ground truth summaries to measure the quality and accuracy of the generated texts.

### 3. `hypothesis_test_for_texts_generated.ipynb`

This notebook performs hypothesis testing on the BERTScore metrics of the evaluated models. The tests conducted include the paired t-test and the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test to determine if there are statistically significant differences between the performance of GPT-3.5 and GPT-4.

## Conclusion

This folder provides the necessary tools and resources to generate, evaluate, and analyze Plain Language Summaries using advanced language models. By following the steps outlined in the notebooks, you can replicate the process and obtain similar results.
