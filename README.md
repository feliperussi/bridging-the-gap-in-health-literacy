# Bridging the Gap in Health Literacy - Repository

This repository aims to assess the performance of Natural Language Processing (NLP) for systematizing plain language identification and Large Language Models (LLMs), Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) 3.5 and GPT 4, for automating PLS generation from biomedical texts.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into three main directories:

### data_analysis

This folder is dedicated to the analysis of text data for readability and plain language detection. It contains cleaned datasets, results of various hypothesis tests, and notebooks for performing analysis and modeling.

### data_collection_and_processing

This folder focuses on collecting and processing the data required for the project. It includes the Data Sources folder, pfizer_and_clinicaltrials_processing, and web_scrapping.

### llms_testing

This folder contains resources and scripts for testing the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-4 and GPT-3.5 in generating plain language summaries (PLS). It includes ground truth texts, generated texts, and notebooks for evaluating the generated texts using BERTScore and other metrics.

### Disclaimer

Some code, functions, or texts were generated with the assistance of AI, including the README files, for better organization and readability. However, all content has been reviewed and modified properly by humans.
