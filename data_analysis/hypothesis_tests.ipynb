    "\n",
    "The SMOG Index is a measure of readability, and this test helps us determine if there is a significant difference in readability between the two groups. In a previous analysis, the SMOG Index was identified as having a high p-value in one of our statistical tests, suggesting it might not be significantly different between plain language and no plain language groups. To verify this result, we apply the Wilcoxon signed-rank test, a robust non-parametric test, to reassess the significance of the SMOG Index.\n",
    "\n",
    "By generating multiple random samples and performing the Wilcoxon test across these samples, we obtain a more reliable estimate of the p-value. This thorough re-evaluation helps us determine whether the SMOG Index should indeed be considered insignificant or if it plays a meaningful role in differentiating between the two groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "This analysis demonstrates that even if a feature initially appears insignificant based on one test, further investigation using different statistical methods can provide a more comprehensive understanding of its importance.\n"
