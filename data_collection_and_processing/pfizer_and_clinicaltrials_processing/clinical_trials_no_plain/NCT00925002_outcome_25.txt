Safety And Efficacy Evaluation Of Fx-1006A In Subjects With Transthyretin Amyloidosis
NIS-LL: a subscale (of 37-item NIS questionnaire) that provided a total neuropathic deficit score for the lower limbs. It assess muscle weakness, reflexes, sensation; scored separately for left, right limbs with a total possible NIS-LL score range of 0 to 88, higher score=greater impairment. Components of muscle weakness (hip and knee flexion, hip and knee extension, ankle dorsiflexors, ankle plantar flexors, toe extensors, toe flexors) scored on scale 0 (normal) to 4 (paralysis), higher score=greater weakness. Components of reflexes (quadriceps femoris, triceps surae); sensation (touch pressure, pin-prick, vibration, joint position) scored 0=normal, 1=decreased, or 2=absent. NIS-LL Muscle Weakness score range is 0 to 64, high score=more impairment. NIS-LL Sensation score range is 0 to 16, high score=more impairment. NIS-LL Reflexes score range is 0 to 8, high score=more impairment.
