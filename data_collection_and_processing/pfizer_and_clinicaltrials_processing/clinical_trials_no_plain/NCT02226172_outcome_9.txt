Single-Agent Glasdegib In Patients With Myelofibrosis Previously Treated With Ruxolitinib
Anemia response was defined as transfusion-independent participants with a ≥20 gram per liter (g/L) increase in hemoglobin (Hb) level where baseline Hb level was <100 g/L, or baseline transfusion-dependent patients becoming transfusion-independent post-baseline. Transfusion dependency before the start of study treatment was defined as transfusions of ≥6 units of packed red blood cells in the 12 weeks prior to start of study treatment, for a final pre-treatment Hb of <85 g/L. In addition, the most recent transfusion episode must have occurred in the 28 days prior to study enrollment. Response in transfusion-dependent patients required absence of any packed red blood cell transfusions during any consecutive rolling 12-week interval during the treatment phase, capped by a Hb level of ≥85 g/L.
