Avelumab in Previously Untreated Patients With Epithelial Ovarian Cancer (JAVELIN OVARIAN 100)
BICR assessed PFS: Duration from randomization until disease progression or death. PFS data was censored on the date of the last adequate tumor assessment for participants who did not have an event (progression of disease or death), who started a new anti-cancer therapy prior to an event or for participants with an event after 2 or more missing tumor assessments. Progression as per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1: as at least a 20 percent (%) increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum if that is the smallest on study). In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must have also demonstrated an absolute increase of at least 5 millimeters (mm). The appearance of one or more new lesions was also considered progression. Analysis was performed using Kaplan-Meier method.
