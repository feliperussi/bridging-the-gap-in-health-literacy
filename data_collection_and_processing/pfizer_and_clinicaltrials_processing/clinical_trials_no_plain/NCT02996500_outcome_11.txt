Safety and Efficacy of Pf-06650833 In Subjects With Rheumatoid Arthritis, With An Inadequate Response To Methotrexate
The DAS assessment is a continuous composite measure derived using differential weighting given to each component. The components of the DAS28-3 (CRP) assessment included: tender joint count with 28 joints assessed, swollen joint count with 28 joints assessed and hs-CRP. DAS28-3 (CRP) was calculated as 0.56 sqrt (DAS 28 tender joint count) + 0.28 sqrt (DAS 28 swollen joint count) + 0.36 ln(CRP [mg/L] +1)*1.10+1.15. Total score range: 0-9.4. Higher score indicated more disease activity. The criterion of DAS28-3 remission was DAS28<2.6. Tofacitinib was included in this study as an active control. The efficacy endpoint for the tofatinicib arm was an exploratory endpoint and neither primary nor secondary endpoints.
