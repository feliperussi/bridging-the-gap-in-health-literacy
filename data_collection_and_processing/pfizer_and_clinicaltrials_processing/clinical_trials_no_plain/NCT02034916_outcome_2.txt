A Phase 2, 2-Stage, 2-Cohort Study of Talazoparib (BMN 673), in Locally Advanced and/or Metastatic Breast Cancer Patients With BRCA Mutation (ABRAZO Study)
DOR: Time from first documentation of CR or PR, to PD by IRF assessment using RECIST 1.1, or to death due to any cause, whichever occurred first. CR: Disappearance of all non-nodal target and non-target lesions, with target and non-target lymph nodes reduction to <10 mm in short axis. PR: >=30% decrease in sum of diameters of target lesions, compared to the sum at baseline. PD: >=20% increase (>=5 mm absolute increase) in the sum of target lesion measurements, compared to the smallest sum on study (including baseline), or unequivocal progression of non-target lesions, evaluated as a whole, such that it is clear that treatment has failed and disease is progressing, regardless of the status of the target lesions. Participants with no PD or death at the analysis date were censored at last tumor assessment date prior to on or before initiation of a new anticancer therapy or before the data cutoff date.
