An Open-label Extension Study To Evaluate Safety Of PF-06252616 In Boys With Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy
The PUL scale was used to assess motor performance of the upper limb for individuals with DMD. The PUL scale includes 22 items; an entry item defining the starting functional level, and 21 items subdivided into 3 levels; shoulder (4 items), middle (9 items) and distal (8 items). Scoring options per item may not be uniform and may vary from 0-1 to 0-6, according to the performance, with higher values corresponding to better performance. A total maximum score of 74 is achieved by adding the individual level scores; shoulder maximum 16, middle level maximum score 34 and distal level maximum score 24.

This is the overall change from baseline which included the change since enrolling in parent study B5161002. Overall baseline was defined as the last pre-dose assessment prior to the first day of dosing in study B5161002. Week 1 was counted starting from the study treatment in study B5161002.
