13vPnC Multidose Vial Safety, Tolerability and Immunogenicity Study in Healthy Infants.
Percentage of participants achieving OPA Titer >= lower limit of quantitation (LLOQ) along with 95% CI for the 13 pneumococcal serotypes (serotypes 1, 3, 4, 5, 6A, 6B, 7F 9V, 14, 18C, 19A, 19F and 23F) are presented. The LLOQ in titers for each serotype was: Pn001, 18; Pn003, 12; Pn004, 21; Pn005, 29; Pn06A, 37; Pn06B, 43, Pn7F, 210; Pn09V, 345; Pn014, 35; Pn18C, 31; Pn19A, 18; Pn19F, 48; and Pn23F, 13. Exact 2-sided confidence interval (Clopper and Pearson) based on the observed proportion of participants. Here "n"= Number of participants with an antibody titer â‰¥ LLOQ for the given serotype.
