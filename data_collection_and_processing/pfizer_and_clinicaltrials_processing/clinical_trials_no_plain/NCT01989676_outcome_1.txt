A Study Of PF-05280014 [Trastuzumab-Pfizer] Or HerceptinÂ® [Trastuzumab-EU] Plus Paclitaxel In HER2 Positive First Line Metastatic Breast Cancer Treatment (REFLECTIONS B327-02)
One-year PFS rate was analyzed based on the time from date of randomization to first documentation of progressive disease (PD), or death due to any cause in the absence of documented PD, based on the assessments of the central radiology review in accordance with RECIST 1.1. PD was defined for target disease as at least a 20% increase in sum of diameters of target measurable lesions above the smallest sum observed (over baseline if no decrease in the sum was observed during therapy) with a minimum absolute increase of 5 mm. For non-target disease: PD was defined as unequivocal progression of pre-existing lesions and if overall tumor burden increased sufficiently to merit discontinuation of therapy; appearance of any new unequivocal malignant lesion was also considered PD. The 95% CI for the median time to event was based on the Brookmeyer and Crowley method.
