A Study Of Crizotinib Versus Chemotherapy In Previously Untreated ALK Positive East Asian Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Patients
VSAQ-ALK is a self-report measure that was developed to assess the problems of visual disturbances and symptoms may include the appearance of overlapping shadows and after images; shimmering, flashing or trailing lights; strings, streamers, or floaters; as well as hazy or blurry vision. The participants answered "Yes" to the first question (Q1) of VSAQ-ALK "Have you experienced any visual disturbances?" were considered to have experienced visual disturbance and were instructed to complete the rest of the questionnaire. The percentage of participants who responded to Q1 of VSAQ-ALK as "Yes" and as "No" during each study cycle was calculated as (n/N*)*100 where N* was the number of participants who had completed Q1.
