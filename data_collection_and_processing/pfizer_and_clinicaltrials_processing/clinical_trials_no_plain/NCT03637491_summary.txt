A Study of Avelumab, Binimetinib and Talazoparib in Patients With Locally Advanced or Metastatic RAS-mutant Solid Tumors
This Phase 1b/2 study will examine the effects of the study drugs, avelumab, binimetinib and talazoparib when given in a 2 (doublet) or 3 (triplet) drug combination, in patients with locally advanced or metastatic RAS-mutant solid tumors. The Phase 1b part of the study will assess if the different study drugs can be given together safely and which doses to use for further research. Phase 2 will test if the study treatments have an effect on tumor size and growth, and gather more information about potential side effects.
