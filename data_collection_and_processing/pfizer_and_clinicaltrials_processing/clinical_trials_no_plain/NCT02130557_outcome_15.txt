A Multicenter Phase 3, Open-Label Study of Bosutinib Versus Imatinib in Adult Patients With Newly Diagnosed Chronic Phase Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia
An AE was any untoward medical occurrence in a participant who received study drug without regard to possibility of causal relationship. AE was assessed according to severity grading based on NCI CTCAE version 4.0. Grade 1 =mild; Grade 2 =moderate; Grade 3 =severe or medically significant but not immediately life-threatening, hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization indicated; Grade 4 =life-threatening or disabling, urgent intervention indicated; Grade 5 =death. Treatment-emergent events were events between first dose of study drug and up to 60 months that were absent before treatment that worsened relative to pretreatment state. If the same participant in a given treatment had more than 1 adverse event, only the maximum CTCAE was reported.
