Study To Compare Avelumab In Combination With Standard of Care Chemoradiotherapy (SoC CRT) Versus SoC CRT for Definitive Treatment In Patients With Locally Advanced Squamous Cell Carcinoma Of The Head And Neck (JAVELIN HEAD AND NECK 100)
Participants with LA SCCHN were administered with placebo IV injection matched to avelumab on Day 1 of the Lead-in Phase (7 days) and on Days 8, 25 and 39 in CRT phase (63 days). In CRT phase participants also received SOC CRT: cisplatin mg/m^2 on Days 1, 22 and 43 + IMRT 5 days a week. CRT phase was followed by maintenance phase (12 months) in which participants received placebo IV injection every 2 weeks. All participants were followed for safety 30 days after the last study treatment administration or until the time of initiation of new systemic anticancer treatment. If any concern arose participants were followed up on Day 90 via telephone call thereafter in long term follow up period every 16 weeks for survival and new systemic anticancer treatment.
