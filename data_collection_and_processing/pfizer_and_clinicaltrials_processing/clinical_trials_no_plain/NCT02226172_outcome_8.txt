Single-Agent Glasdegib In Patients With Myelofibrosis Previously Treated With Ruxolitinib
The MPN-SAD assessed the impact of 9 myelofibrosis symptoms, at their worst, over the past 7 days and over the past 24 hours on a scale of 0 (absent) to 10 (worst imaginable). The 9 symptoms are early satiety, abdominal discomfort, inactivity, night sweats, pruritus, bone pain, pain below the ribs on the left-hand side, fatigue and shortness of breath. The TSS is the sum of the individual scores, excluding inactivity and shortness of breath. The TSS at Week 24 is the average of the daily total scores from the last 28 days of symptom scores immediately prior to Week 24. A higher score indicates worse symptoms.
