A Study Of Oral PF-02341066, A C-Met/Hepatocyte Growth Factor Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor, In Patients With Advanced Cancer
Disease control was defined as the percentage of participants with a confirmed CR, PR, or stable disease (SD) per RECIST version 1.0 (RECIST1.1 for ALK-negative NSCLC cohort 1 and ALK-negative NSCLC cohort 2). PR: At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameters of target lesions (taking as reference the baseline sum), without progression of non-target lesions and no appearance of new lesions indicated partial response. CR: Disappearance of all target and non-target lesions, normalization of tumor marker levels, and no appearance of new lesions indicated complete response. SD was defined as neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum diameters while on study.
