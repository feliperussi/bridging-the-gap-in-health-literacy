An Open-label Extension Study To Evaluate Safety Of PF-06252616 In Boys With Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy
A time to event analysis was performed for loss of ambulation. Loss of ambulation was defined as the inability to walk unassisted and without braces for at least 10 m, as assessed and reported by the investigator at each study visit, and confirmed by the inability to walk/run 10 m (as 1 component of the NSAA) evaluated at the next visit at which timed function tests were performed. This is the overall change from baseline which included the change since enrolling in the parent study B5161002.

Overall baseline was defined as the last pre-dose assessment prior to the first day of dosing in study B5161002. Week 1 was counted starting from the study treatment in study B5161002.
