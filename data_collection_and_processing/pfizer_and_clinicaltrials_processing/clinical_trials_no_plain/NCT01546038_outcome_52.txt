Treatment Emergent AEs were those with initial onset or increasing in severity after the first dose of study medication and occurred within 28 days post last dose. An serious adverse event (SAE) was any untoward medical occurrence at any dose that: resulted in death; was life threatening (immediate risk of death); required inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization; resulted in persistent or significant disability/incapacity (substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions); resulted in congenital anomaly/birth defect.
