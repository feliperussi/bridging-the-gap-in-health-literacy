An adverse events (AE) was any untoward medical occurrence (e.g., sign, symptom, illness, disease or injury) in a participant administered study drug or other protocol-imposed intervention, regardless of attribution. SAE was an AE resulting in any of the following outcomes or deemed significant for any other reason: death; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; life-threatening experience (immediate risk of dying); persistent or significant disability/incapacity; congenital anomaly. Treatment-emergent are events between first dose of study drug or the day before initiation of a new antineoplastic therapy or 30 days after the date of the last dose date of study drug, whichever occurred first, that were absent before treatment or that worsened relative to pretreatment state. AEs included both SAEs and all non-SAEs.
