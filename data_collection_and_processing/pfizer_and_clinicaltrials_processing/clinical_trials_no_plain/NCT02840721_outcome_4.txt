Safety, Efficacy, and Tolerability Study of PF-06480605 in Subjects With Moderate to Severe Ulcerative Colitis.
Endoscopic improvement at Week 14 was defined as Mayo endoscopic sub-score of 0 or 1, and without friability. The Mayo scoring system was used to assess ulcerative colitis activity, and it ranges from 0 to 12, calculated as sum of 4 sub-scores, with higher scores indicating more severe disease. The 4 sub-scores are stool frequency (0=normal number of stools; 1=1 to 2 stools more than normal; 2=3 to 4 stools more than normal; 3= 5 or more stools more than normal); rectal bleeding (0=no blood seen; 1=streaks of blood with stools less than half the time; 2=obvious blood with stool most of the time; 3=blood alone passes); findings on endoscopy (0=normal or inactive disease; 1=mild disease [erythema, decreased vascular pattern, mild friability]; 2=moderate disease [marked erythema, lack of vascular pattern, friability, erosions]; 3=severe disease [spontaneous bleeding, ulceration]); and physician's global assessment (0=normal; 1=mild disease; 2=moderate disease; 3=severe disease).
