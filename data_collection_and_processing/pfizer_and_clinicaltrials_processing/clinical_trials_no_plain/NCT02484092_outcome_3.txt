A Gene Therapy Study for Hemophilia B
An adverse event (AE) was any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation participant administered a product; the event did not need to have a causal relationship with the treatment. A serious adverse event (SAE) was any untoward medical occurrence at any dose that resulted in death; was life threatening; required inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization; resulted in persistent or significant disability/incapacity; resulted in congenital anomaly/birth defect. AEs included both SAEs and AEs. An AE was regarded as TEAE if the start date was on or after the infusion of SPK-9001 but before participant's last visit on study (or the date of withdrawal/the date of being lost to follow-up). Severe TEAEs were TEAEs that interfered significantly with participants' usual function. Treatment-related TEAEs were determined by the investigator.
