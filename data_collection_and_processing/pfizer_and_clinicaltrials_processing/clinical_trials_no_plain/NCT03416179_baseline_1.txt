A Study Evaluating Intensive Chemotherapy With or Without Glasdegib or Azacitidine With or Without Glasdegib In Patients With Previously Untreated Acute Myeloid Leukemia
Participants received first induction therapy (28 days) (backbone chemotherapy+experimental therapy). Backbone chemotherapy: Cytarabine 100 mg/m^2 daily by IV infusion for 7 days along with daunorubicin 60 mg/m^2 daily IV for 3 days. Depending upon bone marrow blast or investigator judgement participants had second induction i.e. received either same backbone therapy or cytarabine 100 mg/m^2 IV daily for 5 days and daunorubicin 60 mg/m^2 IV daily for 2 days. Participants with <5% bone marrow blasts entered into consolation phase- treated with either or both of following: 1) cytarabine 1 to 3 gram/m^2 IV for adults >=60 to <60 years twice daily on Days 1, 3, and 5 for 4 cycle (each cycle 28 day) or cytarabine per local prescribing information. 2) Received HSCT per local standard of care. Experimental Therapy: Participants were to receive Glasdegib 100 mg matching placebo tablet PO QD from Day 1 of chemotherapy up to 28 days in both induction until 2 consecutive CR MRD-negative central laboratory results, whichever came first (1.8 year).
