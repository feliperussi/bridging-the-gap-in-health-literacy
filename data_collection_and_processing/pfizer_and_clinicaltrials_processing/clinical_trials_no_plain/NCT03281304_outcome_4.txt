A Study of Tofacitinib in Patients With Ulcerative Colitis in Stable Remission
Remission as per partial mayo score was defined as partial mayo score of 2 points or lower, with no individual subscore exceeding 1 point and a rectal bleeding subscore of 0. Partial mayo score was an instrument designed to measure disease activity of UC without endoscopy. It consisted of 3 subscores: stool frequency, rectal bleeding and PGA with each subscore graded from 0 to 3 with higher scores indicating more severe disease. PGA included 3 criteria: participant's recollection of abdominal discomfort, general sense of wellbeing and other observations such as physical findings and performance status. Individual subscores were summed up to give a total partial mayo score range from 0 (normal or inactive disease) to 9 (severe disease) with higher scores indicating more severe disease.
