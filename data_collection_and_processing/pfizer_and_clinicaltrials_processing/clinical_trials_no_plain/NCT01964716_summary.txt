13vPnC Multidose Vial Safety, Tolerability and Immunogenicity Study in Healthy Infants.
This study will compare the immune responses of the infants who have been given 13vPnC in the mutidose vial formulation to the immune reponses of the infants who have been given 13vPnC in the single-dose syringe formulation.

It will also evaluate the safety of 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (13vPnC) in all infants who are vaccinated.
