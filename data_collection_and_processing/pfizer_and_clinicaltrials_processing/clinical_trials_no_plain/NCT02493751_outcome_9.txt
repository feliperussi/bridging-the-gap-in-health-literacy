A Study Of Avelumab In Combination With Axitinib In Advanced Renal Cell Cancer (JAVELIN Renal 100)
DC was defined as OR (CR or PR) or stable disease (SD) per RECIST v1.1 from the start date until the first documentation of objective disease progression or death due to any cause. SD was defined as not qualifying for CR, PR, or progression (PD). PD was defined as 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target measurable lesions above the smallest sum observed (over baseline if no decrease in the sum was observed during therapy), with a minimum absolute increase of 5 mm. CR was defined as complete disappearance of all target lesions with the exception of nodal disease. All target nodes must decrease to normal size (short axis <10 mm). PR was defined as >= 30% decrease under baseline of the sum of diameters of all target measurable lesions. The short diameter was used in the sum for target nodes, while the longest diameter was used in the sum for all other target lesions. All target lesions must have been assessed. The results reflect data available on cutoff of PCD (03 Apr 2018).
