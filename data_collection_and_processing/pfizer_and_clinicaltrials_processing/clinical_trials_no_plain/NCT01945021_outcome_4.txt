Phase II Safety and Efficacy Study of Crizotinib in East Asian Patients With ROS1 Positive, ALK Negative Advanced NSCLC
PFS was defined as the time from the date of the first dose of crizotinib to first documentation of objective PD or to death on study due to any cause, whichever occurred first. If no progression or death on study was observed, or given antitumor treatment other than study drug, participants were censored on date of last on-study tumor assessment. RECIST v1.1, PD: at least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes baseline sum if that is the smallest on study). In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm. The appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered a sign of progression. Unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions.
