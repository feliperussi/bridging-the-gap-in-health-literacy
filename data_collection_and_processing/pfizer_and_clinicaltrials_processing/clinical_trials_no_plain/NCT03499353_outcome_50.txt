Talazoparib For Neoadjuvant Treatment Of Germline BRCA1/2 Mutation Patients With Early Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2 Negative Breast Cancer
EORTC-QLQ-BR23 is a 23-item breast cancer module developed as a supplement for the EORTC-QLQ-C30 to assess the quality of life of participants with breast cancer, consisting of 2 functional scales, 3 symptoms scales, and 3 single-item scales. Each scale has 4 possible scores (1=not at all, 2=a little, 3=quite a bit, 4=very much). A linear transformation was applied to the raw scores so that all transformed scores lie between 0 to 100, with 0 being the worst and 100 being the best for functional scales, and 0 being the best and 100 being the worst for symptoms scales.

For the systemic therapy side effects scale, participants self-rated the intensity of symptoms of dry mouth, unusual taste, pain and irritation of eyes, hair loss, feeling ill or unwell, hot flushes and headaches during the past week. Negative change from baseline= improvement of these side effects, positive change = deterioration.
