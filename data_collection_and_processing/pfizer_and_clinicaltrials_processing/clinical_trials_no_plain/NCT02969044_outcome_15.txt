Study To Assess The Efficacy And Safety Of Pf-06651600 In Subjects With Rheumatoid Arthritis With An Inadequate Response To Methotrexate
PAAP: Participants assessed the severity of their arthritis pain by using a 100 mm VAS ranging from 0 (no pain) to 100 (most severe pain), which corresponded to the magnitude of their pain, where higher scores indicated more pain. PGA: Participants were asked the following question, "Considering all the ways your arthritis affects you, how are you feeling today?" and their response was recorded on a 100 mm VAS ranging from 0 (very well) to 100 (very poor), where higher scores indicated worse health condition. PGAA: Participants were assessed how their overall arthritis appears at the time of the visit. The evaluation was based on the participant's disease signs, functional capacity and physical examination, and was independent of the PAAP and PGA assessments. The physician's response was recorded using a 100 mm VAS ranging from 0 (very well) to 100 (very poor), where higher scores indicated more disease activity.
