Safety Study Of Tofacitinib Versus Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF) Inhibitor In Subjects With Rheumatoid Arthritis
All-cause death was defined as the death due to any cause during the course of study. Incidence rate was defined as the total number of participants with admissible events divided by the total (for all qualifying participants) time at risk for the cohort/treatment group of interest. Incidence rate of all-cause deaths (adjudicated by Adjudication Committee) was reported in this outcome measure. The risk period (RP) was the minimum of last contact date or last study treatment dose date + 28 days. The last contact date was the maximum of (AE start date, AE stop date, last study visit date, withdrawal date, telephone contact date). If a participant died, last contact date was the death date. First events were counted within the RP. If a participant did not have an event or had an event but outside the risk period, the participant was censored at the end of RP.
