Safety and Efficacy of Pf-06650833 In Subjects With Rheumatoid Arthritis, With An Inadequate Response To Methotrexate
The SDAI is a continuous composite measure derived from components of the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) Core Dataset.The SDAI was calculated using the following formula: SDAI = Tender / Painful Joint Count(TJC) (using 28 joints) + Swollen Joint Count (SJC) (using 28 joints) + Patient Global Assessment of Arthritis (PtGA) (0-10 cm scale) + Physician's Global Assessment of Arthritis (PhGA) (0-10 cm scale) + high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) (mg/dL). SDAI total score= 0-86. SDAI <=3.3 indicates disease remission, >3.4 to 11 = low disease activity, >11 to 26 = moderate disease activity, and >26 = high disease activity. The primary analysis utilized a Bayesian ANCOVA model with an informative placebo prior distribution with borrowing from tofacitinib historical placebo data. The confidence interval was credible interval in this statistical analysis. The efficacy endpoint for the tofatinicib arm was an exploratory endpoint and neither primary nor secondary endpoints.
