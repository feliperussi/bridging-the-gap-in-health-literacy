A 12-Month Study To Evaluate The Safety And Tolerability Of Pregabalin As Add-On Therapy In Pediatric Subjects 1 Month To 16 Years Of Age With Partial Onset Seizures And Pediatric And Adult Subjects 5 To 65 Years Of Age With Primary Generalized Tonic-Clonic Seizures
CogState brief battery consisted of 2 tasks- detection and pediatric identification task using a laptop computer with external response buttons. Prior tasks, participants were briefed rules, given an interactive demonstration and a sufficient number of practice trials. For each task, participant responded "yes" using a response button with dominant hand. Participants had to "respond as fast and as accurately as possible." Detection task: measured simple reaction time to assess psychomotor function. Participant pressed a "YES" response key as soon as they detected an event (ie, a card turning face up presented in the center of the computer screen). A participant's RCI was calculated by dividing the change from individual baseline score by ([square root 2] times WSD), where WSD is within-subject standard deviation from Cogstate detection task normative data. Improvement in cognition when RCI <=-1.65, decline in cognition when RCI =>1.65.
