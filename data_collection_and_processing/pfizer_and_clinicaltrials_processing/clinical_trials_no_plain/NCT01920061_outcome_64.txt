A Study Of PF-05212384 In Combination With Other Anti-Tumor Agents and in Combination With Cisplatin in Patients With Triple Negative Breast Cancer in an Expansion Arm (TNBC)
Percent of participants with confirmed complete response (CR), partial response (PR) or stable disease (SD) for at least 24 weeks on study according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST). Per RECIST v1.1: CR was defined as complete disappearance of all target lesions and non-target disease, with the exception of nodal disease. All nodes, both target and non-target, must decrease to normal (short axis <10 mm) and no new lesions. PR was defined as >=30% decrease under baseline of the sum of diameters of all target lesions. The short axis was used in the sum for target nodes, while the longest diameter was used in the sum for all other target lesions. No unequivocal progression of non-target disease and no new lesions. SD was defined as not qualifying for CR, PR, Progressive Disease (PD).
