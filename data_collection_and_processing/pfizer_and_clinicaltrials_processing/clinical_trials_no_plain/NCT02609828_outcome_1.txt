Phase 3 Study on the Efficacy and Safety of Tanezumab in Patients With Cancer Pain Due to Bone Metastasis Who Are Taking Background Opioid Therapy
Daily average pain intensity in the index bone metastasis cancer pain site was assessed by participants on an 11 point pain intensity NRS ranging from 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst possible pain) where higher scores signified more severity of pain. The participants recorded their daily average pain at the painful site during the past 24 hours by choosing the appropriate number from 0 to 10 on IRT diaries. Baseline daily average pain intensity value was mean of the daily average pain intensity NRS scores during the baseline assessment period prior to randomization. Baseline assessment period was up to 5 days prior to dosing. The Weeks 1, 2, 4, 6, 12, 16 and 24 daily average pain intensity value was the mean of the daily average pain intensity NRS scores recorded for each of the 7 days prior to the each specified week.
