A Phase 2 Study to Evaluate the Safety, Efficacy, Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics of PF-06252616 in Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy
The 4SC quantified the time required for a participant to ascend 4 standard steps. MMRM was used to analyze the change from baseline on 4SC for the natural history control group compared to placebo group (Sequence 3). This MMRM was established to assess the appropriateness on using the natural history control group as a comparator. The natural history control group was established by filtering the CINRG (Cooperative International Neuromuscular Research Group) natural history database. Participants who met the following requirements at baseline and had evaluable 4SC data on Week 49 were included in this group: 1) age: 6 to <16 years; 2)treatment of glucocorticoid steroids >=6 months prior to baseline and continuous use until the latest visit week; 3) 4SC: 2-15.9 seconds; 4) participants who were ambulatory at baseline; 5) LVEF: >=55% or missing.
