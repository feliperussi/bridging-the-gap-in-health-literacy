A Study Evaluating Talazoparib (BMN 673), a PARP Inhibitor, in Advanced and/or Metastatic Breast Cancer Patients With BRCA Mutation (EMBRACA Study)
DOR = time from first radiographic documentation of OR (PR or CR) till radiographic disease progression (PD) as per RECIST v1.1 by investigator assessment or to death due to any cause, whichever was first. RECIST 1.1, a) target lesion (TL): CR= disappearance of all non-nodal TL, target lymph nodes reduce to <10 mm in short axis, PR= at least 30% decrease in sum of diameters of TL, compared to the sum at baseline, PD= at least 20% increase in sum of TL measurements, compared to smallest sum on study including baseline, absolute increase in sum has to be at least 5 mm; b) for non-TL: CR= disappearance of all non-TL, PD= unequivocal progression of non-TL, such that treatment has failed, disease is progressing, regardless of status of TL; c) PD =and/or appearance of >=1 new lesions. DOR = (earliest date of progression, death, or censoring-date of first documented OR + 1)/30.4375. Analysis was performed by Kaplan-Meier method.
