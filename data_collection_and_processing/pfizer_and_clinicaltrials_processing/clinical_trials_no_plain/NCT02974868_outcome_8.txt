Study To Evaluate The Efficacy And Safety Profile Of PF-06651600 And PF-06700841 In Subjects With Alopecia Areata
SALT is a quantitative assessment of alopecia areata (AA) severity based on the scalp hair loss. The SALT score can vary from 0 to 100% with higher score indicates more severe disease. Baseline is defined as the last measurement prior to first dosing (Day 1). Percent change from baseline is defined as SALT baseline value minus SALT value at a specific visit divided by baseline and multiplying by 100. Positive change from baseline implies an improvement. Least Square Mean and 90% Confidence Interval of Arms (PF-06651600 and PF-06700841) are the Least Square Mean and 90% Confidence Interval for difference from placebo respectively.
