A Study to Evaluate Safety and Efficacy of PF-06826647 For Moderate To Severe Plaque Psoriasis
The PASI quantifies the severity of a participant's psoriasis based on both, "lesion severity" and the "percent of body surface area (BSA)" affected. PASI is a composite scoring by the investigator of degree of erythema, induration, and scaling (each scored separately) for each of 4 body regions (head and neck, upper limbs, trunk [including axillae and groin], and lower limbs [including buttocks]), with adjustment for the percent of BSA involved for each body region and for the proportion of the body region to the whole body. The PASI score can vary in increments of 0.1 and range from 0.0 to 72.0, with higher scores representing greater severity of psoriasis. PASI 100 response was defined as at least a 100 percent (%) reduction in PASI relative to Baseline.
