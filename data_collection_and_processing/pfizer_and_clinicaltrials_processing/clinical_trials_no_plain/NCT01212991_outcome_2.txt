A Safety and Efficacy Study of Oral MDV3100 in Chemotherapy-Naive Patients With Progressive Metastatic Prostate Cancer
Time to first skeletal-related event was defined as the time from randomization to the date of the first occurrence of a skeletal-related event for each patient. A skeletal-related event was defined as radiation therapy or surgery to bone for prostate cancer, pathological bone fracture, spinal cord compression, or initiation/change in antineoplastic therapy to treat bone pain from prostate cancer. Skeletal-related events were recorded at each scheduled and unscheduled study visit and during long-term follow-up if a skeletal-related event was not documented previously. Patients who did not have a skeletal-related event at the time of the analysis data cutoff were censored at the date of last assessment indicating no evidence of skeletal-related event. Patients with no postbaseline assessments were censored on the date of randomization.
