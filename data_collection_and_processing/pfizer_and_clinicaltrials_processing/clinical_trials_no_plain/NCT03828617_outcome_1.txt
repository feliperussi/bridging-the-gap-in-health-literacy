Trial to Evaluate the Safety and Immunogenicity of 3 Lots of 20-valent Pneumococcal Conjugate Vaccine in Pneumococcal Vaccine-NaÃ¯ve Adults
Systemic events fever, fatigue, headache, muscle pain, joint pain were recorded by using an electronic diary. Fever was defined as greater than or equal to (>=) 38.0 degree Celsius (C) and categorized to >=38.0 to 38.4 degree C, >38.4 to 38.9 degree C, >38.9 to 40.0 degree C and >40.0 degree C. Fatigue, headache, muscle pain and joint pain were graded as mild (did not interfere with activity), moderate (some interference with activity) and severe (prevented daily routine activity). Data for this outcome measure was planned to be analyzed for the pooled 20vPnC vaccine groups (20vPnC Lots 1, 2 and 3) and 13vPnC group.
