IBDQ is a psychometrically validated PRO instrument for measuring the disease specific quality of life in participants with IBD. The IBDQ is comprised of 32 items, which are grouped into 4 dimensions: bowel function, emotional status, systemic symptoms and social function. The 4 domains are scored as follows: Bowel symptoms: 10 to 70; Systemic symptoms: 5 to 35.; Emotional function: 12 to 84; Social function: 5 to 35. The total IBDQ score ranges from 32 to 224. For the total score and each domain, a higher score indicates better quality of life. The improvement in IBDQ bowel symptom domain was defined as an increase of â‰¥1.2 points from baseline in average score among bowel symptoms domain (items 1, 5, 9, 13, 17, 20, 22, 24, 26, 29).
