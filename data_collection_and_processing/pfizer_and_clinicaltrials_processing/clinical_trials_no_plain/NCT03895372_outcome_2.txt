A Study to Evaluate Safety and Efficacy of PF-06826647 For Moderate To Severe Plaque Psoriasis
Treatment-related adverse event (AE) was any untoward medical occurrence attributed to study drug in a participant who received study drug. Serious AE (SAE) was an AE resulting in any of the following outcomes or deemed significant for any other reason: death; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; life-threatening experience (immediate risk of dying); persistent or significant disability/incapacity; congenital anomaly. In this outcome measure, an AE was considered treatment-emergent if the event started on or after the first dosing day and time/start time but before the last dose plus the lag time. Relatedness to investigational product (PF-06826647 or placebo) was assessed by the investigator (Yes/No). Participants with multiple occurrences of an AE within a category were counted once within the category.
