JAK1 Inhibitor With Medicated Topical Therapy in Adolescents With Atopic Dermatitis
The Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy Fatigue Scale (FACIT-F) is a 13-item questionnaire. Participants scored each item on a 5-point scale: 0 (none of the time) to 4 (all of the time). Larger the participant's response to the questions (with the exception of 2 negatively stated), greater was the participant's fatigue. For all questions, except for the 2 negatively stated ones, the code was reversed and a new score was calculated as (4 minus the participant's response). The sum of all responses resulted in the FACIT-F score for a total possible score of 0 (worse score) to 52 (better score), with higher scores representing better overall health status (less fatigue). Changes from baseline at Week 12 are presented below. Changes from baseline at other scheduled time points were not evaluated.
