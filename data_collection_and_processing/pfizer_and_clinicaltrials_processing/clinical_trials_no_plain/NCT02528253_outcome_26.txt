A Phase 3 Study of Tanezumab for Chronic Low Back Pain
BPI-sf is a self-administered questionnaire developed to assess the severity of pain and pain interference on daily functions during 24 hours prior to evaluation. Severity of pain was measured based on questions 1 to 4. Question 5 (7-items) assessed level of pain interference on daily activities. Pain interference index was calculated as the mean of the seven BPI-sf pain interference items (question 5a to g), being pain interference with general activity; mood; walking ability; normal work (outside home and housework); relations with other people; sleep and enjoyment of life. Responses were given on an 11-point NRS with score ranging from 0 (does not interfere) to 10 (completely interferes), lower scores indicated less pain or pain interference.
