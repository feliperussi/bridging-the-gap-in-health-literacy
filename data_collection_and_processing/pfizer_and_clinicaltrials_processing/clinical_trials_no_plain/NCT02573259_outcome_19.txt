A Dose Escalation Study Of PF-06801591 In Melanoma, Head And Neck Cancer (SCCHN), Ovarian, Sarcoma, Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer, Urothelial Carcinoma or Other Solid Tumors
DOR was defined as the time from start date (which was the date of first documentation of PR or CR) to date of first documentation of objective progression or death. CR was defined as complete disappearance of all target lesions with the exception of nodal disease. PR was defined as greater than or equal to 30% decrease under baseline of the sum of diameters of all target measurable lesions. Objective progression was defined as 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target measurable lesions above the smallest sum observed (over baseline if no decrease in the sum was observed during therapy), with a minimum absolute increase of 5 mm. As this outcome measure was a secondary endpoint defined in the protocol to investigate preliminary signal of efficacy, the results were analyzed and are reported for Part 1 dose-escalation groups combined to provide more statistically meaningful results, instead of results analyzed by dose level with very limited number of participants in each group.
