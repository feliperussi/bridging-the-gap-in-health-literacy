A Combination Study of PF-04449913 (Glasdegib) and Azacitidine In Untreated MDS, AML and CMML Patients
Duration of CR was defined as the duration from date of first achieving CR to the date of disease progression (relapse) after CR, or death due to any cause. Participants last known to be alive who were free from disease progression or relapse after CR were censored at the date of the last assessment that verified their disease status. Duration of CR was analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method. Disease progression was defined as: percentage of bone marrow blasts increased by ≥50% to >5% (for participants with <5% blasts at screening), >10% (for participants with 5-10% blasts at screening), >20% (for participants with 11-20% blasts at screening) or >30% (for participants with 21-30% blasts at screening), and with any of the following condition: at least 50% decrease from maximum remission/response in granulocytes or platelets; reduction in hemoglobin by ≥2 g/dL; transfusion dependence.
