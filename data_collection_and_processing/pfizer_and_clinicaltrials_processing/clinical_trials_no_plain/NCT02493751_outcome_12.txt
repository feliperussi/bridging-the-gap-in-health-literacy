A Study Of Avelumab In Combination With Axitinib In Advanced Renal Cell Cancer (JAVELIN Renal 100)
TTR was defined as the time from start date to the first documentation of objective tumor response (CR or PR) that was subsequently confirmed. CR was defined as complete disappearance of all target lesions with the exception of nodal disease. All target nodes must decrease to normal size (short axis <10 mm). PR was defined as >= 30% decrease under baseline of the sum of diameters of all target measurable lesions. The short diameter was used in the sum for target nodes, while the longest diameter was used in the sum for all other target lesions. All target lesions must have been assessed. The results reflect data available on cutoff of PCD (03 Apr 2018).
