Study to Evaluate Efficacy and Safety of PF-04965842 in Subjects Aged 12 Years And Older With Moderate to Severe Atopic Dermatitis
HADS: participant rated 14-item questionnaire. HADS consisted of 2 subscales: HADS-anxiety scale (HADS-A) and HADS-depression scale (HADS-D), both of these subscales comprised of 7 items each. Each item was rated on a 4-point scale, score range from 0 to 3, where higher scores indicates more anxiety/depression symptoms. HADS-A assesses state of generalized anxiety (anxious mood, restlessness, anxious thoughts, panic attacks). HADS-D assesses state of lost interest and diminished pleasure response (lowering of hedonic tone). HADS-D: sum of all 7 items resulted in score range of 0 (no presence of depression) to 21 (severe feeling of depression); higher score indicating greater severity of depression symptoms.
