Efficacy and Safety of Tofacitinib in Subjects With Active Ankylosing Spondylitis (AS)
ASDAS(CRP) was derived using BASDAI (6-item questionnaire measures disease activity on a scale of 0 [none] to 10 [severe], higher score=more disease activity) and PGA (measure disease activity on a scale of 0 [not active] to 10 [very active], high score=more disease activity) and calculated by using the following formula, 0.121 x Back Pain (Q2 of BASDAI) + 0.058 x Duration of Morning Stiffness (Q6 of BASDAI) + 0.110 x PGA + 0.073 x Peripheral Pain/Swelling (Q3 of BASDAI) + 0.579 x Ln(high sensitivity [hs] CRP mg/Liter [L] + 1). If hsCRP values were smaller than 2 mg/L, they were set to 2 mg/L in the formula. The range of score was >= 0.636 to no defined upper limit. A negative change from baseline value indicates decrease in disease activity; a positive change from baseline value indicates increase in disease activity.
