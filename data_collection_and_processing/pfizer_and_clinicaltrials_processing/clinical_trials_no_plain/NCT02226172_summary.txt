Single-Agent Glasdegib In Patients With Myelofibrosis Previously Treated With Ruxolitinib
A lead-in cohort of ~20 patients with primary or secondary myelofibrosis previously treated with 1 or more Janus kinase inhibitors enrolled to single-agent glasdegib to evaluate safety and tolerability. Following the lead-in, a phase 2, double blind, 2-arm study, randomized 2:1 to oral single-agent glasdegib versus placebo in 201 patients resistant or intolerant to ruxolitinib.
