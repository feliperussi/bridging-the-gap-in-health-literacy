Efficacy and Safety of Tofacitinib in Subjects With Active Ankylosing Spondylitis (AS)
SF-36 v.2 (Acute): 36-item generic health status measure. It measured 8 general health domains: physical functioning, role limitations due to physical health, bodily pain, general health perceptions, vitality, social functioning, role limitations due to emotional problems, mental health. These domains were aggregated into 2 summary scores - physical component summary (PCS), mental component summary (MCS). Four domains comprised PCS score (physical functioning, role-physical, bodily pain, general health) and remaining 4 domains comprised MCS score (vitality, social functioning, role-emotional, mental health). Normalized domain scores, PCS, MCS scores are used in analyses. Component and domain scores were scored by using United States 1998 general population norm. Resulting norm-based T-scores for both the SF36 version 2 and SF36 health domain scale and component summary measures had means of 50 and standard deviations of 10. Higher PCS/MCS/domain score represent better health status.
