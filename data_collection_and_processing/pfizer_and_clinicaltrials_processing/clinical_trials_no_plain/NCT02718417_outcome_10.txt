Avelumab in Previously Untreated Patients With Epithelial Ovarian Cancer (JAVELIN OVARIAN 100)
PFS2 was defined as time (in months) from the date of randomization to the start of second subsequent treatment after first documentation of PD, or death from any cause, whichever occurred first. Progression as per RECIST version 1.1, was defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this included the baseline sum if that is the smallest on study). In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must have also demonstrated an absolute increase of at least 5 mm. The appearance of one or more new lesions was also considered progression. Analysis was performed using Kaplan-Meier method.
