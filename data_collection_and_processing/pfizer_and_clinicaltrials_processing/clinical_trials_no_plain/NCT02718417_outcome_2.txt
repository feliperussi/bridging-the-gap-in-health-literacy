Avelumab in Previously Untreated Patients With Epithelial Ovarian Cancer (JAVELIN OVARIAN 100)
Investigator assessed PFS was defined as time (in months) from date of randomization to the first documentation of disease progression or death (due to any cause), whichever occurred first. Progression as per RECIST 1.1, was defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum if that is the smallest on study). In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must have also demonstrated an absolute increase of at least 5 mm. The appearance of one or more new lesions was also considered progression. Analysis was performed using a Cox's Proportional Hazard model stratified by the randomization strata and a stratified log-rank test.
