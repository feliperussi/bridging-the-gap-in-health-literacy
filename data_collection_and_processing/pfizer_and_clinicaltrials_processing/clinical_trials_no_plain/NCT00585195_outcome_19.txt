Febrile neutropenia, defined as grade 4 neutropenia with fever greater than (>)38.5 degree Celsius, both sustained over a 24 hour period, neutropenic infection: greater than or equal to (>=)Grade 3 neutropenia with Grade >=3 infection. Grade >=3 thrombocytopenia with bleeding or grade 4 lasting >=7 days Lymphopenia was not considered a DLT unless accompanied by infection. Other non-hematologic toxicity: Grade 3 or 4 toxicities (except for alopecia, Grade 3/4 hypophosphatemia, grade 3 hypertension with controlled blood pressure [less than (<) 140/90], and Grade 3/4 hyperuricemia without signs and symptoms of gout).
