A Study To Evaluate PF-04449913 With Chemotherapy In Patients With Acute Myeloid Leukemia or Myelodysplastic Syndrome
For all MDS participants, disease specific efficacy measures included: CRi (bone marrow showing <5% myeloblasts with platelets <100,000/mcL or neutrophils <1000/mcL, including confirmed and unconfirmed responses); PR (repeat bone marrow myeloblasts showing decreased by >= 50% decrease but still >5%, peripheral blood showing neutrophils >= 1,000/mcL, platelets >= 100,000/mcL and Hgb>=11g/dL; including confirmed and unconfirmed responses); SD (including confirmed and unconfirmed responses, failure to achieve PR and no evidence of progression for >8 weeks); marrow complete response (mCR) (bone marrow showing <=5% myeloblasts and decreased by >= 50%), partial cytogenetic response (>=50% reduction of chromosomal abnormality) and complete cytogenetic response (CRc) (disappearance of chromosomal abnormality with no appearance of now ones).
