A Study Of Avelumab In Combination With Axitinib In Advanced Renal Cell Cancer (JAVELIN Renal 100)
Whole blood specimens were collected at the designated times (Day 1 of Cycles 1-4, 6, and 8, then every 12 weeks until Cycle 50, and Follow-up Day 30) to provide serum for evaluation of avelumab immunogenicity. Human serum ADA specimens were analyzed for the presence or absence of anti-avelumab antibodies with quasi-quantitative enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, following a tiered approach using screening, confirmation and titer/quantitation. ADA serum specimens were screened at tier 1. In the event that there were no positive specimens, no further analyses were to be conducted. If positive specimens were identified, these specimens were further tested with the confirmatory assay to confirm as positive. Number of participants with ADA positive at baseline, ADA never-positive, ADA ever-positive, treatment-boosted ADA, treatment-induced ADA, transient ADA response, or persistent ADA response from baseline up to 2 years. The results reflect data available on cutoff of PCD (03 Apr 2018).
