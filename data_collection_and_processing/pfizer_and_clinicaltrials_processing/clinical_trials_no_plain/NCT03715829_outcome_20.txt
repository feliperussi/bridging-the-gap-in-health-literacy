A Phase 2b Study To Evaluate The Efficacy And Safety Profile Of PF-06651600 And PF-06700841 In Active Non-segmental Vitiligo Subjects
The Vitiligo-Specific Quality of Life (VitiQoL) instrument was a reliable and validated vitiligo disease-specific health-related quality of life (HRQoL) instrument which measured concepts relevant to vitiligo participants. The VitiQoL was a 15-item PRO measure which measured concepts of symptoms, daily activities, leisure activities, work, personal relationships and treatment. Responses ranged from "not at all" (scored 0) to "most of the time" (scored 6) and gave a minimum and maximum score from 0 to 90, with higher scores representing greater burden. The VitiQoL total score was calculated as sum of items 1-15.

The change from baseline in total VitiQoL score was analyzed using the mixed-effect models repeated measures (MMRM) analysis. Baseline was defined as the last measurement prior to first dosing (Day 1).
