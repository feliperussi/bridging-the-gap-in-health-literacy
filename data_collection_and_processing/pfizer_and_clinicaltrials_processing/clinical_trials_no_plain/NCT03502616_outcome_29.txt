Efficacy and Safety of Tofacitinib in Subjects With Active Ankylosing Spondylitis (AS)
Partial remission was defined as a score of 2 or less (on a scale of 0-10, where 0=no disease activity and 10=high disease activity) in each of the 4 domains in ASAS. These 4 domains included: PGA (assess disease activity on a scale of 0 [not active] to 10 [very active], higher score=more disease activity), total back pain (on a scale of 0 [no pain] to 10 [most severe pain], higher score=more severity), Function (using BASFI which assess participant's level of ability on a scale of 0 [easy] to 10 [impossible], lower scores= better functional health) and Inflammation (using BASDAI, mean of Q 5 and 6, which assess disease activity on a scale of 0 [none] to 10 [severe], higher score=more disease activity).
