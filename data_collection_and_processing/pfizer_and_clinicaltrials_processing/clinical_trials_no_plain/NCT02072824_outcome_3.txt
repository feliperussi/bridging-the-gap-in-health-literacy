A Safety, Efficacy, and Tolerability Trial of Pregabalin as Add-On Treatment in Pediatric Subjects <4 Years of Age With Partial Onset Seizures.
Treatment-related AE was any untoward medical occurrence attributed to study drug in a participant who received study drug. An SAE was an AE resulting in any of the following outcomes or deemed significant for any other reason: death; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; life-threatening experience (immediate risk of dying); persistent or significant disability/incapacity; congenital anomaly. Treatment-emergent AEs were events which occurred between first dose of study drug and up to end of study (up to Day 25) that were absent before treatment or that worsened relative to pre-treatment state. Relatedness to drug was assessed by the investigator. AEs included both serious and non-serious adverse events.
