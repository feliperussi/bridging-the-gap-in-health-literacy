Avelumab in Previously Untreated Patients With Epithelial Ovarian Cancer (JAVELIN OVARIAN 100)
BICR assessed maintenance PFS was defined as the time from Cycle 1 Day 1 of the maintenance phase to the date of the first documentation of PD or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first. It was defined, for participants who proceeded to maintenance phase and who did not have disease progression by BICR during the chemotherapy phase. As per RECIST version 1.1, PD was defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this included the baseline sum if that is the smallest on study). In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must have also demonstrated an absolute increase of at least 5 mm. The appearance of one or more new lesions was also considered progression. Analysis was performed using Kaplan-Meier method.
