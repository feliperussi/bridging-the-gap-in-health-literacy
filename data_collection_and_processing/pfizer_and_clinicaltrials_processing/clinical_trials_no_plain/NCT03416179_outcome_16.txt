A Study Evaluating Intensive Chemotherapy With or Without Glasdegib or Azacitidine With or Without Glasdegib In Patients With Previously Untreated Acute Myeloid Leukemia
DoRi: only defined for participants who have ever achieved CRi or better (included CR and CRh) on study as the time from date of first achieving CRi or better to the date of relapse after CRi or better or death due to any cause. DoRh: participants who had ever achieved CRh or better (included CR) on study as the time from date of first achieving CRh or better to the date of disease progression, or relapse after CRh or better, or death due to any cause. CRi: not qualifying for CR, neutrophil <0.5*10^9/L or platelets <50*10^9, absence of extramedullary disease, and absence of blasts with Auer rods. CRh: MRD (positive or unknown); bone marrow blasts <5%; assessed in non-intensive chemotherapy study only, not qualifying for CR, ie, both neutrophil >=0.5*10^9/L and platelets >=50*10^9/L must be met, but does not satisfy both neutrophils >=1*10^9/L and platelets >=100*10^9/L at the same time; absence of extramedullary disease; and absence of blasts with Auer rods.
