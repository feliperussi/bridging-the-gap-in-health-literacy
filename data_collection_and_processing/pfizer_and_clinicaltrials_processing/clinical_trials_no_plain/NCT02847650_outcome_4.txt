Efficacy, Safety and Tolerability of PF-06649751 in Parkinson's Disease Patients at Early Stage of the Disease
ECG categorical summarization criteria: 1) QRS duration (time from ECG Q wave to the end of the S wave corresponding to ventricle depolarization): >=140 milliseconds (msec), >=50% increase from baseline; 2) PR interval (the interval between the start of the P wave and the start of the QRS complex, corresponding to the time between the onset of the atrial depolarization and onset of ventricular depolarization): >=300 msec, >=25% increase when baseline is > 200 msec or >=50% increase when baseline is less than or equal to (<=) 200 msec; 3) QT interval (time from ECG Q wave to the end of the T wave corresponding to electrical systole): absolute value of >=500 msec; 4) QTcF interval (QT corrected for heart rate using Fridericia's formula): absolute value of 450 to <480 msec, 480 to <500 msec, >=500 msec; an increase from baseline of 30 to <60 msec or >=60 msec.
