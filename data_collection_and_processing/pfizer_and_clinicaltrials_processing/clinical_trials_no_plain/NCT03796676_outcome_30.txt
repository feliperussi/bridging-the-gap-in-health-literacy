JAK1 Inhibitor With Medicated Topical Therapy in Adolescents With Atopic Dermatitis
The EQ-5D is a validated, standardized, generic instrument that is the most widely used preference based health related quality of life questionnaire in cost effectiveness and health technologies assessment. The EQ-5D-Y is a version of the instrument specifically developed and validated for use by youths aged 12 through 17 years. Components assess level of current health for 5 domains: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain and discomfort, anxiety and depression. Score scale for each domain ranges from 1 (minimum) to 3 (maximum), with higher scores indicating worse health condition. In addition, respondents use a vertical, graduated Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) to rate their own health between 0 (the worst) and 100 (the best health state he/she can imagine).
