DR:date of first documentation of objective tumour response(OR) confirmed to date of first documentation of PD/death due to any cause,whichever occurred first.PD per RECIST 1.1:>=20%increase in sum of longest dimensions(LD) of target lesions,reference to smallest sum of LD recorded since treatment started/appearance of 1 or more new lesions/increase of at least 5mm addition to relative increase of 20%.DR calculated only for participants with confirmed OR.Participants lacking evaluation of tumour response after date of first study drug dose was censored on date of first dose unless death occurred prior to 18 weeks.If participants had at least 1 on-study assessment,PFS was censored on date of last evaluable tumour disease assessment documenting absence of PD for participants who were alive and progression free at time of analysis/had documentation of PD/death after>=2 consecutive missed tumour assessments/given anti-tumour treatment other than study drug prior to documented PD/death.
