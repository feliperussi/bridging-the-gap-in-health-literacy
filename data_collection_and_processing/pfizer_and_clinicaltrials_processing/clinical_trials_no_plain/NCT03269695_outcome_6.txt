Efficacy, Safety and Tolerability of PF-06687234 as Add-on Therapy to Infliximab in Active UC Subjects Not in Remission.
Geboes index is a structured six-grade classification system ordered as follows: 0, structural changes (sub-grade: 0-0.3); 1, chronic inflammatory infiltrate (sub-grade: 1-1.3); 2, lamina propria neutrophils and eosinophils (sub-grade: 2A-2B.3); 3, neutrophils in epithelium (sub-grade: 3-3.3); 4, crypt destruction (sub-grade: 4-4.3); and 5, erosion and ulceration (sub-grade: 5-5.4). The final index ranges from 0 to 5.4, with low score associated with no inflammation or less inflammation and high score associated with severe inflammation or ulceration. Geboes index remission was defined as Geboes index < 3 and Grade 3 < 3.1 at week 12. Participants with missing values were handled by observed case approach (the missing data were used as is). The percentage of participants achieving Geboes index remission was calculated based on the number of participants with observed data.
