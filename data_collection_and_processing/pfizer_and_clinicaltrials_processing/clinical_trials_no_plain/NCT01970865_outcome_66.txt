A Study Of PF-06463922 An ALK/ROS1 Inhibitor In Patients With Advanced Non Small Cell Lung Cancer With Specific Molecular Alterations
The Detection Test is a measure of psychomotor function and uses a well validated simple reaction time paradigm with playing card stimuli. In this test, the on-screen instructions ask: "Has the card turned over?". A playing card is presented face down in the center of the screen. The card flips over so it is face up. As soon as the card flips over the participant must press "Yes". The participant is encouraged to work as quickly as they can and be as accurate as possible. The speed and accuracy of each response are recorded and mean of the log10 transformed reaction times for correct responses is calculated. Lower values of least square mean change from baseline indicate performance decline. Upper limit of 95% confidence interval of -0.00 or lower indicate statistically significant decline of performance over baseline at that cycle.
