A Study Of PF-06463922 An ALK/ROS1 Inhibitor In Patients With Advanced Non Small Cell Lung Cancer With Specific Molecular Alterations
The One Back Test is a measure of working memory and uses a well validated n back paradigm with playing cards. In this task, the on-screen instructions ask: "Is the previous card the same?". A playing card is presented in the center of the screen. The participant must decide whether the card is the same as the previous card. If it is the same the participant should press "Yes", and if not press "No". The participant is encouraged to work as quickly and accurately as possible. The speed and accuracy of each response are recorded, mean of the log10 transformed reaction times for correct responses is used to demonstrate speed of performance, and the arcsine transformation of the square root of the proportion of correct responses is used to demonstrate accuracy. Lower values of least square mean change from baseline indicate performance decline. Upper limit of 95% confidence interval of -0.00 or lower indicate statistically significant decline of performance over baseline at that cycle.
