Phase 3 Study on the Efficacy and Safety of Tanezumab in Patients With Cancer Pain Due to Bone Metastasis Who Are Taking Background Opioid Therapy
Daily average pain intensity in the index bone metastasis cancer pain site was assessed by participants on an 11 point pain intensity NRS ranging from 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst possible pain), where higher scores = more severity of pain. The participants recorded their daily average pain at the painful site during the past 24 hours by choosing the appropriate number from 0 to 10 on IRT diaries. The Weeks 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16 and 24 pain intensity value = mean of the daily average pain intensity NRS scores for the 7 days prior to the each week. Number of participants with cumulative reduction of >= 30, 50, 70, and 90 % in daily average pain intensity NRS score in the index bone metastasis cancer pain site from Baseline to Weeks 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16 and 24 were reported. Participants might be reported more than once in the specified rows for a time point. Rows with only non-zero data for cumulative reduction at specified time points, for at least 1 reporting arm, are reported below.
