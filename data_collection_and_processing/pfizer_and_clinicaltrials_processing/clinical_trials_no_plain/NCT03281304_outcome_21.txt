A Study of Tofacitinib in Patients With Ulcerative Colitis in Stable Remission
Laboratory abnormalities leading to study treatment discontinuation: 2 sequential neutrophil counts <750 neutrophils per cubic millimeter (mm^3); 2 sequential lymphocyte counts <500 lymphocytes/mm^3; 2 sequential hemoglobin <8.0 grams per deciliter; 2 sequential platelet counts <75000 platelets/mm^3; 2 sequential AST or ALT elevations >=3*ULN with at least one total bilirubin value >=2*ULN; 2 sequential AST or ALT elevations >=3*ULN accompanied by signs or symptoms consistent with hepatic injury; 2 sequential AST or ALT elevations >=5*ULN; 2 sequential increases in creatinine >50% and >0.5 milligrams per deciliter over A3921139 baseline; 2 sequential CK elevations >10*ULN unless the causality is known not to be medically serious (eg, exercise induced).
