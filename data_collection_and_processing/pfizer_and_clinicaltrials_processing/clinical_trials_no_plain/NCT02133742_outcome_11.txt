A Dose Finding Study To Evaluate Safety, Drug Interaction, Tumor Markers Of Axitinib In Combination With MK-3475 In Adult Patients With Previously Untreated Advanced Renal Cell Cancer
PFS: time from date of first dose of study drug to the date of first documented PD or death on study due to any cause. PD as per RECIST v1.1 defined as at least a 20% increase in sum of longest dimensions of target lesions, reference to smallest sum of longest dimensions recorded since treatment started, or appearance of 1 or more new lesions or increase of at least 5 mm in addition to relative increase of 20%. Participants lacking an evaluation of tumor response after date of first study drug dose had event time censored on date of first dose unless death occurred prior to 18 weeks. If participants had at least 1 on-study assessment, PFS data was censored on date of last evaluable tumor disease assessment documenting absence of PD for participants who were alive and progression free at the time of analysis or had documentation of PD or had death after >=2 consecutive missed tumor assessments or were given anti-tumor treatment other than study drug prior to documented PD or death.
