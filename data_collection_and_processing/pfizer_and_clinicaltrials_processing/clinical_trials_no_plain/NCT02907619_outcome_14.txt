The physical changes in pubertal development (pubic hair, penis and testes) were assessed using the system described by Marshall and Tanner. Stage 1 is preadolescent, Stages 2, 3, and 4 are initiation of puberty and Stage 5 is mature adult. Details about the system can be referred to Tanner JM. Growth at Adolescence. Blackwell Scientific Publications 1962; 2nd edition.
