Global response categorized: success, failure, indeterminate.Success:clinical response(CR) of cure(resolution of sign, symptoms attributed to Candida infection[CI]; no additional systemic/oral antifungal) or improvement (significant but incomplete resolution of signs symptoms of CI; no additional systemic antifungal) and microbiological eradication/presumed eradication(Baseline pathogen not isolated from original site culture/culture data not available for participant with successful outcome).Failure:CR of failure(no significant improvement in signs symptoms/ death due to CI)and/or microbiological failure(persistence/new infection at follow-up/relapse of infection at follow-up). Indeterminate:CR of indeterminate(evaluation not made or failure assessment)and/or microbiological response of indeterminate(Culture data not available for participant with clinical outcome of indeterminate) and neither response was failure.EOT visit:last day of study treatment (IV or oral).
