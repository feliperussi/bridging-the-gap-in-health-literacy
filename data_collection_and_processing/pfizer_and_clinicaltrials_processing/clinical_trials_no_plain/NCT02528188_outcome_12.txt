Long Term Safety and Efficacy Study of Tanezumab in Subjects With Osteoarthritis of the Hip or Knee
Change from baseline in JSW was defined as narrowing in JSW compared to baseline in participants with Kellgren-Lawrence grade 2 or 3 over the course of the study. It was measured radiographically in the index hip in participants with OA. Kellgren-Lawrence grade system was a method of classifying the severity of hip OA using five grades i.e. 0 (no radiographic features of OA), 1 (doubtful JSN and possible osteophytic lipping), 2 (definite osteophytes and possible JSN on anteroposterior weight-bearing radiograph), 3 (multiple osteophytes, definite JSN, sclerosis, possible bony deformity), 4 (large osteophytes, marked JSN, severe sclerosis and definite bony deformity). Higher grade indicating worse hip function.
