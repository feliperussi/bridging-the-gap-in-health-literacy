A Study To Find Out How Fesoterodine Works In Children Aged 6 To 17 Years With Bladder Overactivity Caused By A Neurological Condition
The grooved pegboard test was a manipulative dexterity test that assessed psychomotor speed, fine motor control, and rapid-visual motor coordination. It consisted of a small board of 25 holes with randomly positioned slots. Pegs with a key along one side must be rotated to match the hole before they can be inserted. Participants were asked to insert 25 grooved pegs into the holes within the given time limit (up to 300 seconds). In this outcome measure number of pegs placed correctly while putting in the holes were measured. The task needs to be completed once for each hand; firstly, using the dominant hand followed by the non-dominant hand.
