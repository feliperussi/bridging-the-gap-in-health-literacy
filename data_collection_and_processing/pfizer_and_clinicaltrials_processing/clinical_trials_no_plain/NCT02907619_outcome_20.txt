An Open-label Extension Study To Evaluate Safety Of PF-06252616 In Boys With Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy
Liver Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRIs) were sent to an independent central radiology imaging facility for calculation of the average R2* value which was used to monitor for iron accumulation in the liver. Mean R2* values had been used in the calculations.

Normal: R2* <= 75 Hz at 1.5 T or <=139 Hz at 3.0 T; Above Normal: R2* > 75 Hz and <= 190 Hz at 1.5 T or R2* > 139 Hz and <= 369 Hz at 3.0 T Mild overload: R2* > 190 Hz at 1.5 T or R2* > 369 Hz at 3.0 T Data from participant's Week 93 visit in Study B5161002 (parent study) were used for screening in the current study.
