Safety And Efficacy Evaluation Of Fx-1006a In Patients With V122i Or Wild-Type Transthyretin (TTR) Amyloid Cardiomyopathy
6MWT is a sub-maximal exercise test used to assess aerobic capacity and endurance. Participants were asked to walk as far as possible for 6 minutes at a pace that was comfortable to them, and were permitted to slow down, to stop, and to rest as necessary. In this outcome measure, participants on basis of change from baseline in total distance walked were categorized as worsened, unchanged or improved. If distance walked at a visit was greater than distance walked at baseline, then categorized as 'improved'. If distance walked at a visit was equal to distance walked at baseline, then categorized as 'unchanged'. If distance walked at a visit was less than distance walked at baseline, then categorized as 'worsened'.
