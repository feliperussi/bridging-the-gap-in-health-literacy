Participants with BC refractory to prior herceptin or lapatinib, Her2+ esophago gastric cancer, HNSCC, or NSCLC that were candidates to treatment with a dacomitinib-based combination. Each treatment cycle was defined as 21 days. Participants received intravenous infusion of PF-05212384 130 mg once on Day -14 and dacomitinib 30 mg orally once on Day -7. On Cycle 1 Day 1, participants received dacomitinib 30 mg orally once. On Cycle 1 Day 2, participants received treatment with dacomitinib 30 mg orally once followed by PF-05212384 130 mg once. On Day 1 for Cycles 2 and beyond, participants received dacomitinib 30 mg orally once followed by PF-05212384 130 mg once. The maximum duration of PF-05212384 treatment was 842 days and the maximum duration of dacomitinib treatment was 841 days.
