Avelumab in Previously Untreated Patients With Epithelial Ovarian Cancer (JAVELIN OVARIAN 100)
PFS by GCIG was assessed by both RECIST 1.1 and cancer antigen 125 (CA-125). It was defined as time from randomization to first documentation of disease progression (PD) or death, whichever occurred first. As per RECIST 1.1, PD: greater than or equal to (>=) 20 % increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study with absolute increase >= 5 millimeters. PD based on serum CA-125 was defined as (i) participants with elevated CA-125 pretreatment and normalization of CA-125, (ii) participants with CA-125 in the reference range before treatment; (i) and (ii) must have showed CA-125 >= 2 times the upper limit of the reference range on 2 occasions >= 1 week apart, or (iii) participants with elevated CA-125 before treatment, which never normalized, showed CA-125 >= 2 times the nadir value on 2 occasions >= 1 week apart. Censoring date for PFS by GCIG was the latest of the censoring dates for PFS by RECIST 1.1 and PFS by CA-125.
