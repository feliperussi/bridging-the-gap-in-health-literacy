A Study to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of PF-06700841 in Subjects With Active Psoriatic Arthritis
ACR 20 was calculated as a ≥20% improvement in tender and swollen joint counts and ≥20% improvement in 3 of the 5 remaining ACR core set measures: patient pain assessment (a horizontal visual analog scale assessment of the patient's level of pain), patient global assessment (the patient's overall assessment of how the arthritis was doing by a visual analog scale), physician global assessment (a horizontal visual analog scale measure of the physician's assessment of the patient's current disease activity), patient self-assessed disability (a validated and reliable patient self-assessment instrument which measured physical functions in rheumatoid arthritis patients) and an acute-phase reactant (C-reactive protein level). The participants receiving placebo in the initial period (Day 1 - Week 16) were combined into a single placebo group, while those who received PF-06700841 (10 mg QD) in the initial period were combined into a single PF-06700841 10 mg QD group.
