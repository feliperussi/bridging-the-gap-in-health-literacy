A Study to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of PF-06700841 in Subjects With Active Psoriatic Arthritis
The HAQ-DI assessed the degree of difficulty a participant experienced in 8 domains of daily living activities: dressing and grooming, arising, eating, walking, hygiene, reach, grip, and other activities. Each activity category consists of 2-3 items. For each question in the questionnaire, the level of difficulty is scored from 0 to 3 with 0 representing "no difficulty," 1 as "some difficulty," 2 as "much difficulty," and 3 as "unable to do". Any activity that requires assistance from another individual or requires the use of an assistive device adjusts to a minimum score of 2 to represent a more limited functional status. Overall score was computed as the sum of domain scores and divided by the number of domains answered. Total possible score range was 0 to 3, with a higher score indicating more difficulty in performing daily living activities. A negative change from baseline represents improvement.
