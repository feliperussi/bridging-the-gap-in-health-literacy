Study of Binimetinib + Nivolumab Plus or Minus Ipilimumab in Patients With Previously Treated Microsatellite-stable (MSS) Metastatic Colorectal Cancer With RAS Mutation
This is a multicenter, open-label, Phase 1B/2 study to evaluate the safety and assess the preliminary anti-tumor activity of binimetinib administered in combination with nivolumab or nivolumab + ipilimumab in adult patients with advanced metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) with microsatellite stable (MSS) disease and presence of a RAS mutation that have received at least one prior line of therapy and no more than 2 prior lines of therapy. The study contains a Phase 1b period to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) and schedule of binimetinib followed by a randomized Phase 2 period to assess the efficacy of the combinations.
