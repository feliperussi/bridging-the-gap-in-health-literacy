Long Term Safety and Efficacy Study of Tanezumab in Subjects With Osteoarthritis of the Hip or Knee
Any participant with incidence of an adjudicated outcome of primary osteonecrosis, rapidly progressive osteoarthritis (OA) type 1 or type 2, subchondral insufficiency fracture, or pathological fracture. Rapidly progressive OA type 1 events were those that the Adjudication Committee considered to have significant loss of joint space width (JSW) (greater than or equal to [>=] 2 millimeters [mm]) within approximately 1 year without gross structural failure. Rapidly progressive OA type 2 events were those considered to have abnormal loss/destruction of bone including limited or total collapse of at least one subchondral surface (e.g., medial femoral condyle) that is not normally present in conventional end-stage OA.
