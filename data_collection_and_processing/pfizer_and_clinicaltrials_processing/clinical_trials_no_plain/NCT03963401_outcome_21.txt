A Study to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of PF-06700841 in Subjects With Active Psoriatic Arthritis
The SF-36 version 2 (Acute version) is a 36-item generic health status measure. It measures 8 general health concepts or domains: Physical Functioning (PF), Role-Physical (RP), Bodily Pain (BP), General Health (GH), Vitality (VT), Social Functioning (SF), Role-Emotional (RE), and Mental Health (MH). These 8 domains can also be summarized as physical and mental component scores. The summary component scores, Physical Component Summary (PCS) and Mental Component Summary (MCS), are based on a normalized sum of the 8 scale scores PF, RP, BP, GH, VT, SF, RE, and MH. All domains and summary components are scored such that a higher score indicates a higher functioning or health level. The minimum and maximum scores of the PCS Score are 22 and 59 respectively. The minimum and maximum scores of the MCS Score are 11 and 62 respectively.
