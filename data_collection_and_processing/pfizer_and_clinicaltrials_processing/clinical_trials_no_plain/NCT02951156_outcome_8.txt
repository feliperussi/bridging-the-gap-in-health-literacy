Avelumab In Combination Regimens That Include An Immune Agonist, Epigenetic Modulator, CD20 Antagonist and/or Conventional Chemotherapy in Patients With Relapsed or Refractory Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma (R/R DLBCL)
Investigator assessed PFS was defined as time (in months) from date of randomization to the first documentation of disease progression or death (due to any cause), whichever occurred first. PFS data was censored on the date of the last adequate tumor assessment for participants who had no an event (PD or death), for participants who start a new anti-cancer therapy prior to an event or for participants with an event after 2 or more missing or inadequate post-baseline tumor assessment. Participants without an adequate baseline or post-baseline tumor assessment were censored on the date of randomization unless death occurred on or before the time of the second planned tumor assessment in which case the death was considered as an event.
