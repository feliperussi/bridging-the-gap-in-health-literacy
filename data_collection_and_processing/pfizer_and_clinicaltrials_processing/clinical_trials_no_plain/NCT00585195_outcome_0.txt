A Study Of Oral PF-02341066, A C-Met/Hepatocyte Growth Factor Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor, In Patients With Advanced Cancer
MTD: Dose level at which at most 1 of 6 participants experienced DLT within and including 28 days of treatment (during Cycle 1 [1 cycle=28 days]) with next higher dose having at least 2/3 or 2/6 participants experiencing a DLT. DLT was defined as any of following: Hematologic toxicities- 1) prolonged grade 4 neutropenia for >7 days. 2) Febrile neutropenia: grade 4 neutropenia with fever greater than (>) 38.5 degree Celsius, both sustained over a 24 hour period (3) neutropenic infection: greater than or equal to (>=) Grade 3 neutropenia with Grade >=3 infection. (4) Grade >=3 thrombocytopenia with bleeding/grade 4 lasting >=7 days. Other non-hematologic toxicity included: Grade 3/4 toxicities (except for alopecia, Grade 3/4 hypophosphatemia, grade 3 hypertension with controlled blood pressure [less than (<) 140/90 millimeter of mercury, and Grade 3/4 hyperuricemia without signs and symptoms of gout). Nausea, vomiting/diarrhea must persist at grade 3/4 despite maximal medical therapy.
