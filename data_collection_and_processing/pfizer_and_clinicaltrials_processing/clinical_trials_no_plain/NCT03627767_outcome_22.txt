CDLQI is a 10-item questionnaire that measures the impact of skin disease on adolescents (aged 12-17 years) quality of life over the last week. Each question was evaluated on a 4-point scale (range 0 to 3) where, 0 = not at all , 1 = only a little, 2 = quite a lot, 3 = very much, where higher scores indicated more impact on quality of life. Scores from all 10 questions were added up to give CDLQI total score range from 0 (not at all) to 30 (very much). Higher scores indicated more impact on quality of life of children.
