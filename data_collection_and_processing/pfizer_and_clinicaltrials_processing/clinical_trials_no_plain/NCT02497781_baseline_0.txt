Evaluation of Safety, Pharmacokinetics and Efficacy of Ceftazidime and Avibactam (CAZ-AVI ) Compared With Cefepime in Children From 3 Months to Less Than 18 Years of Age With Complicated Urinary Tract Infections (cUTIs)
Participants with Creatinine clearance(CrCL) >=50 milliliter per minute (mL/min) received single IV infusion of CAZ/AVI for 2 hour in following manner: 1) Age 6 to less than (<)18 years: 2000 mg CAZ/500 mg AVI (body weight >=40 kg), 50 mg/kg CAZ/12.5 mg/kg AVI (body weight <40 kg), 2) Age 6 months to <6 years: 50 mg/kg CAZ/12.5 mg/kg AVI, 3) Age 3 months to <6 months: 40 mg/kg CAZ/10 mg/kg AVI. The infusion was administered to participants every 8 hours for a minimum of 72 hours and up to a maximum duration of 14 days. Dose of CAZ-AVI was reduced to 50 percent if CrCl of participant drops below to 50mL/min, and participant was removed from study therapy, if CrCl drops below 30mL/min. After having 72 hours of IV treatment, participants had option to switch to an oral therapy at investigator's discretion.
