A Dose Finding Study To Evaluate Safety, Drug Interaction, Tumor Markers Of Axitinib In Combination With MK-3475 In Adult Patients With Previously Untreated Advanced Renal Cell Cancer
Objective response rate was defined as percentage of participants with confirmed complete response (CR) or confirmed partial response (PR), as assessed by response evaluation criteria in solid tumors (RECIST) version 1.1. Confirmed responses were those that persist on repeated imaging for at least 4 weeks after initial documentation of response. CR was defined as disappearance of all target lesions and the reduction in short axis of any pathological lymph nodes to <10 mm. PR was defined as a 30% or more decrease in the sum of longest dimensions of the target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum of longest dimensions.
