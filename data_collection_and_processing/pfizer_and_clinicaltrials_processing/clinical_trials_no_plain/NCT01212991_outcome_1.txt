A Safety and Efficacy Study of Oral MDV3100 in Chemotherapy-Naive Patients With Progressive Metastatic Prostate Cancer
Radiographic progression-free survival was defined as the time from randomization to the first objective evidence of radiographic disease progression assessed by independent central radiology review or death due to any cause within 168 days after treatment discontinuation, whichever was first. Radiographic disease progression was evaluated by CT scan or MRI and radionuclide bone scans at regularly scheduled visits. Radiographic disease progression in bone required a confirmatory scan. Radiographic disease progression in soft tissue did not require a confirmatory scan for purposes of analysis. Radiographic disease progression was evaluated by independent central radiology review using RECIST 1.1 for soft tissue disease and PCWG2 guidelines for bone disease. Patients who did not reach the endpoint were censored at their last assessment.
