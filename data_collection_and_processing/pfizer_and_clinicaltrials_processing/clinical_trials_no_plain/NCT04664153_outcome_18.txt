The investigator or designee assessed tolerability at the site of investigational product application (pre-dose and immediately post-dose). This assessment focused on the treated non-lesional skin using the scale: none = no evidence of local intolerance; mild = minimal erythema and/or oedema, slight glazed appearance; moderate = definite erythema and/or oedema with peeling and/or cracking but needs no adaptation of posology; severe (to be reported as an AE) = erythema, oedema glazing with fissures, few vesicles or papules: consider removing topical agent (if still in place); very severe (to be reported as an AE) = strong reaction spreading beyond the treated area, bullous reaction, erosions: removal of topical agent (if still in place).
