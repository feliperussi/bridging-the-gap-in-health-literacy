Safety, Efficacy, and Tolerability Study of PF-06480605 in Subjects With Moderate to Severe Ulcerative Colitis.
An adverse event (AE) was defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation participant administered a product or medical device; the event need not necessarily have a causal relationship with the treatment or usage. A serious AE (SAE) was any untoward medical occurrence at any dose that (1) resulted in death; (2) was life-threatening (immediate risk of death); (3) required inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization; (4) resulted in persistent or significant disability/incapacity (substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions); (5) resulted in congenital anomaly/birth defect. A treatment-emergent AE (TEAE) was defined as an event that emerged during treatment having been absent pre-treatment, or worsened relative to the pre-treatment state. Causality to study treatment was determined by the investigator.
