Study To Compare Avelumab In Combination With Standard of Care Chemoradiotherapy (SoC CRT) Versus SoC CRT for Definitive Treatment In Patients With Locally Advanced Squamous Cell Carcinoma Of The Head And Neck (JAVELIN HEAD AND NECK 100)
Participants with locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (LA SCCHN) were administered with avelumab 10 milligram per kilogram (mg/kg) intravenous (IV) injection on Day 1 of the Lead-in Phase (7 days) and on Days 8, 25 and 39 in CRT phase (63 days). In CRT phase participants also received SOC CRT: cisplatin 100 milligram per square meter (mg/m^2) on Days 1, 22, 43 and intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) 5 days a week. CRT phase was followed by maintenance phase (12 months) in which participants received avelumab 10 mg/kg IV injection every 2 weeks. All participants were followed for safety 30 days after the last study treatment administration or until the time of initiation of new systemic anticancer treatment. If any concern arose participants were followed up on Day 90 via telephone call thereafter in long term (LT) follow up period every 16 weeks for survival and new systemic anticancer treatment.
