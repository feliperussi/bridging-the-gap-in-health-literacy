Study To Evaluate Safety And Efficacy Of PF-06700841 In Subjects With Moderate To Severe Plaque Psoriasis
The PASI quantifies the severity of a participant's psoriasis based on both lesion severity and the percentage of body surface area (BSA) affected. In each area, the sum of the severity rating scores for erythema, induration and scaling is multiplied by the score representing the percentage of this area involved by psoriasis, multiplied by a weighting factor (head 0.1; upper limbs 0.2; trunk 0.3; lower limbs 0.4). The sum of the numbers obtained for each of the four body areas is the PASI. The PASI score can vary in increments of 0.1 units from 0.0 to 72.0, with higher scores representing increasing severity of psoriasis.
