A Study Of PF-06463922 An ALK/ROS1 Inhibitor In Patients With Advanced Non Small Cell Lung Cancer With Specific Molecular Alterations
The International Shopping List task is a measure of verbal learning and uses a well validated list learning paradigm administered using a computer. High frequencies, high imagery, concrete nouns (items from a shopping list) were read to the participant at the rate of one word every 2 seconds. Once all 12 words had been read, the participant was asked to recall as many of the words as quickly as possible. The words recalled by the participant were marked on the computer screen. When the participant could recall no more words, the same list was read again. The words recalled by the participant were recorded. This was then repeated a third time. Total number of correct responses on 3 consecutive trials at a single assessment was recorded. Lower values of least square mean change from baseline indicate performance decline. Upper limit of 95% confidence interval of -0.00 or lower indicate statistically significant decline of performance over baseline at that cycle.
