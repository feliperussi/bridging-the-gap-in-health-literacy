A Positron Emission Tomography/Computed Tomography (PET/CT) Bone Imaging Study in Patients Receiving Enzalutamide for Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer (CRPC)
Bone lesion responded: if its change from baseline in SUVtotal is below limit of agreement (LOA, no specific value, based upon test/retest analysis using software). SUVtotal: total NaF uptake,indicated tumor burden across all bone lesions/in individual lesions reflecting bone-metastatic prostate cancer.NaF-3 performed on any of these: 1) prostate-specific antigen (PSA) progression(increase of >=25% and absolute increase of >=2.0 ng/mL above nadir); 2) bone progressive disease(PD)(appearance of >=2 new lesions after screening assessed by technetium Tc 99m medronate [99mTc-MDP] bone scintigraphy); 3) soft tissue PD; 4) clinically relevant progression by investigator; 5) at 2 years without progression after treatment initiation. PD, RECIST1.1:>=20% increase in sum of diameters of target lesions,(reference smallest sum on study, included baseline sum if that is smallest on study),relative increase of 20%,sum of diameters indicated absolute increase of >=5mm, appearance of >=1 new lesions.
