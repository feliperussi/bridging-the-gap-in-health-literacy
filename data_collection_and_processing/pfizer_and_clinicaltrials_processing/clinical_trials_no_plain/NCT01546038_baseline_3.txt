A Study To Evaluate PF-04449913 With Chemotherapy In Patients With Acute Myeloid Leukemia or Myelodysplastic Syndrome
Participants received 1-2 cycles of induction (glasdegib and daunorubicin/cytarabine), followed by 2-4 cycles of consolidation (glasdegib and high dose cytarabine) and a maximum of 6 cycles of maintenance (glasdegib alone). Daunorubicin was given on Days 1-3 QD at a dose of 60 mg/m^2/day by IV together with cytarabine on Days 1-7 at a dose of 100 mg/m^2/day by continuous IV infusion for each cycle of induction. Cytarabine was given on Days 1, 3, and 5 at a dose of 1 g/m^2 administered as a 3-hour IV infusion every 12 hours (2 g/m^2/day) for each cycle of consolidation. Glasdegib tablets 100 mg QD was started on induction Cycle 1/Day -3 and administered continuously QD thereafter for the duration of the study. A cycle was defined as 28 days.
