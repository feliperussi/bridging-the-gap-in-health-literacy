Phase II Safety and Efficacy Study of Crizotinib in East Asian Patients With ROS1 Positive, ALK Negative Advanced NSCLC
The EORTC QLQ-C30 consists of 30 questions which are incorporated into 5 functional domains (physical, role, cognitive, emotional, and social); a global health status/global QOL scale; 3 symptom scales (fatigue, pain, nausea and vomiting scales); and 6 single items that assess the additional symptoms (dyspnea, appetite loss, sleep disturbance/insomnia, constipation, and diarrhea) and the perceived financial burden of treatment. All the scales and single-item scores ranged from 0 to 100, higher score is indicative of a higher response level (high score for a functional scale represents a high / healthy level of functioning; high score for the global health status / QoL represents a high QoL; a high score for a symptom scale / item represents a high level of symptomatology / problems).
