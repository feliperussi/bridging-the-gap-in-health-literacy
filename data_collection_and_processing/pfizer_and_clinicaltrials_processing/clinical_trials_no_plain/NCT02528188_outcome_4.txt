Long Term Safety and Efficacy Study of Tanezumab in Subjects With Osteoarthritis of the Hip or Knee
PGA of OA was assessed by asking a question from participants: "Considering all the ways your OA in your knee or hip (index joint) affects you, how are you doing today?" Participants responded on a scale ranging from 1-5, using Interactive Response Technology (IRT), where 1=very good (no symptom and no limitation of normal activities), 2= good (mild symptoms and no limitation of normal activities), 3= fair (moderate symptoms and limitation of some normal activities), 4= poor (severe symptoms and inability to carry out most normal activities), and 5= very poor (very severe symptoms and inability to carry out all normal activities). Higher scores indicated worsening of condition.
