Long Term Safety and Efficacy Study of Tanezumab in Subjects With Osteoarthritis of the Hip or Knee
An average daily physical activity count was measured using actigraphy which was then sorted into three intensity thresholds: light (100 - <1,500 counts) moderate (1,500 - <6,500 counts), and vigorous (>=6,500 counts). Participants continuously wore the accelerometer (apart for water activities) in the morning until going to bed at night for 7 or 14 consecutive days while going about their usual daily activities. Participants maintained a log (electronic or written) to record when the accelerometer was put on in the morning and removed at night (or if removed for any other purpose).A "bout" of moderate to vigorous activity was defined as 10 or more consecutive minutes above the moderate physical activity level threshold, with allowance for interruptions of 1 or 2 minutes below the threshold.
