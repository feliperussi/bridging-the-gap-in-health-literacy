A Study Of Crizotinib Versus Chemotherapy In Previously Untreated ALK Positive East Asian Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Patients
This is a Phase III, Randomized, Open-label, Efficacy and Safety Study of Crizotinib single agent versus Chemotherapy Regimens (Pemetrexed/Cisplatin or Pemetrexed/Carboplatin) in First-Line ALK (Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase) Positive East Asian Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Patients. The objective of the study is to demonstrate that Crizotinib is superior to first-line chemotherapy pemetrexed/cisplatin or pemetrexed/carboplatin in prolonging Progression Free Survival (PFS) in East Asian patients with advanced Non-Squamous NSCLC whose tumors harbor a translocation or inversion event involving the ALK (Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase) gene locus.
