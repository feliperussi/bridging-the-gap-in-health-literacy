A Study to Evaluate Safety and Efficacy of PF-06826647 For Moderate To Severe Plaque Psoriasis
The Psoriasis Symptom Inventory (PSI) is a self administered 8-item questionnaire that measures the severity of psoriasis symptoms over the past 24 hours and the past 7 days. The measure includes concepts of itch, pain, burning, stinging, cracking, scaling, flaking, and redness. Participants were asked to respond to each item using a 5-point Likert response scale: 0: not all severe, 1: mild, 2: moderate, 3: severe and 4: very severe. The outcome of PSI is the sum of the scores for the 8 items. The total score range of PSI is 0-32. A negative change from baseline means a better outcome and the bigger score decrease means a better outcome. The statistical analysis was for the data at Week 16.
