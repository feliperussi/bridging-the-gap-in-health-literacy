Safety And Efficacy Evaluation Of Fx-1006A In Subjects With Transthyretin Amyloidosis
This is a Phase 3, open-label study designed to obtain additional long-term safety and efficacy data for oral tafamidis (20 mg soft gelatin capsule) administered once daily (QD). In addition, this study continued to provide tafamidis to Val30Met subjects who had completed Protocol Fx-006 (a 1-year, open-label extension study to Protocol Fx-005 which was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 18-month study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of tafamidis) or non-Val30Met subjects who had completed Protocol Fx1A-201 (a Phase 2, open-label study to evaluate TTR stabilization, safety, and tolerability of tafamidis) for up to 10 years or until subjects had access to tafamidis for ATTR-PN via prescription. Upon regulatory approval for the treatment of ATTR-PN in their respective country and access to prescription tafamidis, subjects may have been withdrawn from the study. Such subjects were considered study completers.
