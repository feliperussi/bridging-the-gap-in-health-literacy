TTR was the time to confirmed or unconfirmed complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) based on investigator assessment per RECIST v1.1 by tumor type. CR was defined as complete disappearance of all target lesions with the exception of nodal disease. All target nodes must have decreased to normal size (short axis < 10 mm). All target lesions must have been assessed. PR was defined as greater than or equal to 30% decrease under baseline of the sum of diameters of all target measurable lesions. The short diameter was used in the sum for target nodes, while the longest diameter was used in the sum for all other target lesions. All target lesions must have been assessed.
