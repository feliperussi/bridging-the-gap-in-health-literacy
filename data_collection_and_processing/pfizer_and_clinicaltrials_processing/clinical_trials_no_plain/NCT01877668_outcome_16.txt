Efficacy And Safety Of Tofacitinib In Psoriatic Arthritis: Comparator Study
PASI determines psoriasis severity based on lesion severity & percentage body surface area (BSA) affected. Lesion severity is assessed for erythema, induration, & scaling, evaluated separately for head & neck, upper limbs, trunk, & lower limbs & rated for each body area according to a 5 point scale: 0=no involvement; 1=slight; 2=moderate; 3=marked; 4=very marked. BSA involvement is the extent (%) of body area affected by psoriasis & is assigned a score: 0=no involvement; 1=0-9%; 2=10-29%; 3=30-49%; 4=50-69%; 5=70-89%; 6=90-100%. In each area, sum of severity rating scores is multiplied by the score representing the percentage of area involved by psoriasis, multiplied by a weighting factor (head 0.1; upper limbs 0.2; trunk 0.3; lower limbs 0.4). The sum of numbers obtained for the 4 body areas is the PASI score & can vary in increments of 0.1 & range from 0.0 to 72.0, higher scores represent greater severity of psoriasis. PASI75 is defined as a 75% reduction from baseline in PASI.
