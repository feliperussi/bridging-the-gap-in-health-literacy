A Study Of PF-06410293 (Adalimumab-Pfizer) And Adalimumab (HumiraÂ®) In Combination With Methotrexate In Subjects With Active Rheumatoid Arthritis (REFLECTIONS B538-02).
The DAS assessment is a continuous composite measure derived using differential weighting given to each component. The components of the DAS28-4 (CRP) assessment included: tender joint count with 28 joints assessed, swollen joint count with 28 joints assessed, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) and patient's global assessment of arthritis (PGA). DAS28-4 (CRP) was calculated as 0.56 sqrt (DAS 28 tender joint count) + 0.28 sqrt (DAS 28 swollen joint count) + 0.36 ln(CRP [mg/L] +1) + 0.014 (PGA [mm]) + 0.96. Higher score indicate more disease activity. The possible lowest score is 0.96. The possible highest score is difficult to be determined, due to indeterminable nature of hs-CRP level; assuming hs-CRP level is 0 to 500 mg/L, the possible highest score would be 6.8 (when hs-CRP is 0) to 9.04 (when hs-CRP is 500 mg/L).
