Phase II Safety and Efficacy Study of Crizotinib in East Asian Patients With ROS1 Positive, ALK Negative Advanced NSCLC
Overall objective response (ORR) was defined as the number of patients with a best overall response of confirmed Complete Response or confirmed Partial Response according to RECIST v1.1 (as determined by Independent Radiology Review [IRR]), relative to the total population of response-evaluable participants. Per RECIST v1.1, CR: disappearance of all target lesions. Disappearance of all non-target lesions and normalization of tumor marker level. All lymph nodes must be non-pathological in size (<10 mm short axis); PR: at least 30% decrease in sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference baseline sum diameters. Confirmed responses were those that persisted on repeat imaging at least 4 weeks after the initial documentation of response.
