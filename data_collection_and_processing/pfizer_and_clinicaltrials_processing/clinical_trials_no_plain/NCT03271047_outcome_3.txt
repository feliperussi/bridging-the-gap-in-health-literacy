Study of Binimetinib + Nivolumab Plus or Minus Ipilimumab in Patients With Previously Treated Microsatellite-stable (MSS) Metastatic Colorectal Cancer With RAS Mutation
DOR was defined as the time between the date of the first documented confirmed response (PR or CR) and the date of the first documented progression or death due to any cause. As per RECIST v1.1: CR was defined as disappearance of target and non-target lesions and normalization of tumor markers. Pathological lymph nodes short axis measures <10 mm. PR was defined as at least 30% decrease in sum of measures (tumor lesions- longest diameter and nodes- short axis) of target lesions, taking as reference baseline sum of diameters. PD was defined as at least 20% increase in sum of diameters of measured lesions taking as references smallest sum of diameters recorded on study (including baseline) and an absolute increase of >=5 mm or appearance of at least 1 new lesion. Unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions.
