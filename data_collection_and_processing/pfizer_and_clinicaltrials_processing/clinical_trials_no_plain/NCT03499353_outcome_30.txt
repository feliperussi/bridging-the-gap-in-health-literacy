Talazoparib For Neoadjuvant Treatment Of Germline BRCA1/2 Mutation Patients With Early Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2 Negative Breast Cancer
EORTC QLQ-C30 is a 30-item cancer-specific instrument that assesses participant reported outcomes, with 5 functional scales, 3 symptoms scales, a GHS/QoL scale, and 6 single-item scales. The GHS/QoL scale has 7 possible scores (1=very poor to 7=excellent); other items have 4 possible scores (1=not at all to 4=very much).

For the nausea and vomiting symptoms scale, participants self-rated how much they had felt nauseated and/or vomited during the past week. A linear transformation was applied to raw scores so that transformed scores lie between 0 to 100, with 0 being the best and 100 being the worst for this symptom scale. A 10 point change from baseline was used to indicate clinically meaningful change. Definitive deterioration was defined asâ‰¥10 point increase from baseline without any subsequent <10 point increase. Probability of not achieving definitive deterioration (being event-free) at specified time points (3 and 6 months post-baseline) using Kaplan Meier method were reported.
