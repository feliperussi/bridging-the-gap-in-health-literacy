Efficacy and Safety of a Subcutaneous Tanezumab Titration Dosing Regimen in Subjects With Moderate to Severe Osteoarthritis of the Hip or Knee
EQ-5D-5L is a standardized participant completed questionnaire that measures health-related quality of life and translates that score into an index value or utility score. EQ-5D-5L consists of two components: a health state profile and an optional visual analogue scale (VAS). EQ-5D health state profile is comprised of 5 dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. Each dimension has 5 levels: 1=no problems, 2=slight problems, 3=moderate problems, 4=severe problems, and 5=extreme problems. The health utility score for a patient with no problems in all 5 items is 1 for all countries (except for Zimbabwe where it is 0.9), and is reduced where a patient reports greater levels of problems across the five dimensions.
