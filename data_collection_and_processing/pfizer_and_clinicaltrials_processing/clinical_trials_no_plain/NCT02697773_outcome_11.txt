WOMAC: self-administered, disease-specific questionnaire which assesses clinically important, participant-relevant symptoms for pain, stiffness and physical function in participants with OA. The WOMAC pain subscale is a 5-item questionnaire used to assess the amount of pain experienced due to osteoarthritis of index joint during past 48 hours. It was calculated as the mean of scores from 5 individual questions scored on a NRS of 0 (no pain) to 10 (extreme pain), where higher scores indicated higher pain. Total score range for WOMAC pain subscale score was 0 (no pain) to 10 (extreme pain), where higher scores indicated higher pain. Percentage of participants with cumulative reduction (as percent) (greater than 0% ; >= 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80 and 90%; = 100 %) in WOMAC pain subscale from Baseline to Week 16 were reported, participants (%) are reported more than once in categories specified.
