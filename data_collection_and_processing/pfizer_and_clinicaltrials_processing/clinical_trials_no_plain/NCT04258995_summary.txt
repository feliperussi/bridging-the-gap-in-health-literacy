A TRIAL TO EVALUATE THE SAFETY, TOLERABILITY, AND IMMUNOGENICITY OF A BOOSTER DOSE OF A GROUP B STREPTOCOCCUS 6 VALENT POLYSACCHARIDE CONJUGATE VACCINE (GBS6) IN HEALTHY ADULTS
This study is an extension to the completed first-in-human C1091001 study (NCT03170609) and is to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of a single booster vaccine dose of GBS6, administered approximately 2 years or more after a primary GBS6 dose, to healthy adult males and nonpregnant women. The study will determine whether individuals who received a primary dose of GBS6 have additional benefit following a booster dose.
