Safety Study Of Tofacitinib Versus Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF) Inhibitor In Subjects With Rheumatoid Arthritis
Clinically significant laboratory abnormalities: Hematology: hemoglobin, hematocrit, erythrocytes with primary criteria as less than [<] 0.8* lower limit of normal [LLN]), platelets (<0.5* LLN; >1.75* ULN), leukocytes (<0.6*LLN; >1.5*ULN), lymphocytes, lymphocytes/leukocytes, neutrophils, neutrophils/leukocytes (<0.8*LLN; >1.2*ULN), eosinophils, eosinophils/leukocytes, monocytes, monocytes/leukocytes (>1.2*ULN); urinalysis: urine glucose, urine protein, urine hemoglobin, and leukocyte esterase (>=1); chemistry: bilirubin, indirect bilirubin (>1.5*ULN) aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase (>3.0*ULN), creatinine, triglycerides, cholesterol (>1.3*ULN) and HDL cholesterol (<0.8*LLN). Risk period (RP) was minimum of last contact date or last study treatment dose date+28 days. Last contact date was (date of death or maximum of dates: AE start, AE stop, last study visit, withdrawal, telephone contact). Participants without event or event outside RP were censored at end of RP.
