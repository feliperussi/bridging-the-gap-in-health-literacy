A Study To Evaluate Safety And Efficacy Of IV Sildenafil In The Treatment Of Neonates With Persistent Pulmonary Hypertension Of The Newborn
The Bayley-III assesses infant and toddler development across five domains: cognitive, language, motor, social-emotional (SE), and adaptive behavior (AB). Assessments of the cognitive, language, and motor domains conducted using items administered to the child; assessments of the SE and AB domains conducted using the primary caregiver's responses to a questionnaire. The questionnaire comprises the SE scale (35 items) and the AB scale (241 items). Raw scores of SE and AB were converted to composite scores. Composite scores for SE and AB scale ranged from 40 to 160, where higher scores indicated better social-emotional skills and adaptive behavior in child. In this outcome measure composite scores for parent/caregiver were reported at month 24.
