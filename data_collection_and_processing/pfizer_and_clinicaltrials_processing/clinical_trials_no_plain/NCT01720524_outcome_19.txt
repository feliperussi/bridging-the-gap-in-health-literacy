A Study To Evaluate Safety And Efficacy Of IV Sildenafil In The Treatment Of Neonates With Persistent Pulmonary Hypertension Of The Newborn
Standard age-appropriate ophthalmological examinations were used to assess visual acuity (performed differently for children able of verbal interaction) at month 12 and 24. Visual acuity (VA) of verbal children was assessed for each eye using the Snellen method, where logarithm of minimum angle of resolution (logMAR) units were derived from the Snellen ratios. Participants had to read letters from the chart at a distance of 20 feet/6 meter or 4 meter. VA (Snellen ratio) = distance between the chart and participant, divided by distance at which participant was able to see/read chart without impairment; expressed as decimal, logMAR = log10 (1/decimal VA). In this outcome measure, data have been reported for right and left eye separately.
