A Study To Evaluate PF-04449913 With Chemotherapy In Patients With Acute Myeloid Leukemia or Myelodysplastic Syndrome
A DLT was any of the following adverse events (AEs) in Cycle 1 and considered by the investigator possibly related to glasdegib in combination with chemotherapy: (1) Grade >= 3 non-hematologic toxicity, excluding Grade >= 3 infection, fever (including febrile neutropenia), infusion related AEs, electrolyte abnormalities and ALT/AST elevation that returned to Grade <= 1 or baseline within 7 days; (2) prolonged myelosuppression that lasted longer than 42 days from the point of detection, defined as absolute neutrophil count (ANC) < 500/microliter(mcL) or platelet count < 10 *10^9/L with a normal bone marrow (<5% blasts and no evidence of disease or dysplasia); (3) inability to deliver at least 80% of the planned study doses for all agents in a combination due to non-hematologic toxicities; (4) Delay of >28 days in receiving the next scheduled cycle due to persisting non-hematologic toxicities. Arm A: Glasdegib+LDAC; Arm B: Glasdegib+Decitabine; Arm C: Glasdegib+Cytarabine/Daunorubicin.
