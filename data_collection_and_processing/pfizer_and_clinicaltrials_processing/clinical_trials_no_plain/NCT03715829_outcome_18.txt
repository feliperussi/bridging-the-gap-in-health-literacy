A Phase 2b Study To Evaluate The Efficacy And Safety Profile Of PF-06651600 And PF-06700841 In Active Non-segmental Vitiligo Subjects
The site assessment of the F-VASI was calculated using a formula that included contribution from face (possible range, 0-4): Local F-VASI = [Digit Units] × [Depigmentation] × 0.1. Scalp, neck, eyebrows, eyelashes, and vermilion were excluded from this calculation. The volar surface of 1 digit (the participant's thumb) was approximately 0.1% of the total body surface area and was used as a guide to estimate the baseline percentage of vitiligo involvement of face. The extent of depigmentation was expressed by the following percentages: 0, 10%, 25%, 50%, 75%, 90%, or 100%. Percent change from baseline in Local F-VASI = ((post baseline Local F-VASI - baseline Local F-VASI)/baseline Local F-VASI)×100. This outcome measure was the percentage of participants achieving at least 90% improvement in site assessment F-VASI from baseline (F-VASI90). Negative percent change from baseline in F-VASI signified an improvement. Baseline was defined as the last measurement prior to first dosing (Day 1).
