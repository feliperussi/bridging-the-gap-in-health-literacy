A Study of Crisaborole Ointment 2%; Crisaborole Vehicle; TCS and TCI in Subjects Aged â‰¥ 2 Years, With Mild-moderate AD
The DFI was a 10-item disease questionnaire that measures the impact of having a child (aged 2-17 years) with AD on family quality of life. It was completed by parent/legal guardian of the child (affected by AD), based on recall over the past week. Each question was scored on a 4-point scale ranging from 0 (not at all) to 30 (very much): where higher scores indicated worst quality of life of family. The DFI total score was the sum of individual scores of the 10 questions and ranged from 0 (no impact on life of family) to 30 (maximum effect on life of family), where higher DFI scores indicated maximum effect on life of family.
