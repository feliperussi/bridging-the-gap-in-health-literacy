A Study Of PF-05280014 [Trastuzumab-Pfizer] Or HerceptinÂ® [Trastuzumab-EU] Plus Paclitaxel In HER2 Positive First Line Metastatic Breast Cancer Treatment (REFLECTIONS B327-02)
Participants with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive breast cancer received PF-05280014 on Days 1, 8, 15 and 22 of each 28-day cycle followed by paclitaxel on Days 1, 8 and 15 of each 28-day cycle both as intravenous (IV) infusions until the end of the study. The first infusion of PF-05280014 was 4 mg/kg over 90 minutes on Cycle 1 Day 1. Subsequent weekly infusions of PF-05280014 were 2 mg/kg over 30 to 90 minutes. Paclitaxel was administered at a dose of 80 mg/m^2 over 60 minutes. Following completion of the paclitaxel administration period and beginning no earlier than Week 33 of the study, the PF-05280014 could be changed at the discretion of the investigator to every 3 weeks at a dose of 6 mg/kg infused over 30 to 90 minutes depending on tolerability.
