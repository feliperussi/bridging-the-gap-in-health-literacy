A Study Of PF-05280014 [Trastuzumab-Pfizer] Or HerceptinÂ® [Trastuzumab-EU] Plus Paclitaxel In HER2 Positive First Line Metastatic Breast Cancer Treatment (REFLECTIONS B327-02)
The current study will compare the efficacy, safety, pharmacokinetics and immunogenicity of PF-05280014 in combination with paclitaxel versus trastuzumab sourced from the European Union (trastuzumab-EU) with paclitaxel in female patients with HER2-positive, metastatic breast cancer in the first-line treatment setting. The hypothesis to be tested in this study is that the efficacy (ORR) of PF-05280014 is similar to trastuzumab-EU.
