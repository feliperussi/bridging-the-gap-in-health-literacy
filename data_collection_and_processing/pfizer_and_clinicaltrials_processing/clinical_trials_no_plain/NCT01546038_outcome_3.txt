A Study To Evaluate PF-04449913 With Chemotherapy In Patients With Acute Myeloid Leukemia or Myelodysplastic Syndrome
OS was defined as duration from the date of randomization to the date of death from any cause. Kaplan-Meier (KM) method was used to estimate median OS. In this method, every participant had a follow-up time which was associated with an indicator, 1=event (death in our case), and 0 =censored. If the participants were not known to have died, time to date of last known to be alive was used as to calculate the follow-up time and indicator was 0 for these participants. KM method estimates the median OS based on the K-M curve. The K-M curve only drops when we had an event and censor data are the ticks in the graph. To estimate median OS, the K-M curve usually will be smoothed first and a line will be drawn at 50%. The median OS is the point when K-M curve and the horizontal hit. Survival status was collected every month for the first 2 months after discontinuation of study treatment and thereafter every 2 months until death or 4 years from each participant's first dose.
