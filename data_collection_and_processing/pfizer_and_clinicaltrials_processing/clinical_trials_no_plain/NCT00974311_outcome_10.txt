Safety and Efficacy Study of MDV3100 in Patients With Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer Who Have Been Previously Treated With Docetaxel-based Chemotherapy
AE: any untoward medical occurrence in a participant who received study drug without regard to possibility of causal relationship. SAE: AE resulting in any of following outcomes or deemed significant and jeopardized participants or required treatment to prevent other AE outcomes for any other reason: death; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; life-threatening experience (immediate risk of dying); persistent or significant disability/incapacity; congenital anomaly. TEAEs were events which occurred between first dose of study drug and up to the safety follow-up visit or the initiation of another anti-neoplastic therapy, whichever occurred first (up to 101 months). AEs included both serious and non-serious AEs. Clinically significant physical examination abnormalities were reported as AEs. Unscheduled visit was performed at any time during the study whenever necessary to assess for or follow-up on AEs, at the participant's request or if deemed necessary by the investigator.
