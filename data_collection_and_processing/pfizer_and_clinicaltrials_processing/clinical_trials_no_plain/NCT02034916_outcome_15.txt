A Phase 2, 2-Stage, 2-Cohort Study of Talazoparib (BMN 673), in Locally Advanced and/or Metastatic Breast Cancer Patients With BRCA Mutation (ABRAZO Study)
Time to deterioration was defined as the time from baseline to day to death, first occurrence of progression, or a >=10 point change from baseline in any of the symptom score based on the EORTC-QLQ-BR23, whichever occurred first. EORTC-QLQ-BR23 is a disease-specific module for breast cancer developed as a supplement for the EORTC-QLQ-C30 to assess the quality of life of participants with breast cancer. EORTC-QLQ-BR23 symptoms subscale includes 4 items: systemic therapy side effects, breast symptoms, arm symptoms, upset by hair loss. Each item is rated by choosing 1 of 4 possible responses that record the level of intensity (1= not at all, 2= a little, 3= quite a bit, and 4= very much) within each scale.
