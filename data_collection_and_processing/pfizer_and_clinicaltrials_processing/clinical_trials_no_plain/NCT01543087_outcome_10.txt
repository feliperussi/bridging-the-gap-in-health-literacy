Duration of hSBA Response After a Primary Series of Bivalent rLP2086 Followed by a Booster Dose
For immunogenicity assessment, hSBA was performed with 4 primary MnB test strains. Percentage of participants achieving hSBA titer >= LLOQ were computed along with corresponding 2-sided 95 % CIs. LLOQ was 1:16 for PMB80 (A22) and 1:8 for PMB2001 (A56), PMB2948 (B24) and PMB2707 (B44). Participants of Group 3c (participants from primary study B1971015) were not continued in booster stage. only participants who received bivalent rLP2086 in primary study B1971010 were not analysed for this endpoint. Only participants who received bivalent rLP2086 in primary study B1971012 on a 0-, 2-, and 6-month or a 0- and 6-month vaccination schedule were eligible to be followed for 26 months after booster vaccination
