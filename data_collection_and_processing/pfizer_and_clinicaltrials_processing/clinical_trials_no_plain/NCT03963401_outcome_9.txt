A Study to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of PF-06700841 in Subjects With Active Psoriatic Arthritis
The blinded assessor assessed the participant's overall arthritis appears at the time of each visit. This was an evaluation based on the participant's disease signs, functional capacity and physical examination, and was independent of the Patient's Global Assessment of Arthritis. The investigator's response was recorded using a 100 mm visual analog scale (VAS) by placing a mark on the scale between 0 (very good) and 100 (very poor). VAS data was rescaled prior to any calculation and analysis. Rescaled VAS score (mm) = (100 mm) Ã— (length at mark in mm/overall length of line in mm). The score range was 0 mm to 100 mm, and a negative change from baseline represents improvement.
