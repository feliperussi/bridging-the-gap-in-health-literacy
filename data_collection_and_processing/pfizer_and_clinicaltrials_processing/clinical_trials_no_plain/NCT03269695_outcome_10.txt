Efficacy, Safety and Tolerability of PF-06687234 as Add-on Therapy to Infliximab in Active UC Subjects Not in Remission.
The Mayo score is determined by the summation of 4 subscores (Endoscopic, stool frequency, rectal bleeding and Physician's global assessment [PGA]), each graded 0 (normal) to 3 (worst). Derived partial mayo score is defined as total Mayo score excluding the endoscopic subscore (stool frequency, rectal bleeding and PGA only), ranging from 0 (normal) to 9 (the most severe). The percentages of participants with change from baseline in derived partial Mayo score of <=2 with no individual subscore >1 at Weeks 2, 4, 8 and 12 were calculated for this endpoint. Participants with missing values were handled by observed case approach (the missing data were used as is). Generalized Linear Mixed Model (GLMM) was used with fixed effects of treatment, visit and treatment by visit interaction.
