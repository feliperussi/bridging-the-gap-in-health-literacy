PF-06741086 Multiple Dose Study in Severe Hemophilia
Pre-treatment ABR = number of bleeding episodes within 6 months prior to study enrollment (total number of bleeding episodes in hemophilia history CRF) Ã— 2; On-study ABR = number of bleeding episodes occurred within 9 days after the last dose / ([last dose date + 9 - first dose date + 1] / 365.25) The historical On Demand group was constructed using the following internal Pfizer studies: ReFacto AF 3082B2-4432 (B1831004), BeneFIX B1821010, and BeneFIX 3090A1-400 (B1821004). Participants who were on On Demand treatment in B1831004, as well as data from the On Demand period in B1821004 and B1821010 were used to construct the historical On Demand group. The resulting dataset were further filtered to match the key inclusion/exclusion criteria of Study B7841002 based on age and factor activity (18 <=age <=65 and factor activity <=1%).
