Avelumab in Previously Untreated Patients With Epithelial Ovarian Cancer (JAVELIN OVARIAN 100)
National Comprehensive Cancer Network-Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy (NCCN-FACT) Ovarian Symptom Index-18 (FOSI-18) is an 18-itemed participant completed questionnaire, designed to assess impact of cancer therapy on ovarian cancer-related symptoms. Based on numerical point scoring of symptoms. Includes three subscales: disease-related symptoms (10 items), treatment-related side effects (5) and general function/well-being (3). Participants rated their level of symptoms for each items using 5-point scale from 0=not at all to 4=very much. Items that were negatively framed, scores were reversed for analysis so that higher scores= good quality of life. Total symptom index: total of 18 scores, ranging from 0=severely symptomatic to 72=asymptomatic. Higher FOSI-18 scores= better functioning or lower symptom burden. MP applicable only for arms 'Chemotherapy followed by Avelumab' and 'Chemotherapy + Avelumab followed by Avelumab' and OP for 'Chemotherapy followed by Observation'.
