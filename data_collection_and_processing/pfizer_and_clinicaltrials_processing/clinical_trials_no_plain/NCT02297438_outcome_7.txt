A Study Of Palbociclib (PD-0332991) + Letrozole VS. Placebo+ Letrozole For 1st Line Treatment Of Asian Postmenopausal Women With ER+/HER2- Advanced Breast Cancer [PALOMA-4]
DOR was defined as the time from the first documentation of objective tumor response (complete response [CR] or partial response [PR]) to the first documentation of objective tumor progression or to death due to any cause, whichever occurred first. DOR data was censored on the date of the last tumor assessment on study for participants who did not have objective tumor progression and who did not die due to any cause while on study. CR was defined as complete disappearance of all target lesions with the exception of nodal disease. All target nodes must decrease to normal size (short axis <10 mm). No new lesions. The PR was defined as greater than or equal to 30% decrease under baseline of the sum of diameters of all target measurable lesions. The short diameter was used in the sum for target nodes, while the longest diameter was used in the sum for all other target lesions. No new lesions. In this outcome measure, DOR was based on BICR.
