Study of Binimetinib + Nivolumab Plus or Minus Ipilimumab in Patients With Previously Treated Microsatellite-stable (MSS) Metastatic Colorectal Cancer With RAS Mutation
ORR was defined as the percentage of participants who achieved a BOR of CR or PR as determined by investigator per RECIST v1.1. As per RECIST v1.1, CR was defined as disappearance of target and non-target lesions and normalization of tumor markers. Pathological lymph nodes must have short axis measures <10 mm. PR was defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of measures (longest diameter for tumor lesions and short axis measure for nodes) of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum of diameters. Non-target lesions must be non-PD. PD was defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study. In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm. The appearance of one or more new lesions was also considered progression.
