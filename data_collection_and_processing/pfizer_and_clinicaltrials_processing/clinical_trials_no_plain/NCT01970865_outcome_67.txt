A Study Of PF-06463922 An ALK/ROS1 Inhibitor In Patients With Advanced Non Small Cell Lung Cancer With Specific Molecular Alterations
The Identification Test is a measure of visual attention and uses a well validated choice reaction time paradigm with playing card stimuli. In this task, the playing cards are all red or black jokers. The on-screen instructions ask: "Is the card red?". A playing card is presented face down in the center of the screen. The card flips over so it is face up. As soon as it flips over the participant must decide whether the card is red or not. If it is red the participant should press "Yes", and if it is not red the participant should press "No". The participant is encouraged to work as quickly and accurately as possible. The speed and accuracy of each response are recorded and mean of the log10 transformed reaction times for correct responses is calculated. Lower values of least square mean change from baseline indicate performance decline. Upper limit of 95% confidence interval of -0.00 or lower indicate statistically significant decline of performance over baseline at that cycle.
