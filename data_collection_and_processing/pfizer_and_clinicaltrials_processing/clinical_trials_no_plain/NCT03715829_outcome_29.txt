A Phase 2b Study To Evaluate The Efficacy And Safety Profile Of PF-06651600 And PF-06700841 In Active Non-segmental Vitiligo Subjects
AE was defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a study participant administered a product or medical device; the event did not necessarily need to have a causal relationship with the treatment or usage. An AE was considered a TEAE if the event started during the effective duration of treatment. All events that started on or after the first dosing day and time/start time, if collected, but before the last dose plus the lag time were flagged as TEAEs. SAE was defined as any untoward medical occurrence at any dose that resulted in death; was life threatening (immediate risk of death); requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization; resulted in persistent or significant disability/incapacity (substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions); resulted in congenital anomaly/birth defect; or that was considered to be an important medical event. Causality to study treatment was determined by the investigator.
