Study of Binimetinib + Nivolumab Plus or Minus Ipilimumab in Patients With Previously Treated Microsatellite-stable (MSS) Metastatic Colorectal Cancer With RAS Mutation
Participants with previously treated MSS metastatic colorectal cancer with RAS mutation received binimetinib at a starting dose of 45 mg tablet BID along with 480 mg IV dose of nivolumab every 4 weeks in each 28 day treatment cycle. Ipilimumab was administered at the dose of 1 mg/kg IV every 8 weeks after completion of nivolumab infusion. Binimetinib dose modification to intermitted dosing (3 weeks on treatment and 1 week off treatment) with 45 mg dose or dose reduction to 30 mg BID or 30 mg intermittent dosing based on investigator's decision as per its tolerability among participants. Participants then followed up for safety for around 150 days.
