A Phase 2 Study to Evaluate the Safety, Efficacy, Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics of PF-06252616 in Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy
The NSAA is a 17-item test that measured gross motor function. Each individual item received a score of 0-unable to perform independently, 1-able to perform with assistance, or 2-able to perform without assistance. A total score was achieved by summing all the individual items. The total score could range from 0 to 34 (fully-independent function). A subset analysis was performed by categorizing participants into 3 subsets according to the baseline 4SC time: 1) <3.5 seconds, 2)>=3.5 seconds and <=8 seconds, 3) >8 seconds. MMRM was used to analyze the change from baseline for domagrozumab compared to placebo in subsets. The stratification factor, baseline result, treatment, time and treatment by time interaction were included as fixed effects in the model. Participants were included as a random effect and the model was fit with an unstructured covariance for the repeated measures.
