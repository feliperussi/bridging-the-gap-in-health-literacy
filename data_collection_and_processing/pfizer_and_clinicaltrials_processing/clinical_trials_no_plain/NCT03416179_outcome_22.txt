A Study Evaluating Intensive Chemotherapy With or Without Glasdegib or Azacitidine With or Without Glasdegib In Patients With Previously Untreated Acute Myeloid Leukemia
EQ-5D-5L: brief, self-administered, validated and reliable generic health status instrument developed by the EuroQoL Group. It consists of the EQ-5D descriptive system and a visual analogue scale (VAS), the EuroQoL visual analogue scale (EQ-VAS). EQ-5D: descriptive system measures a participant's health state on 5 dimensions (mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression). Participant is asked to indicate his/her health state by rating each dimension on a 5-level scale (1=no problem, 5=extreme problem). This rating resulted in a 1-digit number expressing the level selected for that dimension. The digits for the 5 dimensions were combined in a 5-digit number describing the respondent's health state. The EQ-5D index scores ranges from 0 to 1, with 0=worst health state and 1=perfect health.
