A Study To Find Out How Fesoterodine Works In Children Aged 6 To 17 Years With Bladder Overactivity Caused By A Neurological Condition
CBCL: It consisted of 120 items on behavior and emotional problems. Parent/caregiver of child answered 120 items, each on scale: 0= not true, 1= somewhat/sometimes true, 2= very/often true. 103 items were classified in 8 domains: aggressive behavior: total score range (TSR)= 0 to 36, anxious/depressed: TSR= 0 to 26, attention problems: TSR= 0 to 20, rule-breaking behavior: TSR= 0 to 34, social problems: TSR= 0 to 22, somatic complaints: TSR= 0 to 22, thought problems: TSR= 0 to 30, withdrawn (TSR)= 0 to 16. Rule-breaking and aggressive behavior summarized to externalizing problems with a TSR= 0 to 70. Anxious/depressed, withdrawn, somatic complaints summarized to internalizing problems with a TSR= 0 to 64. All 103 items of 8 domains and other 17 remaining items were combined to give total problems TSR = 0 to 240. TSR for each domain, summary and total problems was sum of scores of related items respectively. Lower scores for each domain, summary and total problems= better outcomes.
