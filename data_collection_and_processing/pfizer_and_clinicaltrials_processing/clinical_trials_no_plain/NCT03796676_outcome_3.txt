The PSAAD is a daily patient reported symptom diary presented as a 15 item questionnaire that includes 11 items developed to measure symptoms of AD, along with 4 additional items for exploratory and psychometric validation purposes (Sleep & Usual Activities Questions and Patient Global Impression of Severity & Patient Global Impression of Change Questions). Participants answer each question about skin condition based on a 24 hour recall. Each question was evaluated on a 11-point scale ranging from 0 to 10, where higher scores indicate more impact on skin condition.The PSAAD total score is calculated as the average of the responses to each of the 11 items and ranges from 0 (none) to 10 (extreme), where higher scores indicate worse severity of AD symptoms.
