Crisaborole Ointment 2% Skin Biomarker Biopsy Study in Atopic Dermatitis
This study is being conducted to characterize the mechanism of action of crisaborole ointment 2%, by evaluation of efficacy and changes in key skin biomarkers in atopic dermatitis (AD) lesions treated with crisaborole ointment 2% over vehicle, in subjects with mild to moderate AD. Two identified AD skin lesions for each subject will be treated for the first 15 days, one with crisaborole ointment 2% and one with vehicle, in a blinded manner, and biopsies for biomarker analysis will be performed on the lesions. Following completion of the blinded treatment period, subjects will start the 28 day open label period during which all AD affected skin lesions will be treated with crisaborole ointment 2% twice daily.
