A Phase 2 Study to Evaluate the Safety, Efficacy, Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics of PF-06252616 in Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy
The PUL was used to assess motor performance of the upper limb. The PUL scale includes 22 items; an entry item defining the starting functional level, and 21 items subdivided into three levels: shoulder (4 items), middle (9 items) and distal (8 items). Scoring options per item may not be uniform and may vary from 0-1 and 0-6, according to the performance, with higher values corresponding to better performance. A total maximum score of 74 is achieved by adding the individual level scores. A subset analysis was performed by categorizing participants into 3 subsets according to the baseline 4SC time. MMRM was used to analyze the change from baseline .The stratification factor, baseline result, treatment, time and treatment by time interaction were included as fixed effects in the model. Participants were included as a random effect and the model was fit with an unstructured covariance for the repeated measures.
