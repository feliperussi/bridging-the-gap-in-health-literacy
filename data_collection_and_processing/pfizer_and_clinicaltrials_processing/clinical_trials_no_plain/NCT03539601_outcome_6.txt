A Study of Crisaborole Ointment 2%; Crisaborole Vehicle; TCS and TCI in Subjects Aged â‰¥ 2 Years, With Mild-moderate AD
ISGA is a five point global assessment scale of AD severity, used to characterize participants' overall disease severity across all treatable AD lesions (excluding the scalp). ISGA score ranged from 0 to 4: where 0 = clear (minor residual hypo/hyperpigmentation; no erythema or induration/papulation; no oozing/crusting), 1= almost clear (trace faint pink erythema, with barely perceptible induration/papulation and no oozing/crusting), 2= mild (faint pink erythema with mild induration/papulation and no oozing/crusting), 3= moderate (pink-red erythema with moderate induration/papulation with or without oozing/crusting), 4= severe (deep or bright red erythema with severe induration/papulation and with oozing/crusting). Higher scores indicated greater severity of AD.
