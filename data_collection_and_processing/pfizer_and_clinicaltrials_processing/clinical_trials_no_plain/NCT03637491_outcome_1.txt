A Study of Avelumab, Binimetinib and Talazoparib in Patients With Locally Advanced or Metastatic RAS-mutant Solid Tumors
Confirmed OR, defined as a complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) per RECIST v1.1. CR was defined as complete disappearance of all target and non-target lesions, with the exception of nodal disease and sustained for at least 4 weeks. Any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) must have reduction in short axis to less than (<) 10 mm. PR was defined as at least 30% decrease in the sum of the longest dimensions of target lesions taking as reference the baseline sum longest dimensions. Both CR and PR must be confirmed by repeated assessments performed no less than 4 weeks after the criteria for response were first met.
