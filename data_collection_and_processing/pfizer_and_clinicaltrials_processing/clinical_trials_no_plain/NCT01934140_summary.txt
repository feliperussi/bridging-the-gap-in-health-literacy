Study to Evaluate the Long-term Antibody Persistence of GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) Biologicals' MenACWY-TT Vaccine (GSK134612) Versus Mencevax ACWY in Healthy Adolescents and Adults and Booster Response to MenACWY-TT Vaccine Administered at 10 Years Post-primary Vaccination
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the long-term antibody persistence from 6, 7, 8, 9 to 10 years post-administration of MenACWY-TT conjugate vaccine as compared to Mencevax ACWY when given to healthy subjects 11 to 55 years of age. In addition, the safety and immunogenicity of a booster dose of MenACWY-TT vaccine administered to all eligible subjects 10 years after the primary vaccination will be evaluated.

All Filipino subjects who received the primary vaccination in the primary vaccination study 107386 (NCT00356369) will be invited to enrol in the long-term follow up and booster phase. No new subjects will be enrolled.
