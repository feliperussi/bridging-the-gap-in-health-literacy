Study to Evaluate the Safety and Immunogenicity of a Multivalent Pneumococcal Vaccine Given With Prevnar 13 in Healthy Infants
This is a Phase 2, randomized, active-controlled, open-label study with a 3-arm parallel design. Healthy 2-month old infants (42 to 98 days of age) with no history of pneumococcal vaccination will be randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive a 4-dose series of: multivalent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine coadministered with Prevnar 13 (Group 1); multivalent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine given 1 month after Prevnar 13 (Group 2); or Prevnar 13 with a single dose of multivalent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (Group 3).
