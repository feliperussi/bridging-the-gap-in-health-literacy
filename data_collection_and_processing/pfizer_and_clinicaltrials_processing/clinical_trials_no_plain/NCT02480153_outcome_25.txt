A Study Of PF-06410293 (Adalimumab-Pfizer) And Adalimumab (HumiraÂ®) In Combination With Methotrexate In Subjects With Active Rheumatoid Arthritis (REFLECTIONS B538-02).
HAQ-DI assesses the degree of difficulty a participant had experienced during the past week in 8 domains of daily activities: dressing and grooming, arising, eating, walking, hygiene, reach, grip and other activities. Each activity category consisted of 2-3 items. For each question in the questionnaire, the level of difficulty was scored from 0 to 3 with 0 representing "no difficulty", 1 as "some difficulty", 2 as "much difficulty", and 3 as "unable to do". Any activity that required assistance from another individual or required the use of an assistive device would adjust to a minimum score of 2 to represent a more limited functional status. Overall score was computed as the sum of scores divided by the number of domains answered. Total possible score range was 0-3 with 0 representing "no difficulty", 1 as "some difficulty", 2 as "much difficulty", and 3 as "unable to do". Higher score indicate more difficulty in performing daily living activities.
