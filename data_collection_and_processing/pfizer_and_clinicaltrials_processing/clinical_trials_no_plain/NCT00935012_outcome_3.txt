Safety And Efficacy Evaluation Of Fx-1006a In Patients With V122i Or Wild-Type Transthyretin (TTR) Amyloid Cardiomyopathy
NYHA classified participants in 4 classes: Class I: cardiac disease without limitations of physical activity. Ordinary physical activity caused no undue fatigue, palpitation, dyspnea or angina pain. Class II: cardiac disease with slight limitation of physical activity, comfortable at rest. Ordinary physical activity resulted in fatigue, palpitation, dyspnea or angina pain. Class III: cardiac disease with marked limitation of physical activity, comfortable at rest. Less than ordinary physical activity caused fatigue, palpitation, dyspnea or angina pain. Class IV: cardiac disease with inability to carry on any physical activity without discomfort. Symptoms of cardiac insufficiency or angina syndrome might be present even at rest. If any physical activity was undertaken, discomfort was increased. Participants with change from baseline were classified as improved (shifted from higher to lower class), unchanged (no change in class) or worsened (shifted from lower to higher class).
