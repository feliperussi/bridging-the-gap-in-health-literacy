Dose Ranging Study to Assess Efficacy, Safety, Tolerability and Pharmacokinetics of PF-06700841 Topical Cream in Participants With Mild or Moderate Atopic Dermatitis
Local tolerability skin assessments were performed by the investigator and graded based on severity from grade 0 to 4 as: grade 0=none (no evidence of local intolerance); grade 1=mild (minimal erythema and/or oedema, slight glazed appearance); grade 2= moderate (definite erythema and/or oedema with peeling and/or cracking but needs no adaptation of posology) grade 3=severe (erythema, oedema glazing with fissures, few vesicles or papules consider removing topical agent [if still in place]) and grade 4= very severe (strong reaction spreading beyond the treated area, bullous reaction, erosions: removal of topical agent [if still in place]). Higher grades indicated worsening of condition. Only those categories in which at least 1 participant had data were reported.
