Phase 3 Study on the Efficacy and Safety of Tanezumab in Patients With Cancer Pain Due to Bone Metastasis Who Are Taking Background Opioid Therapy
Daily average pain intensity in the non-index visceral cancer pain site was assessed by participants on an 11 point pain intensity NRS ranging from 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst possible pain), where higher scores signified more severity of pain. The participants described their pain at the painful site during the past 24 hours by choosing the appropriate number from 0 to 10 on IRT diaries. Baseline is defined as the mean average daily pain intensity NRS score during the baseline assessment period prior to randomization. The Weeks 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16 and 24 pain intensity value is the mean of the daily average pain intensity scores for the 7 days prior to the each specified week.
