Safety and Efficacy of Tafamidis in Patients With Transthyretin Cardiomyopathy
KCCQ is a 23-item participant-completed questionnaire that assesses health status and health-related quality of life in participants with heart failure. Eight domain scores were calculated for the KCCQ: Physical limitation, Social limitation, Quality of life, Self-efficacy, Symptom stability, Symptom frequency, Symptom burden, and Total symptoms (calculated as the mean of Symptom frequency and Symptom burden scores). Two summary scores were also calculated: Clinical Summary (calculated as mean of Physical limitation and Total symptom scores) and Overall Summary (calculated as mean of Physical limitation, Social limitation, Total symptoms, and Quality of life scores). Domain and summary scores were scaled to range from 0 (minimum) to 100 (maximum); higher scores represent better health status.
