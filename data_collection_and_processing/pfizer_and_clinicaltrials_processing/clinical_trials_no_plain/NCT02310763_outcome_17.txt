A Phase 2 Study to Evaluate the Safety, Efficacy, Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics of PF-06252616 in Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy
The LVEF was the ratio of blood ejected during systole to blood in the ventricle at the end of diastole. LVEF was measured by cardiac magnetic resonance image (MRI) or echocardiogram. The same method of cardiac imaging was used consistently within a single participant. Cardiac MRIs were read by a central imaging vendor and echocardiograms were read locally at each site. The LVEF values measured by cardiac MRI and echocardiogram are combined in the following presentation. The analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model was used to analyze the change from baseline for domagrozumab compared to placebo on LVEF. The baseline result, age, use of angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB)/beta blocker/angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor and treatment were included as fixed effects in the model.
