Safety and Efficacy Study of Enzalutamide in Patients With Nonmetastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer
Pain was assessed using the score from the Brief Pain Inventory-Short Form (BPI-SF) question 3: "Please rate your pain by marking the box beside the number that best describes your pain at its worst in the last 24 hours." Time to this event was defined as the time from randomization to onset of pain progression, where pain progression was defined as a 2-point or more increase from baseline in the question 3 score. Participants without observed pain progression at the time of analysis were right censored at the date of last pain assessment for the purposes of analysis. Analysis was based on Kaplan-Meier estimates.
