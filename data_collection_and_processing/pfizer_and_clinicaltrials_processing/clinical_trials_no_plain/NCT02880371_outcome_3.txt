A Study of ARRY-382 in Combination With Pembrolizumab for the Treatment of Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors
DOR was defined as the time from the date of the first documented response (CR or PR) to the earliest date of disease progression, or death due to any cause after achieving a response. As per RECIST v1.1: CR = disappearance of target and non-target lesions and normalization of tumor markers. Pathological lymph nodes must have short axis measures < 10 mm. PR = at least a 30% decrease in the sum of measures (longest diameter for tumor lesions and short axis measure for nodes) of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum of diameters. PD = at least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of measured lesions taking as references the smallest sum of diameters recorded on study (including baseline) and an absolute increase of >= 5 mm or appearance of at least 1 new lesion. Unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions. DOR was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method.
