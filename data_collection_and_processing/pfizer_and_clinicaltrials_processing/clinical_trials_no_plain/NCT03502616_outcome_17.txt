Efficacy and Safety of Tofacitinib in Subjects With Active Ankylosing Spondylitis (AS)
BASMI assessed axial status and spinal mobility. BASMI - Linear Method score was average of 5 individual component scores mapped between 0 and 10, with higher scores indicating more impairment of axial status and spinal mobility. For the assessment of lumbar flexion, With the participant standing erect and outer edges of feet 30 cm apart, a mark was placed in the midpoint of a line that joins the posterior superior iliac spines (baseline mark). A second mark (A) was placed 10 cm above the baseline mark and a third mark (B) 5 cm below the baseline mark. Then have the participant maximally bend forward, keeping the knees fully extended. With the participant's spine in full flexion, the distance between marks A and B (in cm to the nearest 0.1 cm) was re-measured. Distance (in cm) was greater than or equal to 0, with no maximum defined range. Higher value indicates better health status.
