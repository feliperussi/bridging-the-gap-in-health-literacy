A Combination Study of PF-04449913 (Glasdegib) and Azacitidine In Untreated MDS, AML and CMML Patients
Percentage of participants achieving CR as defined by the 2017 European Leukemia Net (ELN) Response Criteria for all participants with AML and modified International Working Group (IWG) criteria (2006) for all participants with MDS in the expansion cohorts.

For AML cohort, CR was defined as neutrophils ≥ 1 x 10^9/L, platelets ≥ 1 x 10^11/L, percentage of bone marrow blasts (BMB) <5% with no peripheral blasts and no blasts with Auer rods, no extramedullary disease (EMD), and transfusion independent.

For MDS cohort, CR was defined as having responses of hemoglobin ≥11 g/dL, neutrophils ≥1 x 10^9/L, platelets ≥1 x 10^11/L, percentage of blasts = 0%, percentage of BMB≤5%, and normal maturation of all cell lines (note if has persistent dysplasia), and all responses must last at least 4 weeks.
