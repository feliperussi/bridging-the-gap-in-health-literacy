Talazoparib For Neoadjuvant Treatment Of Germline BRCA1/2 Mutation Patients With Early Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2 Negative Breast Cancer
EORTC-QLQ-BR23 is a 23-item breast cancer module developed as a supplement for the EORTC-QLQ-C30 to assess the quality of life of participants with breast cancer, consisting of 2 functional scales, 3 symptoms scales, and 3 single-item scales. Each scale has 4 possible scores (1=not at all, 2=a little, 3=quite a bit, 4=very much). A linear transformation was applied to the raw scores so that all transformed scores lie between 0 to 100, with 0 being the worst and 100 being the best for functional scales, and 0 being the best and 100 being the worst for symptoms scales.

For the functional scale of body image, participants self-rated how much they felt physically less attractive or less feminine, difficult to look at themselves naked, or dissatisfied with their body during the past week. Negative change from baseline indicates worsening of self-rated body image and positive change indicates improvement.
