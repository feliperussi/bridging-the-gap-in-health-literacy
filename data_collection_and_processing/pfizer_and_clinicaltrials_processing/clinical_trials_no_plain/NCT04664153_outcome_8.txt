Study To Assess Efficacy, Safety, Tolerability And Pharmacokinetics Of PF-07038124 Ointment In Participants With Atopic Dermatitis Or Plaque Psoriasis
The PASI quantified the severity of a participant's psoriasis based on both, "lesion severity" and the "percent of BSA" affected. PASI was a composite scoring by the investigator of degree of erythema, induration, and scaling (each scored separately) for each of 4 body regions (head and neck, upper limbs, trunk [including axillae and groin], and lower limbs [including buttocks]), with adjustment for the percent of BSA involved for each body region and for the proportion of the body region to the whole body. The PASI score could vary in increments of 0.1 and range from 0.0 to 72.0, with higher scores representing greater severity of psoriasis. PASI 75 response was defined as at least a 75 percent (%) reduction in PASI relative to Baseline.
