A Study Of Avelumab In Combination With Axitinib In Advanced Renal Cell Cancer (JAVELIN Renal 100)
This is a Phase 1b, open-label, multi-center, multiple-dose trial designed to estimate the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and select the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of avelumab (MSB0010718C) in combination with axitinib (AG-013736). Once the MTD of avelumab administered in combination with axitinib is estimated (dose finding portion), the dose expansion phase will be opened to further characterize the combination in term of safety profile, anti tumor activity, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and biomarker modulation.
