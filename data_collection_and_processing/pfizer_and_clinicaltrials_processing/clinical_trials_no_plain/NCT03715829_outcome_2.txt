A Phase 2b Study To Evaluate The Efficacy And Safety Profile Of PF-06651600 And PF-06700841 In Active Non-segmental Vitiligo Subjects
Total body VASI (T-VASI) was calculated using a formula that included contribution from 6 different body regions (possible range, 0-100) with a modified method: T-VASI= Ʃ[Hand Units]×[Depigmentation]. One hand unit, which encompassed the palm plus the volar surface of all the digits, was approximately 1% of the total body surface area and was used as a guide to estimate the baseline percentage of vitiligo involvement of each body region. The body was divided into 6 separate and mutually exclusive regions: face/neck, hands, upper extremities (excluding hands), trunk, lower extremities (excluding feet), and feet. The extent of depigmentation was expressed by percentages: 0, 10%, 25%, 50%, 75%, 90% or 100%. The data below was the percentage of participants achieving at least 50% improvement from baseline in T-VASI (T-VASI50) at Week 24. Negative percent change from baseline in T-VASI signified an improvement. Baseline was defined as the last measurement prior to first dosing (Day 1).
