Efficacy and Safety of Tofacitinib in Subjects With Active Ankylosing Spondylitis (AS)
BASMI assess axial status, spinal mobility, using linear function. It composed of 5 clinical measures. BASMI - Linear Method score-average of 5 component scores mapped between 0 and 10, with high scores =more impairment of axial status, spinal mobility. For assessment of lateral spinal flexion: participant stand upright with head and back rest against wall as close as possible with shoulders level and feet 30 cm apart and feet parallel. At tip of middle finger, place a mark on thigh. This neutral position recorded. Participant bend sideways without bending knees or lifting heels while attempting to keep shoulders in same position (flexion position). Second mark placed, lateral flexion recorded (left or right as appropriate) using cm tape measure. Two tries for left, two tries for right measured. Result of two tries recorded for left and right separately in cm to nearest 0.1 cm. Distance (in cm) should be >=0, with no maximum defined range: high value indicates better health status.
