A Safety, Efficacy, and Tolerability Trial of Pregabalin as Add-On Treatment in Pediatric Subjects <4 Years of Age With Partial Onset Seizures.
Criteria for abnormalities in ECG findings: 1) Time from ECG Q wave to the end of the S wave corresponding to ventricle depolarization (QRS complex): >=140 milliseconds (msec); 2) The interval between the start of the P wave and the start of the QRS complex, corresponding to the time between the onset of the atrial depolarization and onset of ventricular depolarization (PR interval): >=200 msec; 3) Time from ECG Q wave to the end of the T wave corresponding to electrical systole corrected for heart rate using Fridericia's formula (QTCF interval): absolute value 450 to <480 msec, 480 to <500 msec, >=500 msec; 4) Maximum QT interval: >=500 msec; 5) Maximum QTCB interval (Bazett's correction): 450 to< 480 msec, 480 to <500 msec, >=500 msec. Only those categories of ECG abnormalities in which participants were found abnormal (maximum QTCB interval 450-<480 msec), were reported in this outcome measure.
