Efficacy and Safety of Tofacitinib in Subjects With Active Ankylosing Spondylitis (AS)
BASMI assessed axial status and spinal mobility, using linear function. It composed of 5 clinical measures: lateral spinal flexion, tragus-to-wall distance, lumbar flexion (modified Schober), maximal intermalleolar distance, cervical rotation. BASMI - Linear Method score was average of 5 individual component scores mapped between 0 and 10, with higher scores indicating more impairment of axial status and spinal mobility. For the assessment of intermalleolar distances, participant should lie supine with the knees straight and feet/toes pointing straight up and asked to separate the legs as far as possible and the distance between the medial malleoli was measured (in Centimeters [cm] to the nearest 0.1 cm). Distance (in cm) was greater than or equal to 0, with no maximum defined range: higher intermalleolar distance value indicates better health status.
