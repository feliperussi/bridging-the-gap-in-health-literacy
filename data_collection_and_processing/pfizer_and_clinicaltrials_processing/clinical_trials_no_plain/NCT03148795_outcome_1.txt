A Study of Talazoparib in Men With DNA Repair Defects and Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer
Time to objective response was defined as the time from first dose of talazoparib to the first objective evidence of soft tissue response with no evidence of confirmed bone disease progression on bone scan per prostate cancer working Group 3 (PCWG3). Soft tissue response is defined as a best overall response of CR or PR per RECIST 1.1 by independent central review. RECIST 1.1 criteria, CR: disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) must have reduction in short axis to less than 10 mm. Disappearance of all non-target lesions and normalization of tumor marker level. All lymph nodes must be non-pathological in size (less than 10 mm short axis); PR: at least 30 % decrease in sum of diameters of target lesions taking as reference baseline sum diameters.
