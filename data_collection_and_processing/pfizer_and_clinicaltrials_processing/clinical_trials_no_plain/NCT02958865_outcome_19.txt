Study to Compare Oral PF-06651600, PF-06700841 and Placebo in Subjects With Moderate to Severe Ulcerative Colitis
The Mayo Score is a tool designed to measure disease activity for ulcerative colitis. The Mayo scoring system ranges from 0 to 12 points and consists of 4 subscores, which are stool frequency, rectal bleeding, findings on endoscopy and physician's global assessment. Each subscore graded 0 to 3 with the higher score indicating more severe disease activity. Clinical response was defined as decrease from baseline in total Mayo score of at least 3 points and at least 30%, with an accompanying decrease in the subscore for rectal bleeding of at least 1 point or absolute subscore for rectal bleeding of 0 or 1.
