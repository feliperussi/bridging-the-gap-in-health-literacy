A Study Of PF-06463922 An ALK/ROS1 Inhibitor In Patients With Advanced Non Small Cell Lung Cancer With Specific Molecular Alterations
This test was performed in the same way as the International Shopping List Test, with the exception that, the delayed recall condition required the participant to recall the words from the list 15 30 minutes later without having the list read again. During the recognition condition, the qualified personnel read a shopping list item that may or may not have been on the original list and the participant had to respond either affirmatively (if the item was on the original list) or negatively (if it was not). Total number of correct responses made in remembering the word list after a delay was recorded. Lower values of least square mean change from baseline indicate performance decline. Upper limit of 95% confidence interval of -0.00 or lower indicate statistically significant decline of performance over baseline at that cycle.
