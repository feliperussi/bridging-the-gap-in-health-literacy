Efficacy and Safety of Tofacitinib in Subjects With Active Ankylosing Spondylitis (AS)
FACIT-F is a 13-item questionnaire (felt fatigued, felt weak all over, felt listless ["washed out"],felt tired, had energy, had trouble starting things as tired, had trouble finishing things as tired, was able to do usual activities, needed to sleep during day, too tired to eat, needed help doing my usual activities, frustrated by being too tired to do things wanted to do, had to limit my social activity because tired), with each item scored on a 5-point scale ranging from 0 (not at all) to 4 (very much). Three type of scores were derived: change in FACIT-F total score, change in FACIT-F experience domain score, and change in FACIT-F impact domain score. FACIT-F total score was calculated by summing the 13 items (range 0 [not at all] to 52 [very much]); higher scores represent less fatigue status. In this outcome measure, change from baseline in FACIT-F total score was reported.
