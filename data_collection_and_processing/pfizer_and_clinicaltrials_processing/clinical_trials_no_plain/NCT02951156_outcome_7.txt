Avelumab In Combination Regimens That Include An Immune Agonist, Epigenetic Modulator, CD20 Antagonist and/or Conventional Chemotherapy in Patients With Relapsed or Refractory Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma (R/R DLBCL)
Disease control rate was defined as percentage of participants with disease control. Disease Control (DC) was defined as the best overall response of CR, PR, or stable disease (SD). CR: score of 1 (no uptake above background), 2 (uptake <= mediastinum), or 3 (uptake less than <mediastinum but <=liver) with or without a residual mass on PET 5-PS, for lymph nodes and extralymphatic sites; no new lesions; no evidence of FDG-avid disease in bone marrow. PR: >=50% decrease in SPD of up to six of the largest dominant lymph nodes, no increase in size of other nodes, liver, or spleen volume, a >=50% decrease in SPD of hepatic and splenic nodules, absence of other organ involvement, and no new sites of disease. SD: <50% decrease in SDP of up to 6 dominant, measurable nodes and extranodal sites; no criteria for progressive disease met. To qualify as a best overall response of SD, at least one SD assessment must be observed >=6 weeks after start date and before disease progression.
