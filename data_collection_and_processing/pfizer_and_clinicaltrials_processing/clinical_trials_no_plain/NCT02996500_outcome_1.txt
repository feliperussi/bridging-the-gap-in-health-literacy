Safety and Efficacy of Pf-06650833 In Subjects With Rheumatoid Arthritis, With An Inadequate Response To Methotrexate
The SDAI is a continuous composite measure derived from components of the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) Core Dataset.The SDAI was calculated using the following formula: SDAI = TJC (using 28 joints) + SJC (using 28 joints) + PtGA (0-10 cm scale) + PhGA (0-10 cm scale) + hsCRP (mg/dL). SDAI total score= 0-86. SDAI <=3.3 indicates disease remission, >3.4 to 11 = low disease activity, >11 to 26 = moderate disease activity, and >26 = high disease activity. The descriptive summary of change from baseline in SDAI was based on a mixed effect model repeat measurement MMRM model with observed data. Tofacitinib was included in this study as an active control. The efficacy endpoint for the tofatinicib arm was an exploratory endpoint and neither primary nor secondary endpoints.
