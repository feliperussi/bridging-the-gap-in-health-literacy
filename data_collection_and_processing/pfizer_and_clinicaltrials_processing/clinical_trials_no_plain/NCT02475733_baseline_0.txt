Evaluation of Safety,Pharmacokinetics and Efficacy of CAZ-AVI With Metronidazole in Children Aged 3 Months to 18 Years Old With Complicated Intra-abdominal Infections (cIAIs).
Participants with Creatinine clearance(CrCL) >=50 milliliter per minute (mL/min) received 10 milligram per kilogram (mg/kg) intravenous(IV) infusion of metronidazole over 20 to 30 minutes along with 2 hour IV infusion of CAZ/AVI in following manner: 1)Age 6 to less than(<)18 years: 2000 mg CAZ/500 mg AVI (body weight >=40 kg), 50 mg/kg CAZ/12.5 mg/kg AVI (body weight <40 kg), 2) Age 6 months to <6 years: 50 mg/kg CAZ/12.5 mg/kg AVI, 3)Age 3 months to <6 months: 40 mg/kg CAZ/10 mg/kg AVI. Both infusions were administered to participants every 8 hours for a minimum of 72 hours and up to a maximum duration of 15 days. Dose of CAZ-AVI was drops below to 50% if CrCl of participant drops below to 50mL/min, and participant was removed from study therapy, if CrCl decreased below 30mL/min. After having 72 hours of IV treatment, participants had option to switch to an oral therapy at investigator's discretion.
