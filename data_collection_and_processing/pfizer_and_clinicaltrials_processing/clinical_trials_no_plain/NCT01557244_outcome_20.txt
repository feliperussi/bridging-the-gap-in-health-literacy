Summary scores: Internalizing problems=anxious/depressed + withdrawn + somatic complaints; Externalizing problems=rule-breaking + aggressive behavior. Total problems=8 domains + other 17 items. Raw scores for each domain, summary and total problems=sum of scores of related items. Using Assessment Data Manager (ADM) tool raw scores transformed/derived into standard T-scores, range: each domain=50 to 100, internalizing problems=34 to 100, externalizing problems=33 to 100, total problems=24 to 100. Lower T-score for each 8 domains, 2 summary and total problems scores=better outcomes.
