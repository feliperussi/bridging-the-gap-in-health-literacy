A Combination Study of PF-04449913 (Glasdegib) and Azacitidine In Untreated MDS, AML and CMML Patients
Number of participants with CR with partial hematologic recovery (CRh), CR with incomplete blood count recovery (CRi), partial remission (PR), stable disease (SD), and morphologic leukemia free state (MLFS). CRh: neutrophils>5x10^8/L, platelets>5x10^10/L, BMB<5%, no peripheral blasts, no blasts with Auer rods, no extramedullary disease (EMD), not qualifying for CR. CRi: neutrophils <1x10^9/L or platelets<1x10^11/L; BMB <5%, no peripheral blasts, no blasts with Auer rods; no EMD; neutrophils or platelets not recovered; not qualifying for CRh. PR: neutrophils ≥1x10^9/L; platelets ≥1x10^11/L; blasts decreased to 5-25% and ≥50% decrease from pretreatment; blasts≤5% if Auer rod positive. SD: ≥3 months of absence of CR without minimal residual disease (CRMRD-), CR, CRh, CRi, PR, and MLFS, criteria for PD not met. MLFS: neutrophils <1x10^9/L and platelets<1x10^11/L, BMB<5%, no blasts with Auer rods; no EMD; neutrophils and platelets not recovered; not qualifying for CRi
