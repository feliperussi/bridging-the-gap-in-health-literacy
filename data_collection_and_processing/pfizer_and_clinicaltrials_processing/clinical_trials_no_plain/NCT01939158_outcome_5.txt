Geometric mean titers of antibodies against each serogroup were assessed using rSBA. Serogroups included neisseria meningitidis serogroup A (MenA), Neisseria meningitidis serogroup C (MenC), Neisseria meningitidis serogroup W-135 (MenW-135) and Neisseria meningitidis serogroup Y (MenY). rSBA titers are expressed as 1/dilution. ATP cohort for persistence Year 3 included all participants who met eligibility criteria, received complete primary vaccination series, had assay results available for at least 1 antigen tested, complied with procedures and intervals in protocol, did not present medical condition, received product or were non-compliant with protocol-defined serum sampling windows or lack of availability of immunogenicity results at the previous time point.
