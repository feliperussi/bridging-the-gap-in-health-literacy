A Study of ARRY-382 in Combination With Pembrolizumab for the Treatment of Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors
ORR was defined as the percentage of participants who achieved a BOR of CR or PR as determined by investigator review of radiographic disease assessments per RECIST v1.1. As per RECIST v1.1: CR = disappearance of target and non-target lesions and normalization of tumor markers. Pathological lymph nodes must have short axis measures <10 mm. PR = at least a 30% decrease in the sum of measures (longest diameter for tumor lesions and short axis measure for nodes) of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum of diameters. Non-target lesions must be non-PD. The analysis was based on confirmed responses for which CR or PR must be confirmed by repeat disease assessment studies performed no less than 4 weeks after the criteria for response were first met to qualify as CR or PR, respectively.
