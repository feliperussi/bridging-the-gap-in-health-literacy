Trial to Evaluate the Safety and Immunogenicity of 3 Lots of 20-valent Pneumococcal Conjugate Vaccine in Pneumococcal Vaccine-NaÃ¯ve Adults
Local reactions were recorded using an electronic diary. Local reactions included redness, swelling and pain at the injection site. Redness and swelling were measured and recorded in measuring device units. 1 measuring device unit =0.5 centimeter (cm). Redness and swelling were graded as mild (greater than [>] 2.0 to 5.0 cm), moderate (>5.0 to 10.0 cm) and severe (>10.0 cm). Pain at injection site was graded as mild (did not interfere with activity), moderate (interfered with activity), and severe (prevented daily activity). Data for this outcome measure was planned to be analyzed for the pooled 20vPnC vaccine groups (20vPnC Lots 1, 2 and 3) and 13vPnC group.
