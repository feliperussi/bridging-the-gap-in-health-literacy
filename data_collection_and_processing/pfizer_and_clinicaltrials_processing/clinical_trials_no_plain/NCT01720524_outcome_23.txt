A Study To Evaluate Safety And Efficacy Of IV Sildenafil In The Treatment Of Neonates With Persistent Pulmonary Hypertension Of The Newborn
Audiological evaluations of participants were recorded and reported by air conduction via phones/headphones through pure tone audiometry test which included participants with hearing loss ranged from less than or equal to (<=) 20 decibel hearing loss (DB HL), 21-40 DB HL, 41-70 DB HL, 71-90 DB HL, greater than (>) 90 DB HL or no response, and missing at frequencies ranged from 500 Hertz (Hz) to 8000 Hz at month 12 and 24. In this outcome measure, data have been reported for right and left ear separately. Rows according to air conduction categories at specified time points are reported in this outcome measure, only when there was a non-zero data for at least 1 reporting arm.
