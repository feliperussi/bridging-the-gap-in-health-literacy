Safety and Efficacy Study of MDV3100 in Patients With Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer Who Have Been Previously Treated With Docetaxel-based Chemotherapy
The FACT-P was a 39-item participant questionnaire which assessed physical well-being (7 items), social/family well-being (7 items), emotional well-being (6 items), functional well-being (7 items), and additional prostate cancer specific concerns (12 items). All items were scored from 0 (not at all) to 4 (very much). The sum of scores on all 5 domains constitutes the global FACT-P. The global/total FACT-P score ranged from 0 (worst) to 156 (best), higher scores indicate better health status. Responders were those participants who had a 10-point improvement in their total FACT-P score, as compared with baseline, on two consecutive measurements obtained at least 3 weeks apart.
