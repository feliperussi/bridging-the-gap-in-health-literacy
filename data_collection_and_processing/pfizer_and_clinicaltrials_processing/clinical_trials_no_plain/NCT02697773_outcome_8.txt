Efficacy and Safety of a Subcutaneous Tanezumab Titration Dosing Regimen in Subjects With Moderate to Severe Osteoarthritis of the Hip or Knee
PGA of osteoarthritis was assessed by asking a question from participants: "Considering all the ways your osteoarthritis in your knee or hip (index joint) affects you, how are you doing today?" Participants responded on a scale ranging from 1-5, where 1=very good (no symptom and no limitation of normal activities), 2= good (mild symptoms and no limitation of normal activities), 3= fair (moderate symptoms and limitation of some normal activities), 4= poor (severe symptoms and inability to carry out most normal activities), and 5 = very poor (very severe symptoms and inability to carry out all normal activities). Higher scores indicated worse condition.
