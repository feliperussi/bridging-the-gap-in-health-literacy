Safety and Efficacy of Pf-06650833 In Subjects With Rheumatoid Arthritis, With An Inadequate Response To Methotrexate
The EQ-5D-3L health state profile is a patient completed questionnaire designed to assess impact on health related quality of life in 5 domains: mobility, self care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. Additionally, scores from the 5 domains might have been used to calculate a single index value, also known as a utility score. The validity and reliability of the EQ-5D-3L have been established in a number of disease states, including RA. EQ-5D-3L scores marked health status from 0 and 100. There were notes at the both ends of the scale that the bottom rate (0) corresponded to " the worst health you could imagine", and the highest rate (100) corresponded to "the best health you could imagine". Tofacitinib was included in this study as an active control. The efficacy endpoint for the tofatinicib arm was an exploratory endpoint and neither primary nor secondary endpoints.
