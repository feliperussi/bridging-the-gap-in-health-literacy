A Study of Crisaborole Ointment 2%; Crisaborole Vehicle; TCS and TCI in Subjects Aged â‰¥ 2 Years, With Mild-moderate AD
EASI quantifies severity of participant's AD (excluded scalp) based on lesion severity and %BSA affected. Lesion severity included erythema (E), induration/papulation (I), excoriation (Ex), lichenification (L) scored for 4 regions (head and neck [h], upper limbs [u], trunk [t] [including axillae, groin], lower limbs [l] [including buttocks]) on 4-point scale: 0= absent; 1= mild; 2= moderate; 3= severe. EASI area score(A) based upon %BSA with AD in body region: 0 (0%), 1 (>0 to <10%), 2 (10 to <30%), 3 (30 to <50%), 4 (50 to <70%), 5 (70 to <90%), 6 (90 to 100%). Total EASI score (aged >=8 years) =0.1*Ah*(Eh + Ih + Exh + Lh) + 0.2*Au*(Eu + Iu + Exu + Lu) + 0.3*At*(Et + It +Ext + Lt) + 0.4*Al*(El + Il + Exl + Ll); for aged 2 to <8 years =0.2*Ah*(Eh + Ih + Exh + Lh) + 0.2*Au*(Eu + Iu + Exu + Lu) + 0.3*At*(Et +It + Ext + Lt) + 0.3*Al*(El + Il + Exl + Ll). Total score ranges from 0.0 to 72.0, higher scores indicated greater AD severity.
