A Study to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of PF-06700841 in Subjects With Active Psoriatic Arthritis
The PASI quantifies the severity of a participant's psoriasis based on both lesion severity and the percentage of body surface area (BSA) affected. Assessments of lesion Severity Score and Area Score are performed separately for each of the four body regions: head (including neck), upper limbs, trunk (including axillae and groin), and lower limbs (including buttocks). In each body region, the sum of the lesion Severity Scores for erythema, induration and scaling is multiplied by the Area Score which represents the percentage of this area involved by psoriasis, multiplied by a weighting factor (head 0.1; upper limbs 0.2; trunk 0.3; lower limbs 0.4). The PASI score can vary in increments of 0.1 and range from 0.0 to 72.0, with higher scores representing greater severity of psoriasis. PASI 90 indicates a 90% or greater reduction in PASI scores from baseline.
