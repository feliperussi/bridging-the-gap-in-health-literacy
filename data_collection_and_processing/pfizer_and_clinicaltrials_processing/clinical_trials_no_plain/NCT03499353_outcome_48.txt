Talazoparib For Neoadjuvant Treatment Of Germline BRCA1/2 Mutation Patients With Early Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2 Negative Breast Cancer
EORTC-QLQ-BR23 is a 23-item breast cancer module developed as a supplement for the EORTC-QLQ-C30 to assess the quality of life of participants with breast cancer, consisting of 2 functional scales, 3 symptoms scales, and 3 single-item scales. Each scale has 4 possible scores (1=not at all, 2=a little, 3=quite a bit, 4=very much). A linear transformation was applied to the raw scores so that all transformed scores lie between 0 to 100, with 0 being the worst and 100 being the best for functional scales, and 0 being the best and 100 being the worst for symptoms scales.

For the functional scale of sexual enjoyment, participants self-rated to what extent sex was enjoyable for them during the past 4 weeks. Negative change from baseline values indicates worsening of sexual enjoyment and positive change indicates improvement.
