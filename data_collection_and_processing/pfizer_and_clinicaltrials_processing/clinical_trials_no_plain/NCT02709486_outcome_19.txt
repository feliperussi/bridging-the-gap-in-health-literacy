Study of the Analgesic Efficacy and Safety of Subcutaneous Tanezumab in Subjects With Osteoarthritis of the Hip or Knee.
WOMAC: self-administered, disease-specific questionnaire which assesses clinically important, participant-relevant symptoms for pain, stiffness and physical function in participants with OA of index joint (knee or hip). WOMAC pain subscale assess amount of pain experienced (score: 0 [no pain] to 10 [extreme pain], higher score = more pain), WOMAC physical function subscale assess degree of difficulty experienced (score: 0 [no difficulty] to 10 [extreme difficulty], higher score = worse physical function) and WOMAC stiffness subscale assess the amount of stiffness experienced (score: 0 [no stiffness] to 10 [extreme stiffness], higher score = higher stiffness). WOMAC average score was the mean of WOMAC pain, physical function and stiffness subscale scores and ranges from 0 to 10, where higher scores indicated worse response.
