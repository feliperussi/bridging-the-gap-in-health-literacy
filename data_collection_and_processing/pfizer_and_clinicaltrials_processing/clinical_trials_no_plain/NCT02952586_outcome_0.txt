Study To Compare Avelumab In Combination With Standard of Care Chemoradiotherapy (SoC CRT) Versus SoC CRT for Definitive Treatment In Patients With Locally Advanced Squamous Cell Carcinoma Of The Head And Neck (JAVELIN HEAD AND NECK 100)
PFS was defined as the time (in months) from the date of randomization to the first documentation of objective progressive disease (PD) per modified RECIST v1.1 as assessed by Investigator or death (due to any cause), whichever occurred first. Analysis was performed using Kaplan Meier method. PD refers to any of following: 1) Locoregional PD confirmed by pathology to verify radiographic changes represent true tumor progression and not radiation effects or non-malignant contrast enhancement. 2) Locoregional clinically detectable progression confirmed by pathology. 3) Surgical removal (salvage) of primary tumor with tumor present on final pathology. 4) Salvage neck dissection greater than (>) 20 weeks after completion of CRT with tumor present on final pathology. 5) Metastatic PD. PFS data was censored on date of last adequate tumor assessment for participants with no PFS event.
