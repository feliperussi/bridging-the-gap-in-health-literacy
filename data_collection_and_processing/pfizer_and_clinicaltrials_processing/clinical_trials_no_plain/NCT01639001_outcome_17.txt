A Study Of Crizotinib Versus Chemotherapy In Previously Untreated ALK Positive East Asian Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Patients
Agreement between central laboratory anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and ALK immunohistochemistry (IHC) test results is based on analysis of participants in the Molecular Profiling (MP) evaluable population that have an ALK IHC result and an ALK FISH result of either positive or negative only. This MP evaluable population included participants who screen failed, which their ALK test results were negative based on FISH test. Tumor tissue samples from these screen failure participants were consented and kept. These samples served as a part of negative sample set for evaluation of IHC test and/or polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to determine ALK fusion events. Participants with FISH results of uninformative and assay not performed and IHC results of valid IHC status not available were excluded from the analysis of agreement between central laboratory ALK FISH and ALK IHC test results.
