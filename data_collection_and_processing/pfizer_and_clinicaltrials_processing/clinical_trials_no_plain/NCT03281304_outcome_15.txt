A Study of Tofacitinib in Patients With Ulcerative Colitis in Stable Remission
Clinical response was defined as a decrease from baseline in mayo score of at least 3 points and at least 30 percent, with an accompanying decrease in the rectal bleeding subscore of at least 1 point or an absolute rectal bleeding subscore of 0 or 1. Mayo score is an instrument designed to measure disease activity of UC. It consisted of 4 subscores: stool frequency, rectal bleeding, findings of flexible sigmoidoscopy and PGA, each sub score graded from 0 to 3 with higher scores indicating more severe disease. PGA included 3 criteria: participant's recollection of abdominal discomfort, general sense of wellbeing and other observations such as physical findings and performance status. Individual subscores were summed up to give a mayo score range of 0 to 12, where higher scores indicating more severe disease.
