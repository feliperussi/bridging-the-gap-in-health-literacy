Long Term Safety and Efficacy Study of Tanezumab in Subjects With Osteoarthritis of the Hip or Knee
A 12-lead ECG was recorded after participants had rested for at least 5 minutes in the supine position in a quiet environment. All standard intervals (PR, QRS, QT, QTcF, QTcB, RR intervals) were collected. ECG abnormalities included: 1) QT interval, QT interval corrected using Bazett's formula (QTcB) and QT interval corrected using Fridericia's formula (QTcF): increase from baseline greater than (>) 30 millisecond (ms) or 60 ms; absolute value > 450 ms, >480 ms and > 500 ms; 2) heart rate (HR) : absolute value <=50 bpm and decrease from baseline >=20 bpm; absolute value >=120 beats per minute (bpm) and increase from baseline >=20 bpm; 3) PR interval: absolute value >=220 ms and increase from baseline >=20 ms; 4) QRS interval: absolute value >= 120 ms.
