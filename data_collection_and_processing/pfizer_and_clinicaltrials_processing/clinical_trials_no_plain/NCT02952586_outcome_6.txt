Study To Compare Avelumab In Combination With Standard of Care Chemoradiotherapy (SoC CRT) Versus SoC CRT for Definitive Treatment In Patients With Locally Advanced Squamous Cell Carcinoma Of The Head And Neck (JAVELIN HEAD AND NECK 100)
DOR:time from first documentation of objective tumor response (CR/PR) to first documentation of PD/death due to any cause, whichever occurred first.PR:>=30% decrease under baseline of sum of diameters of all target measurable lesions. CR for target disease:complete disappearance of all target lesions with exception of nodal disease.CR for non-target disease: disappearance of all non-target lesions and normalization of tumor marker levels. PD is any of following:1)Locoregional PD confirmed by pathology to verify radiographic changes denote true tumor progression and not radiation effects or non-malignant contrast enhancement.2)Locoregional clinically detectable progression confirmed by pathology.3)Surgical removal of primary tumor with tumor present on final pathology.4)Salvage neck dissection >20 weeks after completion of CRT with tumor present on final pathology.5)Metastatic PD. DOR data was censored on date of last adequate tumor assessment for participants with no overall response.
