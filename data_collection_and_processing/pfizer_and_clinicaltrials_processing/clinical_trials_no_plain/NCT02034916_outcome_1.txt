A Phase 2, 2-Stage, 2-Cohort Study of Talazoparib (BMN 673), in Locally Advanced and/or Metastatic Breast Cancer Patients With BRCA Mutation (ABRAZO Study)
CBR24: Percentage of participants with a best response of CR, PR or stable disease (SD) sustained for at least 24 weeks, as assessed by IRF using RECIST 1.1. CR: Disappearance of all non-nodal target and non-target lesions, including target and non-target lymph nodes reduction to <10 mm in short axis. PR: >=30% decrease in sum of diameters of target lesions, compared to the sum at baseline. SD: Neither PR nor progression of disease (PD) criteria met. SD follow PR only when sum increases by less than 20% from the nadir, but previously seen 30% decrease from baseline no longer hold. PD: >=20% increase (>=5 mm absolute increase) in the sum of target lesion measurements, compared to the smallest sum on study (including baseline), or unequivocal progression of non-target lesions, evaluated as a whole, such that it is clear that treatment has failed and disease is progressing, regardless of the status of the target lesions.
