Efficacy, Safety and Tolerability of PF-06687234 as Add-on Therapy to Infliximab in Active UC Subjects Not in Remission.
The Mayo score consists of 4 subscores (Endoscopic, stool frequency, rectal bleeding and Physician's global assessment [PGA]), each graded 0 to 3 with the higher score indicating more severe disease activity. Modified clinical remission is defined as a modified total Mayo Score (total Mayo score excluding the PGA subscore) <=2, no individual subscore >1, traditional endoscopic subscore <=1 (where mild friability was scored as of 1; moderate or severe friability was scored as 2) and rectal bleeding subscore=0. Participants with missing values were handled by treatment failure approach (participants who had missing value for any reasons were considered as treatment failures).
