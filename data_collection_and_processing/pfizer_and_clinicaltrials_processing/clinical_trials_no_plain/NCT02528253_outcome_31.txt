A Phase 3 Study of Tanezumab for Chronic Low Back Pain
WPAI: LBP is 6-question participant rated questionnaire that measures the effect of participant's chronic low back pain (CLBP) on general health and symptom severity on work productivity and regular activities. It yields 4 sub-scores: work time missed due to pain (absenteeism), impairment while working (presenteeism), overall work impairment (work productivity) and activity impairment (daily activity impairment). These sub-scores are expressed as an impairment percentage (range from 0 to 100), with higher numbers indicating greater impairment and less productivity. Pre-specified intent of study for efficacy data up to Week 16 was to analyze, participants who received placebo from Day 1 and received tanezumab 5/10 mg at week 16 in placebo arm, in pooled manner. Hence data have been reported per four arms.
