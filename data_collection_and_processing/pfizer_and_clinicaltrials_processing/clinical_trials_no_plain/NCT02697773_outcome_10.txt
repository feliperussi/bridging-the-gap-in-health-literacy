Efficacy and Safety of a Subcutaneous Tanezumab Titration Dosing Regimen in Subjects With Moderate to Severe Osteoarthritis of the Hip or Knee
Percentage of participants with reduction in WOMAC pain intensity of at least (>=) 30%, 50%, 70% and 90% at Weeks 2, 4, 8, 12, 16 and 24 compared to baseline were classified as responders to WOMAC pain subscale and are reported here. WOMAC: self-administered, disease-specific questionnaire which assesses clinically important, participant-relevant symptoms for pain, stiffness and physical function in participants with osteoarthritis. The WOMAC pain subscale is a 5-item questionnaire used to assess the amount of pain experienced due to osteoarthritis of index joint (knee or hip) during past 48 hours. It was calculated as the mean of scores from 5 individual questions scored on a numerical rating scale (NRS) of 0 (no pain) to 10 (extreme pain), where higher scores indicated higher pain. Missing data was imputed using mixed BOCF/LOCF.
