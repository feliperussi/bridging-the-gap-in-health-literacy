Study To Assess The Efficacy And Safety Of Pf-06651600 In Subjects With Rheumatoid Arthritis With An Inadequate Response To Methotrexate
Remission rate was defined as the percentage of participants with disease remission. DAS28 is measure of disease activity in participants with rheumatoid arthritis. DAS28-4 (ESR) was calculated from the number of SJC and TJC using the 28 joints count, the ESR (mm/hour) and participant's global assessment (PGA) of disease activity (participant rated arthritis activity assessment with transformed scores ranging 0 to 10; higher scores indicated greater affectation due to disease activity). Total score range: 0-9.4, higher score=more disease activity. DAS28-4 (ESR) <= 3.2 implied low disease activity and >3.2 to 5.1 implied moderate to high disease activity, and DAS28-4 (ESR) <2.6 = remission.
