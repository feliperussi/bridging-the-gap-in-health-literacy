An AE was any untoward medical occurrence in a participant who received study drug without regard to possibility of causal relationship. A SAE was an AE resulting in any of the following outcomes or deemed significant for any other reason: death; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; life-threatening experience (immediate risk of dying); persistent or significant disability/incapacity; congenital anomaly. A treatment-emergent AE (TEAE) was defined as an AE that occurred from the date and time of the first dose of study drug through the date of last dose +30 days (or the day before initiation of a new antineoplastic treatment, whichever occurred first). AEs included both non-serious adverse events (AEs) and SAEs.
