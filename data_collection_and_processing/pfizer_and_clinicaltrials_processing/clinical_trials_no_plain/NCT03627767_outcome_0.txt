Study to Investigate Efficacy and Safety of PF-04965842 in Subjects Aged 12 Years and Over With Moderate to Severe Atopic Dermatitis With the Option of Rescue Treatment in Flaring Subjects
Percentage of participants with loss of response requiring rescue treatment during double blind period was determined. Loss of response denoted as flare and was define as a loss of at least 50% of EASI total score at Week 12 and with an IGA score of 2 or higher. EASI quantifies severity of participant's atopic dermatitis (AD) based on both severity of lesion clinical signs and % of body surface area (BSA) affected. EASI is a composite scoring by AD clinical evaluator of degree of erythema, induration/papulation, excoriation, and lichenification for each of 4 body regions. EASI total score range from 0.0 to 72.0, with higher scores representing greater severity of AD. IGA assesses severity of AD on 5-point scale (0 to 4, higher scores = more severity), reflecting global consideration of erythema, induration and scaling. Where, 0 = clear; 1 = almost clear; 2 = mild; 3 = moderate and 4 = severe.
