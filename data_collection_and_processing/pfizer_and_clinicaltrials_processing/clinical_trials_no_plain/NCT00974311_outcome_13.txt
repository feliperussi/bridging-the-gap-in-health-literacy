Safety and Efficacy Study of MDV3100 in Patients With Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer Who Have Been Previously Treated With Docetaxel-based Chemotherapy
Laboratory parameters included hematological and chemistry parameters. Chemistry parameters included alanine aminotransferase, albumin, alkaline phosphatase, aspartate aminotransferase, bilirubin, calcium, creatine kinase, creatinine, glucose, magnesium, phosphate, potassium and sodium. Hematology parameters included haemoglobin, leukocytes, lymphocytes, neutrophils and platelet. Test abnormalities were graded by National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) version 4.03 as Grade 3= severe and Grade 4= life-threatening or disabling. Only categories with at least 1 participant with abnormality are reported in this outcome measure. Unscheduled visit was performed at any time during the study whenever necessary to assess for or follow-up on AEs, at the participant's request or if deemed necessary by the investigator.
