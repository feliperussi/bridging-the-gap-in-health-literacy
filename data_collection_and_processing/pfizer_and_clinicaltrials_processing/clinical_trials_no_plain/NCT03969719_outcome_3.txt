A Double-blind Study to Assess 2 Doses of an Investigational Product for 16 Weeks in Participants With Non-alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease and Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus
Hypoglycemic AEs were routinely monitored during participation in the study. Hypoglycemic AE was defined as 1 of the following: 1. Asymptomatic hypoglycemia: an event not accompanied by typical symptoms of hypoglycemic AE but a plasma glucose value of <70 milligram per deciliter (mg/dL) using glucometer; 2. Documented symptomatic hypoglycemia: an event during which typical symptoms of hypoglycemic AEs were accompanied with a glucose value of <70 mg/dL using glucometer and the clinical picture included prompt resolution with food intake, subcutaneous glucagon or intravenous (IV) glucose; 3. Probable symptomatic hypoglycemia: an event during which symptoms of hypoglycemic AEs were not accompanied by a plasma glucose determination but was presumably caused by a plasma glucose concentration of <70 mg/dL, and the clinical picture included prompt resolution with food intake, subcutaneous glucagon, or IV glucose.
