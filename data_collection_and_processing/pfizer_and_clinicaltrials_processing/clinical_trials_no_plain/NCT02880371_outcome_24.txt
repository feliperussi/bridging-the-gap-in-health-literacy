A Study of ARRY-382 in Combination With Pembrolizumab for the Treatment of Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors
Different MR reported for single dose calculated at Cycle 1 Day 1 were as follows: 1) MRAUClast = ratio of AUClast values of the metabolite compared to parent, corrected for molecular weight, where AUClast was area under the plasma concentration-time curve from zero to the last measurable time point; 2) MRCmax = ratio of Cmax values of the metabolite compared to parent, corrected for molecular weight. Different MR reported for steady state calculated at Cycle 2 Day 1 were as follows: 1) MRAUCtau,ss = ratio of AUCtau,ss values of the metabolite compared to parent, corrected for molecular weight, where AUCtau was area under the plasma concentration-time curve over a dosing interval at steady-state; 2) MRCmax,ss = Ratio of Cmax,ss values of the metabolite compared to parent, corrected for molecular weight.
