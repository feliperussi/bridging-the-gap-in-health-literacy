A STUDY OF A RSV VACCINE WHEN GIVEN TOGETHER WITH TDAP IN HEALTHY NONPREGNANT WOMEN AGED BETWEEN 18 TO 49 YEARS
Assay results below the LLOQ were set to 0.5*LLOQ. Titers were expressed in terms of 1/dilution. Descriptive data for this outcome measure was planned to be collected and analyzed for combined population of participants reported under two RSV and Tdap vaccine arms: (RSV vaccine 120 mcg with Tdap and RSV vaccine 240 mcg with aluminum hydroxide/Tdap) and two RSV and placebo arm: (RSV vaccine 120 mcg with placebo and RSV vaccine 240 mcg with aluminum hydroxide with placebo) and not planned to be collected and analyzed for Placebo/Tdap arm, as pre-specified in protocol. GMRs were reported in statistical analysis section and calculated by dividing GMT of RSV vaccine with aluminum hydroxide with Tdap arm by GMT of RSV vaccine with aluminum hydroxide with placebo arm.
