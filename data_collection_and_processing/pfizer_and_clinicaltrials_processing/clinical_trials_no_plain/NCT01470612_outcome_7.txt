Long-Term Study Of CP-690,550 In Subjects With Ulcerative Colitis
Remission in participants was defined as a total Mayo score of less than or equals to (<=) 2, with no individual sub score exceeding 1 point and a rectal bleeding sub score of 0. Mayo score was an instrument designed to measure disease activity of ulcerative colitis (UC). It consisted of 4 sub scores: stool frequency, rectal bleeding, findings of flexible sigmoidoscopy and physician global assessment (PGA), each sub score graded from 0 to 3 with higher scores indicated higher disease severity. These sub scores were summed up to give a total Mayo score range of 0 to 12, where higher score indicated more severe disease.
