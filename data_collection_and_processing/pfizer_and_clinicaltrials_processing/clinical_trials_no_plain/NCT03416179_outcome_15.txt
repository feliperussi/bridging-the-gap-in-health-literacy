A Study Evaluating Intensive Chemotherapy With or Without Glasdegib or Azacitidine With or Without Glasdegib In Patients With Previously Untreated Acute Myeloid Leukemia
DoRi: only defined for participants who have ever achieved CRi or better (included CR as well) on study as the time from date of first achieving CRi or better to the date of relapse after CRi or better or death due to any cause. CRi: not qualifying for CR, neutropenia <1.0*10^9/L or platelets <100*10^9, absence of extramedullary disease, and absence of blasts with Auer rods. CR was defined based on 2017 ELN recommendations. CR: Bone marrow blasts <5 %; absence of circulating blasts and blasts with Auer rods; absence of extramedullary disease; ANC >=1.0*10^9/L; platelet count >=100*10^9/L. Participants last known to be alive who were free from relapse after CRi or better were censored at the date of last disease assessment that verifies their status.
