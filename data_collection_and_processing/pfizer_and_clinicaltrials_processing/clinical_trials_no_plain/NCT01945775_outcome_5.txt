A Study Evaluating Talazoparib (BMN 673), a PARP Inhibitor, in Advanced and/or Metastatic Breast Cancer Patients With BRCA Mutation (EMBRACA Study)
Toxicity grades were evaluated based on as National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events Version 4.03 (NCI CTCAE v4.03). NCI CTCAE v4.03 defined the severity grade as: grade 1 (mild), grade 2 (moderate), grade 3 (severe), grade 4 (potentially life threatening) and grade 5 (death related to AE) for each parameter. Key hematology parameters included hemoglobin (gram per liter [g/L]), leukocytes (10^6 cells per liter), lymphocytes (10^6 cells per liter), neutrophils (10^6 cells per liter), and platelets (10^9 cells per liter). Low value indicated lower values than the baseline values and high value indicated higher values than the baseline values. Only those categories in which at least 1 participant had data were reported.
