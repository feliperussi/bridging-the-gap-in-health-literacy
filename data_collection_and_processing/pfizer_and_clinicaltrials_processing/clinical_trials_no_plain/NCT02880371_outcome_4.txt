A Study of ARRY-382 in Combination With Pembrolizumab for the Treatment of Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors
PFS was defined as the time from the date of first dose of study drug to the earliest date of disease progression per RECIST v1.1, or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first. If a participant did not have a PFS event at the time of the analysis cut-off or at the start of any new anticancer therapy, PFS was censored at the date of last adequate tumor assessment. PD = at least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of measured lesions taking as references the smallest sum of diameters recorded on study (including baseline) and an absolute increase of >= 5 mm or appearance of at least 1 new lesion. Unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions.
