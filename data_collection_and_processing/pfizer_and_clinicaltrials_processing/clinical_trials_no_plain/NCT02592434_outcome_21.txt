Efficacy Study Of Tofacitinib In Pediatric JIA Population
JADAS-27 is a validated composite disease activity measure for JIA. JADAS-27 ESR score was derived from four components; 1) Physician global assessment of disease activity (assessed on a VAS of 0 [no activity] to 10 [maximum activity]), 2) Parent/legal guardian/subject global assessment of overall well-being (assessed on a VAS of 0 [very well] to 10 [very poor]), 3) Number of joints with active disease (maximum of 27 and defined as joint with swelling or, in absence of swelling, limited range of motion accompanied by either pain on motion or tenderness), 4) ESR. The overall JADAS-27 score ranges from 0-57. A higher score indicates more disease activity.
