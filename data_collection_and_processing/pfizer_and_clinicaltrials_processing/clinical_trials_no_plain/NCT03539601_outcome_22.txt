A Study of Crisaborole Ointment 2%; Crisaborole Vehicle; TCS and TCI in Subjects Aged â‰¥ 2 Years, With Mild-moderate AD
The CDLQI was a 10-item questionnaire that measures the impact of skin disease on children's (aged 4 to 15 years) quality of life. Each question was evaluated on a 4-point scale ranging from 0 (not at all) to 3 (very much); where higher scores indicate more impact on quality of life. The CDLQI total score was the sum of individual scores of question 1-10 and ranged from 0 (not at all) to 30 (very much): 0-1 = no effect on the child's life; 2-6 = small effect; 7-12 = moderate effect; 13-18 = very large effect; 19-30 = extremely large effect. Higher scores indicated more impact on quality of life of children.
