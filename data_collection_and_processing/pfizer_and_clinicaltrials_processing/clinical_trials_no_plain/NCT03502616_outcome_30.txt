Efficacy and Safety of Tofacitinib in Subjects With Active Ankylosing Spondylitis (AS)
The BASDAI was a validated questionnaire that consisted of 6 questions pertaining to the 5 major symptoms of ankylosing spondylitis: fatigue; spinal pain; peripheral arthritis; enthesitis, intensity of morning stiffness and duration of morning stiffness. Each question was rated using a numerical rating scale from 0 (none) to 10 (very severe), higher score=high disease activity. The BASDAI score was calculated by computing the mean of questions 5 and 6 and adding it to the sum of questions 1 to 4. This score was then divided by 5. The total BASDAI score was ranged from 0= none to 10= very severe, where higher score indicated high disease activity.
