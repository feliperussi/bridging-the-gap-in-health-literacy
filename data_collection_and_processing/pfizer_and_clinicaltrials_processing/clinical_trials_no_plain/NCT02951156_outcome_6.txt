TTR was defined for participants who achieved objective response as time from randomization to first documentation of objective tumor response (CR or PR) that was subsequently confirmed. CR was defined as a score of 1 (no uptake above background), 2 (uptake <= mediastinum), or 3 (uptake <mediastinum but <=liver) with or without a residual mass on PET 5-PS, for lymph nodes and extralymphatic sites; no new lesions; no evidence of FDG-avid disease in bone marrow. PR was defined as >=50% decrease in SPD of up to six of the largest dominant lymph nodes, no increase in size of other nodes, liver, or spleen volume, a >=50% decrease in SPD of hepatic and splenic nodules, absence of other organ involvement, and no new sites of disease.
