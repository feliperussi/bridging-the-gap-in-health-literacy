Safety Study Of Tofacitinib Versus Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF) Inhibitor In Subjects With Rheumatoid Arthritis
HAQ-DI assesses the degree of difficulty a participant has experienced during the past week in 8 domains of daily living activities: dressing/grooming; arising; eating; walking; reach; grip; hygiene; and other activities. There were total of 30 items distributed in these 8 domains. Each item was scored on a 4-point scale from 0 to 3: 0= no difficulty; 1= some difficulty; 2= much difficulty; 3= unable to do. Overall score was computed as the sum of domain scores and divided by the number of domains answered. Total possible score range 0 (least difficulty) and 3 (extreme difficulty), where higher scores indicate more difficulty while performing daily living activities.
