Participants with urothelial transitional cell cancer (TCC), triple negative breast cancer (TNBC), NSCLC or ovarian cancer (OC) that were candidates to treatment with a cisplatin-based combination. Each treatment cycle was defined as 21 days. Participants received intravenous infusion of PF-05212384 90 mg once on Day -7 and Cycle 1 Day 2, and cisplatin 75 mg/m2 2-hour IV infusion once on Cycle 1 Day 1. On Day 1 for Cycles 2 and beyond, participants received cisplatin 75 mg/m2 2-hour IV infusion once followed by PF-05212384 90 mg once. The maximum duration of PF-05212384 treatment was 414 days and the maximum duration of cisplatin treatment was 157 days.
