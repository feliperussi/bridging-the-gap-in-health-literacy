Study to Investigate Efficacy and Safety of PF-04965842 in Subjects Aged 12 Years and Over With Moderate to Severe Atopic Dermatitis With the Option of Rescue Treatment in Flaring Subjects
Time (in days) to loss of response based on achieving IGA >=2 (for the first time) as measured from date of first dose of randomized treatment until the last dose of randomized treatment (if not entered rescue) or first day of rescue treatment (if entered rescue). IGA assesses severity of AD on a 5-point scale (0 to 4, higher scores indicated more severity), reflecting global consideration of erythema, induration and scaling. Where, 0 = clear, AD is cleared; 1 = almost clear, AD not entirely cleared, light pink residual lesions; 2 = mild, AD with light red lesions; 3 = moderate, AD with red lesions; 4 = severe, AD with deep, dark red lesions.
