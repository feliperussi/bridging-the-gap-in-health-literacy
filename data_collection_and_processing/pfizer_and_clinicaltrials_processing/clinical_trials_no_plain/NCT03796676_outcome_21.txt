JAK1 Inhibitor With Medicated Topical Therapy in Adolescents With Atopic Dermatitis
SCORAD is a validated scoring index for AD, which combines extent (A, 0-100), severity (B, 0-18), and subjective symptoms (C, 0-20) based on pruritus and sleep loss, each scored (0-10). The SCORAD for an individual is calculated by the formula: A/5 + 7B/2 + C (can range from 0 to 103). Subjective symptoms (ie, itch and sleep loss) are each scored by the participant using a VAS where "0" is no itch (or no sleep loss) and "10" is the worst imaginable itch (or sleep loss). The value for each should reflect the average on a 10 point scale for the last 3 days/nights. Changes from baseline in SCORAD subjective assessments of itch were not evaluated. Only changes from baseline in SCORAD subjective assessments of sleep loss are presented below.
