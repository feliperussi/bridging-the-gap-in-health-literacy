A Study to Evaluate Safety and Efficacy of PF-06826647 For Moderate To Severe Plaque Psoriasis
The PGA of psoriasis is scored on a 5-point scale, reflecting a global consideration of the erythema, induration, and scaling across all psoriatic lesions. Average erythema, induration, and scaling are scored separately over the whole body according to a 5-point severity scale (0 [no symptom] to 4 [severe symptom]). The total score was calculated as average of the 3 severity scores and rounded to the nearest whole number score to determine the PGA score and category (0=clear; 1=almost clear; 2=mild; 3=moderate; and 4=severe). PGA response was defined as 0 (clear) or 1 (almost clear). The statistical analysis was for the data at Week 16.
