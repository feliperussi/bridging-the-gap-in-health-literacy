Patient Perception of Treatment Burden in Weekly Versus Daily Growth Hormone Injections in Children With GHD
This is an open label randomized 24 week crossover trial assessing the treatment burden of a weekly growth hormone injection regimen (somatrogon) compared to a daily growth hormone injection regimen (Genotropin). Approximately 90 children with growth hormone deficiency who have been stable on treatment with daily Genotropin will be enrolled.
