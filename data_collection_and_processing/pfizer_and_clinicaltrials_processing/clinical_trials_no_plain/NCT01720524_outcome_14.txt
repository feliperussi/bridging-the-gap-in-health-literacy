A Study To Evaluate Safety And Efficacy Of IV Sildenafil In The Treatment Of Neonates With Persistent Pulmonary Hypertension Of The Newborn
Bayley-III assesses infant and toddler development across five domains: cognitive, language, motor, social-emotional (SE), and adaptive behavior (AB). Assessments of the cognitive, language, and motor domains conducted using items administered to the child; assessments of the SE and AB domains conducted using the primary caregiver's responses to a questionnaire. Score ranges: cognitive scale 0-91, language scale 0-97 and motor scale 0-132, where higher scores indicated better cognitive function, communication and motor skills respectively. Raw scores of cognitive, language and motor domains were converted to composite scores. Composite scores of cognitive, language and motor developmental scales ranged from a scale of 40 to 160, where higher score indicated stronger skills and abilities. In this outcome measure composite scores for infants and toddlers were reported at month 12 and 24.
