A Study Of Palbociclib (PD-0332991) + Letrozole VS. Placebo+ Letrozole For 1st Line Treatment Of Asian Postmenopausal Women With ER+/HER2- Advanced Breast Cancer [PALOMA-4]
PFS was based on Kaplan-Meier estimates. PFS was defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of the first documentation of objective progression of disease (PD) or death due to any cause in the absence of documented PD, whichever occurred first. PD is defined using Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.1) as a 20% increase in the sum of of diameters of target measurable lesions above the smallest sum observed (over baseline if no decrease in the sum is observed during therapy), with a minimum absolute increase of 5 mm. In this outcome measure, PFS was based on investigator's assessment.
