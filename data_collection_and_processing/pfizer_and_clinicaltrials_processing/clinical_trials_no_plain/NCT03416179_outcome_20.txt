A Study Evaluating Intensive Chemotherapy With or Without Glasdegib or Azacitidine With or Without Glasdegib In Patients With Previously Untreated Acute Myeloid Leukemia
MDASI-AML/MDS: consists of 23 items, 13-item core cancer symptoms (pain, fatigue, nausea, disturbed sleep, distress, shortness of breath, problem remembering, lack of appetite, drowsiness, dry mouth, sadness, vomiting, and numbness), 4-item AML/MDS specific symptoms (malaise, diarrhea, muscle weakness, and skin problems), and 6 areas of interference (general activity, mood, work, walking, relations with other people, and enjoyment of life). The 13 core symptoms and 6 core interference items had highest frequency and/or severity in participants with various cancers and treatment types. It was measured at severity of symptoms and related interference at their worst level in last 24 hours by asking participants to respond to each item on an 0-10 NRS, where 0 = "not present" or "did not interfere" and 10 = "worst" or "interfered completely".
