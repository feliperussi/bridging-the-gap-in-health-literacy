Safety Study Of Tofacitinib Versus Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF) Inhibitor In Subjects With Rheumatoid Arthritis
DAS28 is a measure of disease activity in participants with rheumatoid arthritis based on a 28-joint assessment. DAS28-4 (CRP) was calculated from number of painful joints out of 28 joints (TJC28) and number of swollen joints out of 28 joints (SJC28), CRP (mg/L) and PtGA on a 100 mm VAS (VAS: scores ranging from 0 mm [very well] to 100 mm [worst], higher scores indicated worse health condition). Total DAS28-4 (CRP) score range: 0 to 9.4, higher score indicated more disease activity. DAS28-4 (CRP) <= 3.2 indicates low disease activity and > 3.2 to <=5.1 indicates moderate disease activity, >5.1 indicates high disease activity, and DAS28-4 (CRP) < 2.6 indicates remission. DAS28-4 (CRP) = 0.56*sqrt(TJC28) + 0.28*sqrt(SJC28) + 0.36*ln(CRP in mg/L +1) + 0.014*PtGA in mm+ 0.96.
