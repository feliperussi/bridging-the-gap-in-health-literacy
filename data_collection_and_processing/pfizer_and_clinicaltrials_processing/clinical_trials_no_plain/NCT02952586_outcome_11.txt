EQ-5D-5L is a standardized participant completed questionnaire that measures health status in terms of a single index value or utility score. EQ-5D-5L consisted of two components: a health state profile (descriptive system) and a visual analogue scale (VAS) in which participants rate their overall health status from 0 (worst imaginable) to 100 (best imaginable), where higher scores indicated better health status. EQ-5D health state profile is comprised of 5 dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. Each dimension has 5 response levels: 1=no problems, 2=slight problems, 3=moderate problems, 4=severe problems and 5=extreme problems. EQ-5D-5L health status index score range between 0 to 1.
