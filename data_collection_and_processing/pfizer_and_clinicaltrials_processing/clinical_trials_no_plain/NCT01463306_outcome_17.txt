A 12-Month Study To Evaluate The Safety And Tolerability Of Pregabalin As Add-On Therapy In Pediatric Subjects 1 Month To 16 Years Of Age With Partial Onset Seizures And Pediatric And Adult Subjects 5 To 65 Years Of Age With Primary Generalized Tonic-Clonic Seizures
CogState brief battery consisted of 2 tasks-detection and pediatric identification task using a laptop computer with external response buttons. Prior tasks, participants were briefed rules, given an interactive demonstration and a sufficient number of practice trials. For each task, participant responded "yes" using a response button with dominant hand. Participants had to "respond as fast and as accurately as possible." Pediatric identification task: measured choice reaction time to assess visual attention. An event (a card turning face up) occurred in center of computer screen and participant decided if event met a predefined and unchanging criterion (is the color of the card black?); answered "YES" if criterion was met. A participant's RCI was calculated by dividing the change from individual baseline score by ([square root 2] times WSD),WSD=within-subject standard deviation from Cogstate task normative data. Improvement in cognition: RCI <=-1.65, decline in cognition: RCI =>1.65.
