Crisaborole Ointment 2% Skin Biomarker Biopsy Study in Atopic Dermatitis
AE was any untoward medical occurrence in a participant who received study drug without regard to possibility of causal relationship. SAE was an AE resulting in any of the following outcomes or deemed significant for any other reason: death; life-threatening (immediate risk of death); initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; persistent or significant disability/incapacity; congenital anomaly/birth defect. AEs included both SAEs and non-serious AEs. Treatment-emergent AEs were those with initial onset or increasing in severity on or after the first dose of study treatment. Each participant received both crisaborole (for one target lesion) and vehicle (for the other target lesion) on the same days during double-blind period, and only crisaborole during open-label period; therefore AEs were reported for each treatment group for participants to capture all AEs, instead of each treatment for treated area as it only captures AEs occurred at treated areas (see next Outcome Measure).
