Talazoparib For Neoadjuvant Treatment Of Germline BRCA1/2 Mutation Patients With Early Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2 Negative Breast Cancer
EORTC QLQ-C30 is a 30-item cancer-specific instrument that assesses participant reported outcomes, consisting of 5 functional scales, 3 symptoms scales, a GHS/QoL scale, and 6 single-item scales. The GHS/QoL scale has 7 possible scores of responses (1=very poor to 7=excellent). All other items have 4 possible scores (1=not at all to 4=very much). A linear transformation was applied to the raw scores so that all transformed scores lie between 0 to 100, with 0 being the worst and 100 being the best for GHS/QoL and functional scales, and 0 being the best and 100 being the worst for symptoms scales. For the nausea and vomiting symptoms scale, participants self-rated how much they had felt nauseated and/or vomited during the past week. A 10 point change from baseline was used to indicate clinically meaningful change. No change in nausea/vomiting symptoms=having neither deterioration (≥10 point increase from baseline) nor improvement (≥10 point decrease from baseline) for the time point.
