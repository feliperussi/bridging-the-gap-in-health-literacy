A Phase 3 Study to Evaluate the Safety, Tolerability, and Immunogenicity of Multiple Production Lots and Dose Levels of BNT162b2 RNA-Based COVID-19 Vaccines Against COVID-19 in Healthy Participants
This is a Phase 3, randomized, observer-blind study in healthy individuals.

The primary study will evaluate the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of the SARS-CoV-2 RNA vaccine candidate (BNT162b2):

As a 30-microgram dose, administered from 1 of 4 manufacturing lots (batches)
As a 20-microgram dose, administered from 1 of the manufacturing lots
As a 2-dose (separated by 21 days) schedule
In people 12 through 50 years of age

The booster study will evaluate the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of 2 SARS-CoV-2 RNA vaccine candidates (BNT162b2 and BNT162b2.B.1.351):

Each as a 30-microgram dose
Each as a 1-dose booster vaccine, administered approximately 3 months after Dose 2
In people 18 through 50 years of age
