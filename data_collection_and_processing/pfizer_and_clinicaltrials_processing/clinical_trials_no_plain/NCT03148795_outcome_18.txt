The EQ-5D VAS is a 20 cm vertical scale where patients can mark from 0 (worst health imaginable) to 100 (best health imaginable). Overall scores range from 0 to 1, with low scores representing a higher level of dysfunction. Analysis is not final for this outcome measure at PCD, complete data will be posted at SCD.
