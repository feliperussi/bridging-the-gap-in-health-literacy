A STUDY OF A RSV VACCINE WHEN GIVEN TOGETHER WITH TDAP IN HEALTHY NONPREGNANT WOMEN AGED BETWEEN 18 TO 49 YEARS
Percentage of participants achieving Anti-TTd antibody concentrations of >= 0.1 IU/mL at 1 month after vaccination were reported. The lower limit of quantitation (LLOQ) values for Anti-TTd was 0.05 IU/mL. Assay results below the LLOQ were set to 0.5*LLOQ. Data for this outcome measure was planned to be collected and analyzed only for combined population of participants reported under two RSV vaccine arms: (RSV vaccine 120 mcg with Tdap and RSV vaccine 240 mcg with aluminum hydroxide/Tdap) along with placebo/Tdap arm and not planned to be collected and analyzed for two RSV vaccine arms: (RSV vaccine 120 mcg with placebo and RSV vaccine 240 mcg with aluminum hydroxide with placebo), as pre-specified in protocol.
