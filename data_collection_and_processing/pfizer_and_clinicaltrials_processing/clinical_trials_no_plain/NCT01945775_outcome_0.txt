A Study Evaluating Talazoparib (BMN 673), a PARP Inhibitor, in Advanced and/or Metastatic Breast Cancer Patients With BRCA Mutation (EMBRACA Study)
IRF assessed PFS was defined as time (in months) from randomization until the date of first documented radiologic progressive disease per response evaluation criteria in solid tumors (RECIST) version 1.1 or death from any cause, whichever occurs first. As per RECIST v1.1, progression defined as 1) for target lesions: at least a 20% increase in the sum of target lesion measurements, compared to the smallest sum on study (including baseline), the absolute increase in the sum has to be at least 5 millimeter (mm); 2) for non-target lesions: unequivocal progression of non-target lesions, evaluated as a whole, such that it is clear that treatment has failed and disease is progressing, regardless of the status of the target lesions; 3) and/or appearance of one or more new lesions. The analysis was performed by Kaplan-Meier method.
