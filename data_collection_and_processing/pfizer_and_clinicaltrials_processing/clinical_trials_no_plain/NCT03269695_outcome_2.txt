Efficacy, Safety and Tolerability of PF-06687234 as Add-on Therapy to Infliximab in Active UC Subjects Not in Remission.
The Mayo score consists of 4 subscores (Endoscopic, stool frequency, rectal bleeding and Physician's global assessment), each graded 0 to 3 with the higher score indicating more severe disease activity. Modified clinical remission is defined as a modified total Mayo Score (total Mayo score excluding the PGA subscore) with endoscopic subscore = 0 or 1 (where any friability was scored as a mayo endoscopic subscore of 2), stool frequency subscore = 0 or 1, and rectal bleeding subscore = 0. Participants with missing values were handled by observed case approach (the missing data were used as is). The percentage of participants achieving modified clinical remission was calculated based on the number of participants with observed data.
