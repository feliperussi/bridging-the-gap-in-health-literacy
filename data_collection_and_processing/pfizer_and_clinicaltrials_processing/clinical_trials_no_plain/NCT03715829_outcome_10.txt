A Phase 2b Study To Evaluate The Efficacy And Safety Profile Of PF-06651600 And PF-06700841 In Active Non-segmental Vitiligo Subjects
T-VASI was calculated by a formula that included contribution from 6 body regions (possible range, 0-100): T-VASI = Ʃ [Hand Units] × [Depigmentation]. One hand unit, which encompassed the palm plus the volar surface of all the digits, was approximately 1% of the total body surface area and was used as a guide to estimate the baseline percentage of vitiligo involvement of each body region. The body was divided into 6 mutually exclusive regions: face/neck, hands, upper extremities, trunk, lower extremities, and feet. The extent of depigmentation was expressed by the percentages: 0, 10%, 25%, 50%, 75%, 90% or 100%. The outcome measure was the percentage of participants achieving at least 90% improvement from baseline in T-VASI (T-VASI90). Percent change from baseline in T-VASI=((post-baseline T-VASI - baseline T-VASI)/baseline T-VASI)×100. Negative percent change from baseline in T-VASI signified an improvement. Baseline was defined as the last measurement prior to first dosing (Day 1).
