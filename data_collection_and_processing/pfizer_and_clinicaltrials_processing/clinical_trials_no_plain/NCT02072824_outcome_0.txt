A Safety, Efficacy, and Tolerability Trial of Pregabalin as Add-On Treatment in Pediatric Subjects <4 Years of Age With Partial Onset Seizures.
All partial onset seizures experienced during treatment phase were recorded by central reader during the 48 to 72 hour video-electroencephalogram (EEG). Double Blind 24 hour EEG seizure rate for all partial onset seizures = ([Number of seizures in double blind 48 to 72 hour EEG assessment] divided by [number of hours of video-EEG monitoring])*24. The EEG assessment was done at the end of the fixed dose treatment. For log-transformation, the quantity 1 was added to the double blind 24 hour EEG seizure rate for all participants to account for any possible "0" seizure incidence. This resulted in final calculation as: log transformed (double-blind 24-hour EEG seizure rate + 1).
