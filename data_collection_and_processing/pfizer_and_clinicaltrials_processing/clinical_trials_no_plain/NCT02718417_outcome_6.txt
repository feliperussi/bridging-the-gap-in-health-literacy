Avelumab in Previously Untreated Patients With Epithelial Ovarian Cancer (JAVELIN OVARIAN 100)
BICR assessed DOR: time (in months) from the first documentation of objective response (confirmed CR or PR) to the date of first documentation of PD or death due to any cause. As per RECIST version 1.1, CR was defined as disappearance of all target and non-target lesions, and sustained for at least 4 weeks. Any pathological lymph nodes (target or non-target) must have reduction in short axis to <10 mm. PR: at least 30% decrease in the sum of the longest dimensions of target lesions taking as reference the baseline sum longest dimensions. PD was defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this included the baseline sum if that is the smallest on study). In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must have also demonstrated an absolute increase of at least 5 mm. The appearance of one or more new lesions was also considered progression. Analysis was performed using Kaplan-Meier method.
