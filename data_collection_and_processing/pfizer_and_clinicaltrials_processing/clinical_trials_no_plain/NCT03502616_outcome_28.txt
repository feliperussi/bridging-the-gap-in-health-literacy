Efficacy and Safety of Tofacitinib in Subjects With Active Ankylosing Spondylitis (AS)
ASAS 5/6 consists of 6 domains: 4 used in ASAS20 - PGA (assess disease activity on a scale of 0 [not active] to 10 [very active], higher score=more disease activity), Spinal Pain (total back pain) (on a scale of 0 [no pain] to 10 [most severe pain], higher score=more severity), Function (using BASFI which assess participant's level of ability on a scale of 0 [easy] to 10 [impossible], lower scores= better functional health) and Inflammation (using BASDAI, mean of Q 5 and 6, which assess disease activity on a scale of 0 [none] to 10 [severe], higher score=more disease activity), CRP (was measured in mg per liter) and Spinal mobility was measured in centimeter and calculated as mean of right and left measurements of lateral spinal flexion from BASMI. ASAS 5/6: defined as >=20% improvement in at least 5 domains.
