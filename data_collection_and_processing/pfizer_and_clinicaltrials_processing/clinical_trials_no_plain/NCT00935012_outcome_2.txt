Safety And Efficacy Evaluation Of Fx-1006a In Patients With V122i Or Wild-Type Transthyretin (TTR) Amyloid Cardiomyopathy
NYHA classified participants in 4 classes. Class I included participants with cardiac disease without limitations of physical activity. Ordinary physical activity did not cause undue fatigue, palpitation, dyspnea, or anginal pain. Class II included participants with cardiac disease with slight limitation of physical activity. They were comfortable at rest. Ordinary physical activity resulted in fatigue, palpitation, dyspnea, or anginal pain. Class III included participants with cardiac disease with marked limitation of physical activity. They were comfortable at rest. Less than ordinary physical activity caused fatigue, palpitation, dyspnea, or anginal pain. Class IV included participants with cardiac disease with the inability to carry on any physical activity without discomfort. Symptoms of cardiac insufficiency or of the anginal syndrome might be present even at rest. If any physical activity was undertaken, discomfort was increased.
