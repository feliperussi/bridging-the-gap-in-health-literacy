Safety and Efficacy Study of Enzalutamide Versus Bicalutamide in Men With Prostate Cancer
The FACT-P is a multidimensional, self-reported quality of life instrument consisting of 27 core items that assess patient function in 4 domains: physical, social/family, emotional, and functional well-being, and supplemented by 12 site-specific items to assess for prostate-related symptoms. Each item is rated on a 0 to 4 Likert-type scale, and then combined to produce subscale scores for each domain, as well as a global quality of life score (0 to 156) with higher scores representing better quality of life. Time to degradation of FACT-P was defined as the time from randomization to first assessment with at least a 10-point decrease from baseline in the global FACT-P score for each participant. Participants with no score degradation at the time of analysis data cutoff were censored at the date of last assessment showing no degradation.
