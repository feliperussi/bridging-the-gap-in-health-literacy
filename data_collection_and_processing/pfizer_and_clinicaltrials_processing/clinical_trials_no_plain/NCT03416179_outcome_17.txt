A Study Evaluating Intensive Chemotherapy With or Without Glasdegib or Azacitidine With or Without Glasdegib In Patients With Previously Untreated Acute Myeloid Leukemia
TTRi:Participants who achieved CRi or better, as the time from date of randomization to first documentation of response(CRi or better).TTRh:Participants who achieved CRh or better, as the time from date of randomization to first documentation of response(CRh or better). CRi:not qualifying for CR, neutrophil<0.5*10^9/L or platelets<50*10^9, absence of extramedullary disease,absence of blasts with Auer rods. CR was defined based on 2017 ELN recommendations. CR: Bone marrow blasts <5 %; absence of circulating blasts and blasts with Auer rods; absence of extramedullary disease; ANC >=1.0*10^9/L; platelet count >=100*10^9/L. CRh: MRD (positive or unknown); bone marrow blasts <5%; assessed in non-intensive chemotherapy study only, not qualifying for CR, ie, both neutrophil >=0.5*10^9/L and platelets >=50*10^9/L must be met, but does not satisfy both neutrophils >=1*10^9/L and platelets >=100*10^9/L at the same time; absence of extramedullary disease; and absence of blasts with Auer rods.
