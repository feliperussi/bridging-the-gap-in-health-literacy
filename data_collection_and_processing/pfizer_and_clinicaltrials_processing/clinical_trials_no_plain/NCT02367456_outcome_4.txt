RR (Percentage of participants achieving CR+PR among all the enrolled and treated patients as defined by modified International Working Group (IWG) criteria (2006)) in the LIC. CR was defined as having responses of hemoglobin ≥11 g/dL, neutrophils ≥1 x 10^9/L, platelets ≥1 x 10^11/L, percentage of blasts = 0%, percentage of BMB≤5%, and normal maturation of all cell lines (note if has persistent dysplasia), and all responses must last at least 4 weeks. PR was defined as meeting all CR criteria if abnormal before treatment except BMB, percentage of BMB decreased by ≥50% but still >5% for at least 4 weeks.
