Study to Investigate Efficacy and Safety of PF-04965842 in Subjects Aged 12 Years and Over With Moderate to Severe Atopic Dermatitis With the Option of Rescue Treatment in Flaring Subjects
Time (in days) to loss of response based on achieving IGA >=2 was measured from date of first dose of randomized treatment until last dose of randomized treatment (if not entered rescue) or first day of rescue treatment (if entered rescue) and based on EASI, loss of at least 50% of EASI response at Week 12 and IGA score of 2 or higher. IGA assesses severity of AD on 5-point scale (0 to 4, higher scores=more severity), reflecting global consideration of erythema, induration and scaling with scores 0 = clear; 1 = almost clear; 2 = mild; 3 = moderate; 4 = severe. EASI quantifies severity of AD based on severity of lesion clinical signs and % of BSA affected. EASI composite score evaluates degree of erythema, induration/papulation, excoriation, and lichenification.
