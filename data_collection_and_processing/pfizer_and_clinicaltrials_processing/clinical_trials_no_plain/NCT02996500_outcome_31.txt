Safety and Efficacy of Pf-06650833 In Subjects With Rheumatoid Arthritis, With An Inadequate Response To Methotrexate
The SF 36 version 2 (acute) is a 36 item generic health status measure. It measures 8 general health domains. These domains can also be summarized as physical component score (PCS) and mental component score (MCS). The PCS and MCS summary scores range from 0-100, with higher scores representing better self-reported health. The lower the score the more disability. This was performed early in the clinic visit and before the participant had extensive contact with site personnel and/or Investigator. Tofacitinib was included in this study as an active control. The efficacy endpoint for the tofatinicib arm was an exploratory endpoint and neither primary nor secondary endpoints.
