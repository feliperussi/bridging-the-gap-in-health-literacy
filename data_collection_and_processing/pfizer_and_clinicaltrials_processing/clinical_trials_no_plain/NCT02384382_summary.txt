A Positron Emission Tomography/Computed Tomography (PET/CT) Bone Imaging Study in Patients Receiving Enzalutamide for Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer (CRPC)
The purpose of this study is to evaluate 18F-sodium fluoride positron-emission tomography / computed tomography (18F-NaF PET/CT) imaging as a method for determining treatment response in metastatic bone lesions in patients who are receiving enzalutamide for castration-resistant prostate cancer.
