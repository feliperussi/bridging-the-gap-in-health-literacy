ORR was defined as percentage of participants with confirmed objective response (OR) of complete response (CR) and partial response (PR) based on RECIST version 1.1. CR was defined as complete disappearance of all target lesions with the exception of nodal disease. All target nodes must decrease to normal size (short axis < 10 mm). All target lesions must be assessed. PR was defined as >= 30% decrease under baseline of the sum of diameters of all target measurable lesions. The short diameter was used in the sum for target nodes, while the longest diameter was used in the sum for all other target lesions. All target lesions must be assessed.
