Efficacy And Safety Of Tofacitinib In Psoriatic Arthritis: Comparator Study
The SF-36v2 acute is a 36-item measure that evaluates 8 domains: physical functioning, role physical, bodily pain, general health, vitality, social functioning, role-emotional, and mental health. An additional item measures health transition. The 8 health domains are aggregated into two summary scores known as the physical component summary (PCS) score and the mental component summary (MCS) score. Norm-based domain scores, PCS and MCS scores are used in the analyses; each of which has a population mean of 50 with a standard deviation (SD) of 10 points, and ranges from minus infinity to plus infinity. A higher PCS score represents better physical health status.
