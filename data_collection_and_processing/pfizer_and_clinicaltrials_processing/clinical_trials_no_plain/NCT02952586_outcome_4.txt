Study To Compare Avelumab In Combination With Standard of Care Chemoradiotherapy (SoC CRT) Versus SoC CRT for Definitive Treatment In Patients With Locally Advanced Squamous Cell Carcinoma Of The Head And Neck (JAVELIN HEAD AND NECK 100)
Objective response (OR) was defined as a complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) per RECIST v1.1 recorded from randomization until disease progression per modified RECIST v1.1 or death due to any cause. A participant was considered to have achieved an OR if the participant had a CR or PR which did not need to be confirmed at a subsequent assessment. CR for target disease: complete disappearance of all target lesions with the exception of nodal disease. All target nodes must decrease to normal size (short axis less than [<] 10 millimeter [mm]). CR for non-target disease: disappearance of all non-target lesions and normalization of tumor marker levels. All lymph nodes must be 'normal' in size (<10 mm short axis) . PR: Greater than or equal to (>=) 30% decrease under baseline of the sum of diameters of all target measurable lesions. The ORR was estimated by dividing the number of participants with OR (CR or PR) by the number of participants randomized.
