A Multicenter Phase 3, Open-Label Study of Bosutinib Versus Imatinib in Adult Patients With Newly Diagnosed Chronic Phase Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia
The Kaplan-Meier curve was generated based on the first date of MMR until the date of the confirmed loss of MMR or censoring, objectively documented, for responders only. Confirmed loss of MMR was BCR-ABL/ABL IS ratio >0.1% in association with a >=5-fold increase in BCR-ABL/ABL IS ratio from the lowest value achieved up to that time-point confirmed by a second assessment at least 28 days later. Treatment discontinuation due to suboptimal response/treatment failure, progressive disease (PD) or death due to PD within 28 days of last dose were considered confirmed loss of MMR. PD was defined as disease progression to accelerated phase (AP) or blast phase (BP) CML.
