JAK1 Inhibitor With Medicated Topical Therapy in Adolescents With Atopic Dermatitis
The immunogenicity analysis was to evaluate the effect of abrocitinib on immunogenicity to a tetanus, diphtheria and pertussis combination vaccine (Tdap) vaccine in adolescent participants 12 to <18 years of age with moderate to severe AD. Participants who completed 8 weeks of treatment with study intervention received Tdap at Week 8, and had blood samples collected for the evaluation of immunogenicity to the vaccine at Weeks 8 and 12. The fold increase was defined as the ratio (post-vaccination: pre-vaccination) of concentration values. The geometric mean fold rise (GMFR) is presented below, and was calculated by first arithmetically averaging the logarithmically transformed ratio (post-vaccination: pre-vaccination) values, and then back transformation. A 95% CI for GMFR was constructed by back transformation of the CI for the logarithmically transformed GMFRs computed using the Student's t distribution.
