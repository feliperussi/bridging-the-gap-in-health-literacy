Study To Evaluate Safety And Efficacy Of PF-06700841 In Subjects With Moderate To Severe Plaque Psoriasis
ECG categorical summarization criteria: 1) QRS duration (time from ECG Q wave to the end of the S wave corresponding to ventricle depolarization): >=140 milliseconds (msec), >=50% change from baseline; 2) PR interval (the interval between the start of the P wave and the start of the QRS complex, corresponding to the time between the onset of the atrial depolarization and onset of ventricular depolarization): >=300 msec, >=25% change when baseline is > 200 msec or >=50% change when baseline is less than or equal to (<=) 200 msec; 3) QT interval (time from ECG Q wave to the end of the T wave corresponding to electrical systole): absolute value of >=500 msec; 4) QTc interval (QT corrected for heart rate): absolute value of 450 to <480 msec, 480 to <500 msec, >=500 msec; a change from baseline of 30 to <60 msec or >=60 msec.
