A Study of Avelumab, Binimetinib and Talazoparib in Patients With Locally Advanced or Metastatic RAS-mutant Solid Tumors
OR is defined as complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) according to RECIST v1.1 from the 'start date' (date of first study treatment) until the date of the first documentation of progressive disease (PD). CR was defined as complete disappearance of all target and non-target lesions, with the exception of nodal disease and sustained for at least 4 weeks. PR was defined as at least 30% decrease in the sum of the longest dimensions of target lesions taking as reference the baseline sum longest dimensions. PD was defined as unequivocal progression of pre-existing lesions and if overall tumor burden increased sufficiently to merit discontinuation of therapy. Both CR and PR must be confirmed by repeat assessments performed no less than 4 weeks after the criteria for response are first met. Clopper-Pearson method was used.
