A Comparative Study Of PF-06439535 Plus Paclitaxel-Carboplatin And Bevacizumab Plus Paclitaxel-Carboplatin Patients With Advanced Non-Squamous NSCLC
ORR refers to percentage of participants who achieved complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) by Week 19 of the study in accordance with Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v 1.1 which was subsequently confirmed by Week 25. A participant achieved CR if both target and non-target lesions achieved CR, no new lesions; achieved PR if target lesions achieved CR or PR, non-target lesions were assessed as non-CR/non-PD (progressive disease), indeterminate or missing, and no new lesions. For target lesions, CR: complete disappearance of all target lesions except nodal disease (target nodes must decrease to normal size); PR: >= 30% decrease under baseline of the sum of diameters of all target measurable lesions. For non-target lesions, CR: disappearance of all non-target lesions and normalization of tumor marker levels and all lymph nodes must be normal in size; non-CR/non-PD: persistence of any non-target lesions and/or tumor marker level above the normal limits.
