A Phase 2 Study to Evaluate the Safety, Efficacy, Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics of PF-06252616 in Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy
The NSAA is a 17-item test that measured gross motor function. A total score could range from 0 to 34 (fully-independent function). MMRM was used to analyze the change from baseline on NSAA for the natural history control group compared to placebo group (Sequence 3). This MMRM was established to assess the appropriateness on the using natural history control group as a comparator. The natural history control group was established by filtering the CINRG natural history database. Participants who met the following requirements at baseline and had evaluable NSAA data on Week 49 were included in this group: 1) age: 6 to <16 years; 2)treatment of glucocorticoid steroids >=6 months prior to baseline and continuous use until the latest visit week; 3) 4SC: 2-15.9 seconds; 4) participants who were ambulatory at baseline; 5) LVEF: >=55% or missing.
