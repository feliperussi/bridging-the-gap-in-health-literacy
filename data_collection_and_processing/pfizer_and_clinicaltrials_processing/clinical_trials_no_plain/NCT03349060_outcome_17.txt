Study to Evaluate Efficacy and Safety of PF-04965842 in Subjects Aged 12 Years And Older With Moderate to Severe Atopic Dermatitis
SCORAD: scoring index for AD combining extent, severity, subjective symptoms. Extent (A): rule of 9 was used to calculate BSA affected by AD as a % of whole BSA for each body region- head and neck 9%; upper limbs 9% each; lower limbs 18% each; anterior trunk 18%; back 18%; 1% for genitals. The score for each body region was added to determine A (0-100). Severity (B): severity of each sign (erythema; edema; oozing; excoriation; skin thickening; dryness) was assessed as none (0), mild (1), moderate (2) or severe (3). The severity scores added to give B (0-18). Subjective symptoms (C): pruritus and sleep loss, each of these 2 were scored by participant/caregiver using VAS where "0" = no itch or no sleeplessness and "10" = the worst imaginable itch or sleeplessness, higher scores worse symptoms. Scores for itch and sleeplessness added to give 'C' (0-20). The SCORAD for an individual was calculated: A/5 + 7*B/2 + C; range from 0 to 103; higher values of SCORAD = worse outcome.
