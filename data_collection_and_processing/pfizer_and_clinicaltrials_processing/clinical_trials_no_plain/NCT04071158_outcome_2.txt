A STUDY OF A RSV VACCINE WHEN GIVEN TOGETHER WITH TDAP IN HEALTHY NONPREGNANT WOMEN AGED BETWEEN 18 TO 49 YEARS
GMCs of anti-pertussis components: anti pertussis (anti-PT) toxin, anti filamentous hemagglutinin (FHA) and anti- pertactin (PRN) was measured and reported in descriptive section. LLOQ values for each component was: Anti-PT=0.9 endotoxin units per milliliter (EU/mL), Anti-FHA=2.9 EU/mL, and Anti-PRN=3.0 EU/mL. Assay results below LLOQ were set to 0.5*LLOQ. Descriptive data for this outcome measure was planned to be collected and analyzed only for combined population of participants reported under two RSV vaccine arms: (RSV vaccine 120 mcg with Tdap and RSV vaccine 240 mcg with aluminum hydroxide/Tdap) along with placebo/Tdap arm and not planned to be collected and analyzed for two RSV vaccine arms: (RSV vaccine 120 mcg with placebo and RSV vaccine 240 mcg with aluminum hydroxide with placebo), as pre-specified in protocol. GMRs were reported in statistical analysis section and calculated by dividing GMC of RSV vaccine with aluminum hydroxide with Tdap arm by GMC of placebo/Tdap arm.
