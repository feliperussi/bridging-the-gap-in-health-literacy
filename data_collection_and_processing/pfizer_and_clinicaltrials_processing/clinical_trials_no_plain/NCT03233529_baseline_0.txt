Crisaborole Ointment 2% Skin Biomarker Biopsy Study in Atopic Dermatitis
The study consisted of 2 periods, i.e., a double-blind period from Day 1 to Day 15 skin biopsy collection, and an open-label period from Day 15 skin biopsy collection to the end of study (Day 71). Each participant received double-blind topical administration of crisaborole ointment 2 percent (%) for 1 target lesion and placebo ointment vehicle (referred to as vehicle) for the other target lesion (i.e., each participant was treated with both crisaborole and vehicle), twice daily from Day 1 to Day 14; then received open-label topical administration of crisaborole ointment 2% for all atopic dermatitis skin areas (excluding scalp) twice daily from Day 15 to Day 42.
