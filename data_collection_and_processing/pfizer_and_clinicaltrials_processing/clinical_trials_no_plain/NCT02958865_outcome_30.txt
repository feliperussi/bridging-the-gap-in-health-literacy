Study to Compare Oral PF-06651600, PF-06700841 and Placebo in Subjects With Moderate to Severe Ulcerative Colitis
The SF-36 version 2 (Acute version) is a 36-item generic health status measure. It measures 8 general health concepts or domains: Physical Functioning (PF), Role-Physical (RP), Bodily Pain (BP), General Health (GH), Vitality (VT), Social Functioning (SF), Role-Emotional (RE), and Mental Health (MH). These 8 domains can also be summarized as physical and mental component scores. The summary component scores, Physical Component Summary (PCS) and Mental Component Summary (MCS), are based on a normalized sum of the 8 scale scores PF, RP, BP, GH, VT, SF, RE, and MH . All domains and summary components are scored such that a higher score indicates a higher functioning or health level. The minimum and maximum scores of the PCS Score are 6.1 and 79.7, respectively. The minimum and maximum scores of the MCS Score are -3.8 and 78.7, respectively.
