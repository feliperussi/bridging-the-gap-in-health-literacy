A Study Evaluating Intensive Chemotherapy With or Without Glasdegib or Azacitidine With or Without Glasdegib In Patients With Previously Untreated Acute Myeloid Leukemia
Triplicate 12-lead ECG measurements (each recording separated by approximately 2 minutes) were performed and average was calculated. The time corresponding to beginning of depolarization to repolarization of the ventricles (QT interval) was adjusted for RR interval using QT and RR from each ECG by Fridericia's formula (QTcF = QT divided by cube root of RR) and by Bazette's formula (QTcB = QT divided by square root of RR). Participants with maximum increase from baseline of <=450 to >500 msec (post-baseline) were summarized. Number of participants with shift from baseline for QTc were assessed. Only those QTc parameters in which at least 1 participant had data were reported.
