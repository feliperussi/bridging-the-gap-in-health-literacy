A Positron Emission Tomography/Computed Tomography (PET/CT) Bone Imaging Study in Patients Receiving Enzalutamide for Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer (CRPC)
Global SUVhetero score:Sum of(SUVmean of each lesion minus global SUVmean of all lesion)^2/number of lesions,measure of heterogeneity of tumor activity across all bone lesions.SUVmean(mean NaF uptake)indicated average activity of each lesions.Real limits for SUVhetero score ranged:0(minimum) to infinite(maximum).Higher global SUVhetero score:more heterogeneity in bone lesion activity.NaF-3 performed on any of these 1)PSA progression(increase of>=25% and absolute increase of>=2.0ng/mL above nadir);2)bone PD(appearance of>=2 new lesions after screening assessed by 99mTc-MDP bone scintigraphy);3)soft tissue PD(RECIST1.1);4)clinically relevant progression by investigator;5)at 2years without progression after treatment initiation.PD perRECIST1.1:>=20%increase in sum of diameters of target lesions,(reference smallest sum on study,this included baseline sum if that is smallest on study),relative increase of20%,sum of diameters indicated absolute increase of>=5mm,appearance of>=1 new lesions.
