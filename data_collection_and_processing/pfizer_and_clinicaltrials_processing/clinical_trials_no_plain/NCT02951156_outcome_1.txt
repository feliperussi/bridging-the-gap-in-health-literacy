ORR was defined as percentage of participants with complete response (CR) or partial response (PR), as assessed by investigator per lugano response classification criteria. CR was defined as a score of 1 (no uptake above background), 2 (uptake less than or equal to [<=] mediastinum), or 3 (uptake less than [<] mediastinum but <=liver) with or without a residual mass on PET 5-point scale (5-PS), for lymph nodes and extralymphatic sites; no new lesions; no evidence of fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-avid disease in bone marrow. PR was defined as >=50% decrease in SPD of up to six of the largest dominant lymph nodes, no increase in size of other nodes, liver, or spleen volume, a >=50% decrease in sum of products of diameters (SPD) of hepatic and splenic nodules, absence of other organ involvement, and no new sites of disease.
