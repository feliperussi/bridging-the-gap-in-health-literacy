Low DBP: <=50 mmHg with decrease from baseline of >=15 mmHg. High DBP: >=100 mmHg with increase from baseline of >=15 mmHg. Low heart rate: <=50 beats/min with decrease from baseline of >=15 beats/min. High heart rate: >=120 beats/min with increase from baseline of >=15 beats/min. Low temperature: <=36 degree Celsius (C). High temperature: >=37.5 degree C. Low Weight: decrease from baseline >=20%. High weight: increase from baseline >=10%.
