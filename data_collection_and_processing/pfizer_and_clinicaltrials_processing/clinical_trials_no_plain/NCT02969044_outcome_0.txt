Study To Assess The Efficacy And Safety Of Pf-06651600 In Subjects With Rheumatoid Arthritis With An Inadequate Response To Methotrexate
The SDAI is the numerical sum of five outcome parameters: tender joint count (TJC) and swollen joint count (SJC) based on a 28-joint assessment, patient global assessment (PtGA) and physician global assessment (PGA) assessed on a visual analogue scale (VAS) scale ranging from 0 to 10 centimeter (cm), where higher scores=greater affection due to disease activity, and C-reactive protein (CRP) measured in terms of milligram per deciliter (mg/dL). SDAI total score= 0 to 86. SDAI greater than or equal to (<=) 3.3 indicates disease remission, greater than (>) 3.4 to 11 = low disease activity, >11 to 26 = moderate disease activity, and >26 = high disease activity.
