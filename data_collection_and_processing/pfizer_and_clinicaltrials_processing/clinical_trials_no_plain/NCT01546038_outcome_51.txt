A Study To Evaluate PF-04449913 With Chemotherapy In Patients With Acute Myeloid Leukemia or Myelodysplastic Syndrome
An adverse event (AE) was any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation participant administered a product or medical device; the event did not necessarily had a causal relationship with the treatment or usage. Treatment Emergent AEs were those with initial onset or increasing in severity after the first dose of study medication and occurred within 28 days post last dose. Treatment-related AEs were AEs related to glasdegib and/or backbone chemotherapy. AEs were graded by the investigator according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0 : Grade 1: mild AE; Grade 2: moderate AE; Grade 3: severe AE; Grade 4: life-threatening consequences, urgent intervention indicated; Grade 5: death related to AE.
