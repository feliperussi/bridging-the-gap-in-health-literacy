Talazoparib For Neoadjuvant Treatment Of Germline BRCA1/2 Mutation Patients With Early Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2 Negative Breast Cancer
EORTC QLQ-C30 is a 30-item cancer-specific instrument that assesses participant reported outcomes, consisting of 5 functional scales, 3 symptoms scales, a GHS/QoL scale, and 6 single-item scales. The GHS/QoL scale has 7 possible scores of responses (1=very poor to 7=excellent). All other items have 4 possible scores (1=not at all to 4=very much).

For the GHS/QoL scale, participants rated their overall health and quality of life within the past week. A linear transformation was applied to the raw scores so that all transformed scores lie between 0 to 100, with 0 being the worst and 100 being the best. A 10 point change from baseline was used to indicate clinically meaningful change. Definitive deterioration was defined as â‰¥10 point decrease from baseline without any subsequent <10 point decrease.

Probability of not achieving definitive deterioration (being event-free) at specified time points (3 and 6 months post-baseline) using the Kaplan Meier method were reported.
