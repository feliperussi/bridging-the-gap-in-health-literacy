ASAS20 assess 4 domains: PGA of Disease (assess disease activity on a scale of 0 [not active] to 10 [very active], high score=more disease activity), total back pain (scale of 0 [no pain] to 10 [most severe pain], high score=more severity), Function (BASFI; participant's level of ability on scale of 0 [easy] to 10 [impossible], low score= better functional health) and Inflammation (morning stiffness, Mean of Q5 and Q6 of BASDAI defined as 6-item questionnaire measure disease activity on a scale of 0 [none] to 10 [severe], high score=more disease activity). ASAS20 response: >= 20% improvement from baseline in disease activity and absolute change of >=1 unit in >=3 domains and no worsening of >=20% and an absolute change of >=1 unit in remaining domain.
