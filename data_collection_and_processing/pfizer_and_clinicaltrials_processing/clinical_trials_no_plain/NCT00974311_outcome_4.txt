Safety and Efficacy Study of MDV3100 in Patients With Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer Who Have Been Previously Treated With Docetaxel-based Chemotherapy
Time to PSA progression was defined as time from randomization to PSA progression. Participants who did not reach the endpoint were right censored at their last assessment or for participants with no post-baseline PSA assessment, date of randomization. For participants with PSA declines at Week 13, the PSA progression date was defined as the date that a >=25% increase and an absolute increase of >=2 nanogram per milliliter (ng/mL) above the nadir was documented, which was confirmed by a second consecutive value obtained 3 or more weeks later (required only if PSA progression did not occur at last PSA assessment). For participants with no PSA declines at Week 13, PSA progression date was defined as the date that a >=25% increase and an absolute increase of >=2 ng/mL above the baseline was documented, which was confirmed by a second consecutive value 3 or more weeks later (required only if PSA progression did not occur at last PSA assessment).
