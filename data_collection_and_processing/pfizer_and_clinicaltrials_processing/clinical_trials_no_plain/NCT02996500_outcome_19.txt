Safety and Efficacy of Pf-06650833 In Subjects With Rheumatoid Arthritis, With An Inadequate Response To Methotrexate
The TJC (28) included the following joints: shoulders, elbows, wrists, metatarsophalangeal (MCP) joints, PIP joints, and knees. This count was calculated from the TJC (68) assessed. The SJC (28) included the same joints as TJC (28), and was calculated from the SJC 66 assessed for swelling.Sixty eight (68) joints were assessed by a blinded joint assessor to determine the number of joints that were considered tender or painful. The 68 joints assessed were: temporomandibular, sternoclavicular, acromioclavicular; shoulder, elbow, wrist, MCPs, thumb interphalangeal, proximal interphalangeals, and distal interphalangeals; hip, knee, ankle, tarsus, metatarsophalangeals, great toe interphalangeal, proximal and distal interphalangeals combined. Sixty-six (66) joints were assessed for swelling, the same as those listed for TJC, excluding the right and left hip joints. The efficacy endpoint for the tofatinicib arm was an exploratory endpoint and neither primary nor secondary endpoints.
