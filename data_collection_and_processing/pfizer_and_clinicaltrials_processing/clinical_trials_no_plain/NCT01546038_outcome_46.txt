A Study To Evaluate PF-04449913 With Chemotherapy In Patients With Acute Myeloid Leukemia or Myelodysplastic Syndrome
Maximum absolute values and increases from baseline were summarized for QTcF interval (time from the beginning of Q wave to the end of T wave corresponding to electrical systole corrected for heart rate using Fridericia's formula). Number of participants with QTcF meeting the following criteria is presented:QTcF interval:<450 msec; QTcF interval: 450 to <480 msec; QTcF interval: 480 to <500 msec; QTcF interval >=500 msec; QTcF interval increase from baseline: <30 msec; QTcF interval increase from baseline: 30 to <60 msec; QTcF interval increase from baseline >=60 msec. End of treatment in the time frame were defined as: maximum of 12 cycles from start of therapy or until disease progression or relapse, participant refusal or unacceptable toxicity occurred, whichever came first.
