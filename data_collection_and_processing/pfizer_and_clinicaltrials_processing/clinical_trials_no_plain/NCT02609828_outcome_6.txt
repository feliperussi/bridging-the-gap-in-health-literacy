Phase 3 Study on the Efficacy and Safety of Tanezumab in Patients With Cancer Pain Due to Bone Metastasis Who Are Taking Background Opioid Therapy
Daily worst pain intensity in the index bone metastasis cancer pain site was assessed by participants on an 11 point pain intensity NRS ranging from 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst possible pain), where higher scores signified more severity of pain. The participants recorded their daily worst pain at the painful site during the past 24 hours by choosing the appropriate number from 0 to 10 on IRT diaries. Baseline pain intensity value was mean of the daily worst pain intensity NRS scores during the baseline assessment period prior to randomization. Baseline assessment period was up to 5 days prior to dosing. The Weeks 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16 and 24 pain intensity value is the mean of the daily worst pain intensity scores for the 7 days prior to the each specified week.
