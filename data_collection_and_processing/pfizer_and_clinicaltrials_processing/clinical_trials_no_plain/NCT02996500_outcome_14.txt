Safety and Efficacy of Pf-06650833 In Subjects With Rheumatoid Arthritis, With An Inadequate Response To Methotrexate
The DAS assessment is a continuous composite measure derived using differential weighting given to each component. The components of the DAS28-4 (CRP) assessment included: tender joint count with 28 joints assessed, swollen joint count with 28 joints assessed, hs-CRP and PtGA. DAS28-4 (CRP) was calculated as 0.56 sqrt (DAS 28 tender joint count) + 0.28 sqrt (DAS 28 swollen joint count) + 0.36 ln(CRP [mg/L] +1) + 0.014 (PtGA [mm]) + 0.96. Total score range: 0-9.4. Higher score indicated more disease activity. Tofacitinib was included in this study as an active control. The efficacy endpoint for the tofatinicib arm was an exploratory endpoint and neither primary nor secondary endpoints.
