Avelumab in Previously Untreated Patients With Epithelial Ovarian Cancer (JAVELIN OVARIAN 100)
Ctrough is the concentration at the end of the dosing interval when avelumab was given as a Q2W regimen in the absence of carboplatin and paclitaxel following 1 cycle of avelumab dosing, i.e. before administration of drug on Day 1 of cycle 2. Ctrough of Avelumab in the absence of chemotherapy (i.e. in the maintenance phase) has been reported. The LLQ of avelumab was 0.20 micro-gram per milliliter (mcg/mL). Data for this outcome measure was not reported for reporting arms "PK: Chemotherapy + Avelumab followed by Avelumab" (since data was not planned to be collected 1 cycle after the initiation of avelumab dosing ) and "PK: Chemotherapy followed by Observation" (since avelumab was not administered in this arm and therefore data collection was not planned).
