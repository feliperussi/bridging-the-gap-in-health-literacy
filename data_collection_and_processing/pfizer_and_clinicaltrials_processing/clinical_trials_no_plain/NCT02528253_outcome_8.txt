A Phase 3 Study of Tanezumab for Chronic Low Back Pain
PGA of LBP was assessed by asking a question to participants: "Considering all the ways your low back pain affects you, how are you doing today?" Participants responded on a 5 point Likert scale ranging from 1-5, using IRT, where 1=very good (asymptomatic and no limitation of normal activities); 2=good (mild symptoms and no limitation of normal activities); 3=fair (moderate symptoms and limitation of some normal activities); 4=poor (severe symptoms and inability to carry out most normal activities); and 5=very poor (very severe symptoms which are intolerable and inability to carry out all normal activities). Higher scores indicated worsening of condition.
