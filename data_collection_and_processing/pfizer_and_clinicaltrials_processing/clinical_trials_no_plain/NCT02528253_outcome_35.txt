A Phase 3 Study of Tanezumab for Chronic Low Back Pain
In case of inadequate pain relief, acetaminophen/paracetamol caplets, tablets, or capsules up to 3000 mg per day up to 3 days in a week could be taken as rescue medication between day 1 and week 56. Number of participants with any use of rescue medication during the particular study week were summarized. As pre specified intent of study, for analyses after week 16 where multiple imputation was used, data was reported per 3 arms. This is because participants who received placebo from Day 1 and received tanezumab 5/10 mg at week 16, received placebo for the first 16 weeks, and their data before week 16 were not be imputed into analyses after week 16.
