A Study Of Oral PF-02341066, A C-Met/Hepatocyte Growth Factor Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor, In Patients With Advanced Cancer
PF-02341066 may work in cancer by blocking the cell growth, migration and invasion of tumor cells. PF-02341066 is a new class of drugs called c-Met/Hepatocyte growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors. This compound is also an inhibitor of the anaplastic lymphoma kinase (called ALK) tyrosine kinase and ROS receptor tyrosine kinases. This research study is the first time PF-02341066 will be given to people. PF-02341066 is taken by mouth daily.
