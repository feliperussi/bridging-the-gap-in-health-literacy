A Study Of Crizotinib Versus Chemotherapy In Previously Untreated ALK Positive East Asian Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Patients
PFS was defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of the first documentation of objective tumor progression (by IRR) or death on study due to any cause, whichever occured first. If tumor progression data included more than 1 date, the first date was used. PFS (in months) was calculated as (first event date - randomization date +1)/30.44. Progression is defined using RECIST v1.1, as at least a 20% increase (including an absolute increase of at least 5 millimeters) in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study and/or unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions and/or appearance of 1 or more new lesions.
