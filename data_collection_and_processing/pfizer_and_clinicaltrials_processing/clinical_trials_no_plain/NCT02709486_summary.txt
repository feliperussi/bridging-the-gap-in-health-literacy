Study of the Analgesic Efficacy and Safety of Subcutaneous Tanezumab in Subjects With Osteoarthritis of the Hip or Knee.
Tanezumab is a monoclonal antibody that binds to and inhibits the actions of nerve growth factor (NGF). The Nerve Growth Factor Inhibitor (NGFI) class may offer an important breakthrough in the treatment of chronic pain and is under clinical investigation for the treatment of pain associated with osteoarthritis or other chronic pain conditions.

The primary objective of this study is to demonstrate superior efficacy of tanezumab 5 mg and 2.5 mg administered subcutaneously (SC) every 8 weeks versus placebo at Week 24 in subjects with osteoarthritis of the knee or hip. The 2.5 mg dose was shown to provide efficacy benefits with a favorable safety profile when administered intravenously in previous Phase 3 clinical trials. The 5 mg dose is expected to provide added efficacy benefit over the 2.5 mg dose based on data from previous studies.
