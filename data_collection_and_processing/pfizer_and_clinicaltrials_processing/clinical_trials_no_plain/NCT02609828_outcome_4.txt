Phase 3 Study on the Efficacy and Safety of Tanezumab in Patients With Cancer Pain Due to Bone Metastasis Who Are Taking Background Opioid Therapy
Weekly worst pain intensity in the non-index cancer pain site was assessed by participants on an 11 point pain intensity NRS ranging from 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst possible pain), higher scores signified more severity of pain. Non-index cancer pan sites were the most painful cancer pain sites other than the index bone metastasis cancer pain site. The participants describe their weekly worst pain at the painful site by choosing the appropriate number from 0 to 10 on IRT diaries. Baseline weekly worst pain intensity was weekly worst pain intensity NRS score recorded on any day during the baseline assessment period. Five days prior to dosing was considered as baseline assessment period. The Weeks 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16 and 24 weekly worst pain intensity value was the weekly worst pain intensity NRS scores which was recorded on any day from the span of 7 days prior to specified week.
