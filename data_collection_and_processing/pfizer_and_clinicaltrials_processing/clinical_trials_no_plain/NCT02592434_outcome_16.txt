Efficacy Study Of Tofacitinib In Pediatric JIA Population
JIA ACR90 response defined as: >=90% improvement in 3 out of 6 JIA core set variables with no more than 1 out of 6 JIA core set variables worsened by >=30%. Six core variables: 1) Number of joints with active arthritis (defined as joint with swelling or, in absence of swelling, limited range of motion accompanied by either pain on motion or tenderness), 2) Number of joints with limited range of motion, 3) Physician global evaluation of disease activity (assessed on a VAS of 0 [no activity] to 10 [maximum activity]), 4) Parent/legal guardian/participant global assessment of overall well-being (assessed on a VAS of 0 [very well] to 10 [very poor], 5) CHAQ-DI: 30 questions in 8 domains, each question answered on scale of 0=without difficulty to 3=unable to do; scores of each domain were averaged to derive total CHAQ-DI score, which ranges from 0 (minimum dysfunction) to 3 (most severe dysfunction);6) ESR.
