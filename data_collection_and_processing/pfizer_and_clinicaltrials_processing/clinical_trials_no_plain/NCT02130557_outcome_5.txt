A Multicenter Phase 3, Open-Label Study of Bosutinib Versus Imatinib in Adult Patients With Newly Diagnosed Chronic Phase Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia
EFS was defined as time from randomization to death due to any cause, transformation to AP or BP at any time, confirmed loss of complete hematologic response (CHR), confirmed loss of CCyR or censoring. Loss of CHR was defined as a hematologic assessment of non-CHR (chronic phase, AP, or BP) confirmed by 2 assessments at least 4 weeks apart. Loss of CHR was defined as appearance of any of the following: WBC count that rises to >20.0*10^9/L, platelet count rises to >=600*10^9/L, appearance of palpable spleen or other extramedullary involvement proven by biopsy, appearance of 5% myelocytes in peripheral blood, appearance of blasts or promyelocytes in peripheral blood. Loss of CCyR was defined as at least 1 Ph+ metaphase from analysis of <100 metaphases confirmed by follow up cytogenetic analysis after 1 month. Cumulative incidence of EFS was defined as percentage of participants with EFS event at Month 60 and was adjusted for competing risk of treatment discontinuation without event.
