Safety and Efficacy Study of Enzalutamide in Patients With Nonmetastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer
Time to PSA progression was defined as the time from randomization to the date of first PSA value demonstrating progression, which was subsequently confirmed. For participants with PSA decline at Week 17, PSA progression was defined according to Prostate Cancer Working Group 2 (PCWG2) guidelines as the date that a 25% or greater increase and an absolute increase of 2 nanograms per milliliter (ng/mL) above the nadir (or baseline for participants with no PSA decline by Week 17) was documented, which was confirmed by a second consecutive value obtained at least 3 weeks or later. Participants without confirmed PSA progression at the time of analysis were right censored at the date of last PSA assessment before the analysis data cut-off date for the purposes of analysis. Analysis was based on Kaplan-Meier estimates.
