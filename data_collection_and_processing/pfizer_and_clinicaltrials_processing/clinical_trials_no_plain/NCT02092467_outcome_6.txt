Safety Study Of Tofacitinib Versus Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF) Inhibitor In Subjects With Rheumatoid Arthritis
Cardiovascular events (adjudicated) were death (coronary and non-coronary), MI, all coronary revascularization, unstable angina, new ischemic heart disease, stroke (fatal and non-fatal), transient ischemic attack (TIA), congestive heart failure (CHF), peripheral arterial vascular disease (PAVD), deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, arterial embolism, arterial thrombosis. Incidence rate was total number of participants with admissible events divided by total (for all qualifying participants) time at risk for cohort/treatment group of interest. Risk period (RP) was the minimum of last contact date or last study treatment dose date + 28 days. Last contact date was maximum of (AE start date, AE stop date, last study visit date, withdrawal date, telephone contact date). In case of death, last contact date was death date. First events counted within RP. Participant did not have an event or had an event outside risk period were censored at end of RP.
