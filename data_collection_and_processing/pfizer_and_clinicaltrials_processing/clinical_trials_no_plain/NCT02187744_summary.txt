A Study Of PF-05280014 Or Trastuzumab Plus Taxotere® And Carboplatin In HER2 Positive Breast Cancer In The Neoadjuvant Setting (REFLECTIONS B327-04)
The current study will compare PK, efficacy, safety, and immunogenicity of PF-05280014 (Trastuzumab-Pfizer) in combination with Taxotere® and Carboplatin (Paraplatin) versus Herceptin® (Trastuzumab-EU) approved in the EU in combination with Taxotere® and Carboplatin (Paraplatin) in patients with operable HER2 positive, breast cancer in the neoadjuvant setting. The hypothesis to be tested in this study is the percentage of patients with steady state Cycle 5 Ctrough (Cycle 6 pre-dose) >20 µg/mL of trastuzumab-Pfizer is similar to EU-approved trastuzumab, using a margin of -12.5%.
