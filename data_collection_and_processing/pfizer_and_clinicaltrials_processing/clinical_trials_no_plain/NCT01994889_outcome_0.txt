Safety and Efficacy of Tafamidis in Patients With Transthyretin Cardiomyopathy
All-cause mortality and frequency of cardiovascular hospitalization were analyzed using Finkelstein-Schoenfeld method. The method combines all-cause mortality and frequency of CV-related hospitalizations in a hierarchical fashion using all-cause mortality first. The method compares every participant with every other participant within strata, assigning a +1 to the "better" participant and a -1 to the "worse" participant and 0 if they are "tied". Participants who discontinued for transplantation (heart transplantation and combined heart and liver transplantation) or for implantation of a cardiac mechanical assist device, were handled in the same manner as death. 'Win' represents a participant doing better based on hierarchical comparison. The reported unit is the total "wins" for each treatment group from performing such a hierarchical comparison across all 4 strata in the study.
