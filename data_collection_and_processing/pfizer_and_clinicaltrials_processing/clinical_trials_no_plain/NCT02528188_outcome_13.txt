Long Term Safety and Efficacy Study of Tanezumab in Subjects With Osteoarthritis of the Hip or Knee
Progression of OA according to Bland-Altman as defined by a decrease JSW >=1.96 times within-participant standard deviation of change in JSW. The number of participants with progression of OA in the index knee are summarized separately by the compartment of OA at baseline (medial or lateral). Kellgren-Lawrence grade system was a method of classifying the severity of knee OA using five grades i.e. 0 [no radiographic features of OA], 1 [doubtful joint space narrowing (JSN) and possible osteophytic lipping], 2 [definite osteophytes and possible JSN on anteroposterior weight-bearing radiograph], 3 [multiple osteophytes, definite JSN, sclerosis, possible bony deformity], 4 [large osteophytes, marked JSN, severe sclerosis and definite bony deformity]. Higher grade indicating worse knee function.
