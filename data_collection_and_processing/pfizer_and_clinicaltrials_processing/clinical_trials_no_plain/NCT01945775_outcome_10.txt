A Study Evaluating Talazoparib (BMN 673), a PARP Inhibitor, in Advanced and/or Metastatic Breast Cancer Patients With BRCA Mutation (EMBRACA Study)
EORTC QLQ-C30: cancer-specific instrument with 30 questions to assess the participant QoL. First 28 questions used to evaluate 5 functional scales (physical, role, cognitive, emotional, social), 3 symptom scales (fatigue, nausea and vomiting, pain) and other single items (dyspnea, appetite loss, insomnia, constipation, diarrhea, financial difficulties). Each question assessed on 4-point scale (1= not at all, 2= a little, 3= quite a bit, 4= very much); functional scales: higher score = better level of functioning; symptom scale: higher score = more severe symptoms; for single items: higher score= more severe problem. Last 2 questions used to evaluate global health status (GHS)/QoL. Each question was assessed on 7-point scale (1= very poor to 7= excellent). Scores averaged, transformed to 0-100 scale; higher score=better quality of life/better level of functioning. Change from baseline was calculated by subtracting the baseline value from the average value of Week 4 to 160.
