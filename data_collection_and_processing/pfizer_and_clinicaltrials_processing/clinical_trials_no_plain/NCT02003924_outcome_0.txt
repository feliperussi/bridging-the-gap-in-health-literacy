Safety and Efficacy Study of Enzalutamide in Patients With Nonmetastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer
MFS:time from randomization to first date of radiographic progression (RP) (by Blinded independent central radiology review [BICR]) at any time or death within 112 days of treatment discontinuation without evidence of RP.RP for bone disease:appearance of 1 or more metastatic lesions on bone scan.RP for soft tissue disease:per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors,[RECIST 1.1])-at least a 20 percent (%) increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions,taking as reference the smallest sum on study (includes the baseline sum if smallest on study).Participants who did not have MFS event at the time of analysis data cut-off (28 June 2017) were censored at date of last assessment showing no objective evidence of RP prior to skeletal-related event or two or more consecutive missed tumor assessments. Participants who were randomized but later confirmed to have metastatic disease before randomization were censored on date of randomization. Analysis was based on Kaplan-Meier estimates.
