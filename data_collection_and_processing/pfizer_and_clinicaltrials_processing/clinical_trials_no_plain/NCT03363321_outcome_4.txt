PF-06741086 Long-term Treatment in Severe Hemophilia
Physical examinations were conducted by a physician, trained physician's assistant, or nurse practitioner as acceptable according to local regulation. A full physical examination included head, ears, eyes, nose, mouth, skin, heart and lung examinations, lymph nodes, gastrointestinal, musculoskeletal, and neurological systems. The limited or abbreviated physical examination was focused on general appearance, the respiratory and cardiovascular systems, as well as towards participant reported symptoms. For measuring weight, a scale with appropriate range and resolution was used and must have been placed on a stable, flat surface. Participants removed shoes, bulky layers of clothing, and jackets so that only light clothing remains. They also removed the contents of their pockets and remain still during measurement of weight.
