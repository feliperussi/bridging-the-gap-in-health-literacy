A Study Of PF-05212384 In Combination With Other Anti-Tumor Agents and in Combination With Cisplatin in Patients With Triple Negative Breast Cancer in an Expansion Arm (TNBC)
DLT was defined as any of the following adverse events (AEs) attributable to the combination: (1) hematologic: grade 4 neutropenia lasting >7 days; febrile neutropenia; grade >=3 neutropenia with infection; grade 3 thrombocytopenia with bleeding; grade 4 thrombocytopenia; (2) non-hematologic: grade >=2 pneumonitis; grade>=3 toxicities, except pneumonitis, and excluding those that had not been maximally treated; persistent, intolerable toxicities which resulted in the failure to deliver at least 3 of the 4 doses of PF-05212384 for Arms A and B or at least 3 of the 4 doses of PF-05212384 and 75% of dacomitinib for Arm C during the first cycle; the persistent, intolerable toxicities which result in delay of the start of the second cycle by more than 2 weeks relative to the scheduled start; in an asymptomatic participant, the grade 3 QTc prolongation persists after correction of any reversible causes.
