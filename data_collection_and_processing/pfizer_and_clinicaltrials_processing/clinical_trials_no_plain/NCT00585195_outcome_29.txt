A Study Of Oral PF-02341066, A C-Met/Hepatocyte Growth Factor Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor, In Patients With Advanced Cancer
Duration of response (DoR) was the time from first documentation of PR or CR to date of first documentation of progressive disease (PD) or death due to any cause. PR: At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameters of target lesions (taking as reference the baseline sum), without progression of non-target lesions and no appearance of new lesions indicated partial response. CR: Disappearance of all target and non-target lesions, normalization of tumor marker levels, and no appearance of new lesions indicated complete response. PD: >=20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions taking as references the smallest sum longest diameter recorded since the treatment started, unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions, or the appearance of 1 or more new lesions.
