Study to Investigate Efficacy and Safety of PF-04965842 in Subjects Aged 12 Years and Over With Moderate to Severe Atopic Dermatitis With the Option of Rescue Treatment in Flaring Subjects
SCORAD: scoring index for AD combining extent (A), severity (B), subjective symptoms (C). A: rule of 9 used to calculate BSA affected by AD as % of whole BSA for each body region- head and neck 9%; upper limbs 9% each; lower limbs 18% each; anterior trunk 18%; back 18%; genitals 1%. Score of each body region added to determine A (0-100). B: severity of each sign (erythema; edema; oozing; excoriation; skin thickening; dryness) was assessed as none (0), mild (1), moderate (2), severe (3). Severity scores added to give B (0-18). C: pruritus and sleep loss, each were scored by participant/caregiver using VAS where, 0=no itch/no sleep loss and 10=worst imaginable itch/sleep loss, higher scores=worse symptoms. Scores for itch and sleep loss added to give 'C' (0-20). SCORAD calculated as: A/5+7*B/2+C; range (0-103); higher values=worse outcome.
