Safety and Efficacy Study of Enzalutamide Versus Bicalutamide in Men With Prostate Cancer
PFS was defined as time from randomization to earliest objective evidence of prostate specific-antigen (PSA) progression, radiographic progression, or death on study. PSA progression was defined as ≥ 25% increase in PSA with an absolute increase ≥ 2 ng/mL above the nadir and was to be confirmed by a second consecutive assessment. Radiographic progression in bone was based on The Prostate Cancer Clinical Trials Working Group (PCWG2) guidelines defined as at least 2 new lesions on bone scan. Radiographic progression in soft tissue on Computerized Tomography/Magnetic Resonance Imaging (CT/MRI) was based on Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1). CT/MRI and bone scans were read locally by the same radiologist (or nuclear medicine physician for interpretation of bone scans) whenever possible. Participants not known to have had a PFS event at the time of the analysis data cutoff were censored at the date of last assessment.
