A Phase 2 Study to Evaluate the Safety, Efficacy, Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics of PF-06252616 in Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy
6MWD evaluated ambulation ability by measuring the distance walked in 6 minutes. MMRM was used to analyze the change from baseline on 6MWD for the natural history control group compared to placebo group (Sequence 3). This MMRM was established to assess the appropriateness on using the natural history control group as a comparator. The natural history control group was established by filtering the CINRG natural history database. Participants who met the following requirements at baseline and had evaluable 6MWD data on Week 49 were included in this group: 1) age: 6 to <16 years; 2)treatment of glucocorticoid steroids >=6 months prior to baseline and continuous use until the latest visit week; 3) 4SC: 2-15.9 seconds; 4) participants who were ambulatory at baseline; 5) LVEF: >=55% or missing.
