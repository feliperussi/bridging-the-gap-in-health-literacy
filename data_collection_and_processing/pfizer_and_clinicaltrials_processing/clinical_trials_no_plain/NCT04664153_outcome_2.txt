Study To Assess Efficacy, Safety, Tolerability And Pharmacokinetics Of PF-07038124 Ointment In Participants With Atopic Dermatitis Or Plaque Psoriasis
IGA assessed severity of AD on a 5 point scale (0 to 4, higher scores indicate more severity). Scores: 0= clear, no inflammatory signs of AD; 1= almost clear, AD not fully cleared-light pink residual lesions (except post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation), just perceptible erythema, papulation/induration lichenification, excoriation, and no oozing/crusting; 2= mild AD with light red lesions, slight but definite erythema, papulation/induration, lichenification, excoriation and no oozing/crusting; 3= moderate AD with red lesions, moderate erythema, papulation/induration, lichenification, excoriation and slight oozing/crusting; 4= severe AD with deep dark red lesions, severe erythema, papulation/induration, lichenification, excoriation and moderate to severe oozing/crusting. In this OM, percentages of participants with an IGA score of 0 or 1 and a reduction of >=2 from Baseline in IGA score are reported.
