Efficacy and Safety of Tofacitinib in Subjects With Active Ankylosing Spondylitis (AS)
The BASMI was used to assess the axial status and spinal mobility (cervical, dorsal and lumbar spine, hips and pelvic soft tissue) and was analyzed using the linear function method. BASMI score composed of five clinical measures: lateral spinal flexion, tragus-to-wall distance, lumbar flexion (modified Schober), maximal intermalleolar distance, and cervical rotation. BASMI - Linear Method score was the average of 5 individual component scores mapped between 0 and 10 and thus the BASMI - Linear Method total score ranged from 0 (very good) to 10 (very poor), wherein higher scores indicated more impairment of axial status and spinal mobility; lower scores indicated better health status.
