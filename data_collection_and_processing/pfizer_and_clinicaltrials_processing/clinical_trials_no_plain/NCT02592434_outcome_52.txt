Efficacy Study Of Tofacitinib In Pediatric JIA Population
Percentage of body surface area affected by psoriasis was estimated using the palm method. One of the participant's palm to PIP and thumb together represented 1% of total BSA. Regions of the body were assigned specific number of palms with percentage (Head and Neck = 10% [10 palms], Upper extremities = 20% [20 palms], Trunk [axillae and groin] = 30% [30 palms], Lower extremities [buttocks] = 40% [40 palms]). The number of palms of psoriatic skin in a body region was used to determine the extent (%) to which a body region was involved with psoriasis. The total BSA affected was the summation of individual regions affected.
