A Study of Talazoparib in Men With DNA Repair Defects and Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer
DOR was defined as the time from the first objective evidence of soft tissue response (CR or PR, whichever is earlier) per RECIST 1.1 and no evidence of confirmed bone disease progression per PCWG3 to the date of first objective evidence of radiographic progression or death due to any cause without evidence of radiographic progression, whichever occurs first. RECIST 1.1 criteria, CR: disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) must have reduction in short axis to less than 10 mm. Disappearance of all non-target lesions and normalization of tumor marker level. All lymph nodes must be non-pathological in size (less than 10 mm short axis); PR: at least 30 % decrease in sum of diameters of target lesions taking as reference baseline sum diameters.
