An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a study participant administered a product or medical device; the event need not necessarily have a causal relationship with the treatment or usage. TEAEs are events between the first dose of study drug up to 28 days after last dose that were absent before treatment or that worsened relative to pretreatment state. A SAE is any untoward medical occurrence at any dose that: results in death; is life-threatening (immediate risk of death); requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization; results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity (substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions); results in congenital anomaly/birth defect; or that is considered to be an important medical event.
