Efficacy Study Of Tofacitinib In Pediatric JIA Population
CHAQ is a valid assessment of functional disability, discomfort in participants with rheumatic diseases. It comprises of three indices: Disability and Discomfort, and global assessment of arthritis (overall well-being). CHAQ-DI: as a measure of functional ability, consists of 30 questions in 8 domains: dressing/grooming, arising, eating, walking, hygiene, reach, grip, and activities-distributed, among a total of 30 items. Each question was rated on a 4-point scale of difficulty in performance ranges from 0 (no difficulty) to 3 (unable to do). To calculate the overall score, the participant must have a domain score in at least 6 of the 8 domains. Scores of 8 domains were averaged to calculate the CHAQ-DI total score which ranges from 0 (no or minimal physical dysfunction) to 3 (very severe physical dysfunction), higher score indicates more disability. Change from double-blind baseline at Week 44 in DI total score is reported.
