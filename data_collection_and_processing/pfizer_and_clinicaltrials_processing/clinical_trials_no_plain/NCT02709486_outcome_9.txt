Study of the Analgesic Efficacy and Safety of Subcutaneous Tanezumab in Subjects With Osteoarthritis of the Hip or Knee.
Participants were considered as OMERACT-OARSI responders: if the change (improvement) from baseline to week of interest was greater than or equal to (>=) 50 percent and >= 2 units in either WOMAC pain subscale or physical function subscale score; if change (improvement) from baseline to week of interest was >=20 percent and >=1 unit in at least 2 of the following: 1) WOMAC pain subscale score, 2) WOMAC physical function subscale score, 3) PGA of osteoarthritis. WOMAC pain subscale assess amount of pain experienced (score: 0 [no pain] to 10 [extreme pain], higher score = more pain), WOMAC physical function subscale assess degree of difficulty experienced (score: 0 [minimum difficulty] to 10 [extreme difficulty], higher score = worse physical function) and PGA of OA (score: 1 [very good] to 5 [very poor], higher score = worse condition). Missing data was imputed using mixed baseline/last observation carried forward (BOCF/LOCF).
