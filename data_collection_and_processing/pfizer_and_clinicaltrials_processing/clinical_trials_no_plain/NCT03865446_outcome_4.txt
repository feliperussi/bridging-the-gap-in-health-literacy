Evaluate Severe Hepatic Impairment on Dacomitinib PK
Systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure and pulse rate were evaluated for examination of vital signs. Criteria for potential concern in absolute values of vital sign: pulse rate: <40 beats per minute (bpm), >120 beats per minute; supine diastolic blood pressure: <50 millimeter of mercury (mm Hg); supine systolic blood pressure: <90 mm Hg. Criteria for potential concern in change from baseline in vital sign values: supine diastolic blood pressure: greater than or equal to >= 30 mm Hg increase or decrease from baseline; supine diastolic blood pressure: >=20 mm Hg increase or decrease from baseline. Only participants with vital sign parameters meeting criteria of potential clinical concern are reported.
