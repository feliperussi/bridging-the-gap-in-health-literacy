Multiple Escalating Oral Doses Study of PF-07081532 in Adult Participants With Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus
This is a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind (investigator- and participant-blinded), sponsor-open, dose-escalating study of PF-07081532 in patients with Type 2 diabetes on metformin (Parts A and C). The study may also enroll non-diabetic participants with obesity (Part B). Study participants will receive an investigational product or placebo every day for up to 28 days (Part A) or up to 42 days (Part B, optional; Part C, optional).

The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics (PK) of multiple oral doses of PF-07081532 in participants with inadequately controlled T2DM on metformin and optionally in non-diabetic obese participants.
