A Study Of PF-06463922 An ALK/ROS1 Inhibitor In Patients With Advanced Non Small Cell Lung Cancer With Specific Molecular Alterations
The probability of the first event being a CNS progression, a non-CNS progression, or death was evaluated with a competing risk approach by estimating cumulative incidence functions (range: 0-1) relative to the analysis set. The time to first event being a Competing Event (either "CNS progression" or "non CNS progression" or "Death") was defined as time from first dose until the date of that specific event. Participants not known to have any of the Competing Events were censored on the date they were last assessed for disease status for PFS. Participants who presented one type of event were counted as a competing cause of failure for the analysis of other type of events. For each type of event, the cumulative incidence function corresponding to the nearest time point preceding 1 year is presented. The results are based on independent central review.
