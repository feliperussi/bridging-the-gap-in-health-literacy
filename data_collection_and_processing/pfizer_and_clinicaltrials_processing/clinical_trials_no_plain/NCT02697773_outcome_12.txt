Percentage of participants with reduction in WOMAC physical function of at least (>=) 30%, 50%, 70% and 90% at weeks 2, 4, 8, 12, 16 and 24 compared to baseline were classified as responders to WOMAC physical function subscale. WOMAC: self-administered, disease-specific questionnaire which assesses clinically important, participant-relevant symptoms for pain, stiffness and physical function in participants with osteoarthritis. Physical function refers to participant's ability to move around and perform usual activities of daily living. WOMAC physical function subscale: 17-item questionnaire used to assess the degree of difficulty experienced due to osteoarthritis in index joint (knee or hip) during past 48 hours,calculated as mean of the scores from 17 individual questions scored on a NRS of 0 (minimum difficulty) to 10 (extreme difficulty), where higher scores indicated extreme difficulty/worse physical function. Missing data was imputed using mixed BOCF/LOCF.
