A Study Of PF-05280014 [Trastuzumab-Pfizer] Or HerceptinÂ® [Trastuzumab-EU] Plus Paclitaxel In HER2 Positive First Line Metastatic Breast Cancer Treatment (REFLECTIONS B327-02)
DOR:time from first documentation of objective response (CR or PR) to first documentation of PD/death due to any cause in absence of documented PD, based on central radiology review. As per RECIST v1.1, CR:complete disappearance of all target lesions with exception of nodal disease; all target nodes reduced in short axis <10 mm. PR: >=30% decrease from baseline of SOD of target lesions; short diameter used in sum for target nodes,longest diameter used in sum for other target lesions. PD for target disease:at least 20% increase in SOD of target lesions above smallest sum observed (over baseline if no decrease in sum observed) with minimum absolute increase of 5 mm. For non-target disease:unequivocal progression of pre-existing lesions and if overall tumor burden increased sufficiently to merit discontinuation of therapy; appearance of any new unequivocal malignant lesion was also considered PD. The 95% CI for median time to event was based on the Brookmeyer and Crowley method.
