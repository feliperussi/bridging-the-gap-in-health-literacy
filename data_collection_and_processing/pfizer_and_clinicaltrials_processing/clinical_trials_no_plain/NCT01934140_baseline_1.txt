Study to Evaluate the Long-term Antibody Persistence of GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) Biologicals' MenACWY-TT Vaccine (GSK134612) Versus Mencevax ACWY in Healthy Adolescents and Adults and Booster Response to MenACWY-TT Vaccine Administered at 10 Years Post-primary Vaccination
Persistence phase was followed up by booster phase. Persistence phase: Participants received a single 0.5 mL dose of Mencevax ACWY vaccine intramuscularly, as primary vaccination in study 107386 [NCT00356369]. Then, in this study (MENACWY-TT-99) they were evaluated for long-term persistence of immune response for 4 years (7, 8, 9 and 10 years post primary vaccination). Booster phase: All eligible participants from persistence phase who provided informed consent to enroll in booster phase, received a single 0.5 mL booster dose of MenACWY-TT vaccine intramuscularly in this study, 10 years post primary vaccination, and were followed up for 6 months after booster vaccination.
