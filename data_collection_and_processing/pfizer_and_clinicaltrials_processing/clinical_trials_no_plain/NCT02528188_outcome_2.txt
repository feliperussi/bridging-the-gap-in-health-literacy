Long Term Safety and Efficacy Study of Tanezumab in Subjects With Osteoarthritis of the Hip or Knee
WOMAC: Self-administered, disease-specific questionnaire which assesses clinically important, participant-relevant symptoms for pain, stiffness and physical function in participants with OA. The WOMAC pain subscale is a 5-item questionnaire used to assess the amount of pain experienced due to OA of index joint (knee or hip) during past 48 hours. It was calculated as the mean of scores from 5 individual questions, which may not be a whole (integer) number, scored on a numerical rating scale (NRS). Scores for each question and WOMAC Pain subscale score on NRS ranged from 0 (no pain) to 10 (extreme pain), where higher scores indicated higher pain.
