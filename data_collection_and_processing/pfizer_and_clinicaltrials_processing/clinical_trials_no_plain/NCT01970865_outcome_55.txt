A Study Of PF-06463922 An ALK/ROS1 Inhibitor In Patients With Advanced Non Small Cell Lung Cancer With Specific Molecular Alterations
European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Core Quality of Life Questionaires (EORTC QLQ)-C30 (version 3.0) consists of 30 questions assessing 5 functional domains (physical, role, emotional, cognitive and social), global quality of life (QoL), disease/treatment related symptoms (fatigue, nausea/vomiting, pain, dyspnea, insomnia, appetite loss, constipation and diarrhoea), and the perceived financial impact of disease. Each scale was transformed to a range of 0 to 100 using standard EORTC algorithm. For global QoL and functional scales, higher score indicate better performance, and improvement was defined as an increase of at least 10 points, worsening was defined as a decrease of at least 10 points. For symptom scales, higher score indicates worse symptoms, and improvement was defined as a decrease of at least 10 points, worsening was defined as an increase of at least 10 points. All scales which had not improved nor worsened were considered stable.
