Evaluation of Safety, Pharmacokinetics and Efficacy of Ceftazidime and Avibactam (CAZ-AVI ) Compared With Cefepime in Children From 3 Months to Less Than 18 Years of Age With Complicated Urinary Tract Infections (cUTIs)
Combined response was the combined assessment of clinical response and microbiological response. Favorable clinical response was defined as a clinical response of improvement and cure (at EOIV) and a clinical response of cure (at TOC). Cure defined as: resolution of all acute signs/symptoms of cUTI/improvement to such an extent that no further antimicrobial therapy required. Improvement defined as: participants who switched to oral therapy and had afebrile (temperature<=38.0Â°C) for >=24 hr; absence of new and improvement in at least 1 symptom or sign (ie, fever, pain, tenderness, elevated WBCs, elevated CRP) from Baseline and worsening of none. Favourable microbiological response was absence of the original baseline pathogen in source specimen. EOIV visit occurred within 24 hours after completion of last infusion of the study drug. TOC visit occurred within 8 to 15 days after last dose of any study drug (IV or oral).
