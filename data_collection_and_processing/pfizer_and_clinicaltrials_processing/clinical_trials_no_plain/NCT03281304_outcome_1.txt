A Study of Tofacitinib in Patients With Ulcerative Colitis in Stable Remission
Time to loss of remission(flare): time from first drug administration until time of meeting loss of remission criteria based on modified mayo score. Loss of remission: meeting at least (>=)1 criteria: increase from Baseline in rectal bleeding subscore by >=1 point and increase in endoscopic subscore by >=1 point; increase from Baseline in rectal bleeding subscore by >=2 points and endoscopic subscore >0; increase in stool frequency subscore by >=2 points and increase in endoscopic subscore by >=1 point; increase in endoscopic subscore by >=2 points. Modified mayo score included 3 components: stool frequency, rectal bleeding and endoscopic subscores: Modified mayo score included 3 components: stool frequency, rectal bleeding and endoscopic subscores, each subscore graded from 0 to 3 with higher scores for each score=more severe disease. All scores summed up to give total modified mayo score range from 0 to 9; higher scores=more severe disease.
