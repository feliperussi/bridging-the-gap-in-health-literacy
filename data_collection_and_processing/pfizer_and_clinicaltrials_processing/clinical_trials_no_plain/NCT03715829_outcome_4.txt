A Phase 2b Study To Evaluate The Efficacy And Safety Profile Of PF-06651600 And PF-06700841 In Active Non-segmental Vitiligo Subjects
The central read F-VASI was assessed based on the facial photographs taken at the site. The central read F-VASI was calculated using a formula that included contribution of affected facial surface areas showing all 6 different depigmentation rates (0.1, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 0.9 and 1) with a modified method: F-VASI (central read)=Ʃ [Affected Facial Surface Area] × 4 × [Depigmentation Rates]. Face was defined as the area from the hairline on top of the forehead to the jawline at the bottom of the cheeks. F-VASI (central read) ranged from 0.000 to 4.000 by defining the affected Facial Surface Area (expressed as the value between 0.0 to 1.0) being 4% of total Body Surface Area.

Percent change from baseline in central read F-VASI = ((post-baseline central read F-VASI - baseline central read F-VASI)/baseline central read F-VASI)×100. Negative percent change from baseline in F-VASI signified an improvement. Baseline was defined as the last measurement prior to Study Day 18.
