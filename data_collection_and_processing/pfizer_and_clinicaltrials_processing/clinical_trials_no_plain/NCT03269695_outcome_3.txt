Efficacy, Safety and Tolerability of PF-06687234 as Add-on Therapy to Infliximab in Active UC Subjects Not in Remission.
The Mayo score consists of 4 subscores (Endoscopic, stool frequency, rectal bleeding and Physician's global assessment [PGA]), each graded 0 to 3 with the higher score indicating more severe disease activity. Modified clinical remission is defined as a modified total Mayo Score (total Mayo score excluding the PGA subscore) with endoscopic subscore = 0 or 1 (where any friability was scored as a mayo endoscopic subscore of 2), stool frequency subscore = 0 or 1, and rectal bleeding subscore = 0. Participants with missing values were handled by treatment failure approach (participants who had missing value for any reasons were considered as treatment failures).
