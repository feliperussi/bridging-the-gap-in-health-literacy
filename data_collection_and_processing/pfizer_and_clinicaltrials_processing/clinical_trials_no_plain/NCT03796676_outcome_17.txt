JAK1 Inhibitor With Medicated Topical Therapy in Adolescents With Atopic Dermatitis
SCORAD is a validated scoring index for AD,which combines extent (0-100),severity (0-18),and subjective symptoms (0-20) based on pruritus and sleep loss,each scored (0-10). Extent,denoted as A,is measured by BSA affected by AD as a percentage of the whole BSA.The score for each body region is added up to determine A (maximum of 100).Severity, denoted as B,consists of the severity of several signs.Each is assessed as none(0),mild(1),moderate(2) or severe(3).The severity scores are added together to give B (maximum of 18).Subjective symptoms,denoted as C,are each scored by the participant using a NRS where "0" is no itch (or no sleeplessness) and "10" is the worst imaginable itch (or sleeplessness).These scores are added to give 'C' (maximum of 20).SCORAD for an individual is calculated by the formula: A/5 + 7B/2 + C (can range from 0 to 103).Higher values of SCORAD represent worse outcome.
