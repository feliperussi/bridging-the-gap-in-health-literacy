A Study of Talazoparib in Men With DNA Repair Defects and Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer
Best ORR was defined as the percentage of participants with best overall soft tissue response of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) as per RECIST1.1 by an independent central review. RECIST 1.1 criteria, CR: disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) must have reduction in short axis to less than 10 millimeter (mm). Disappearance of all non-target lesions and normalization of tumor marker level. All lymph nodes must be non-pathological in size (less than 10 mm short axis); PR: at least 30 percent (%) decrease in sum of diameters of target lesions taking as reference baseline sum diameters.
