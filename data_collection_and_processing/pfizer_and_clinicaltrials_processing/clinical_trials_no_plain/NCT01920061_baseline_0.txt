A Study Of PF-05212384 In Combination With Other Anti-Tumor Agents and in Combination With Cisplatin in Patients With Triple Negative Breast Cancer in an Expansion Arm (TNBC)
Participants with castrate resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), advanced breast cancer (ABC), or non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) that were candidates to treatment with a docetaxel-based combination. Each treatment cycle was defined as 21 days. Participants received intravenous infusion of PF-05212384 90 mg once on Day -7 and Cycle 1 Day 2, and docetaxel 75 mg/m2 1-hour IV infusion once on Cycle 1 Day 1. On Day 1 for Cycles 2 and beyond, participants received docetaxel 75 mg/m2 1-hour IV infusion once followed by PF-05212384 90 mg once. The maximum duration of PF-05212384 treatment was 505 days and the maximum duration of docetaxel treatment was 445 days.
