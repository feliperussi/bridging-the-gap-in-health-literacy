The sIGA Score 1 represented "Almost Clear" with the following descriptors:

Faint, barely detectable loss of pigmentation mainly located on dorsal hands, feet, bony prominences, and/or limited areas.
Approximately 90% pigmentation within lesions.
No or rare signs of Koebner phenomenon, confetti like or trichrome lesions could be present.
