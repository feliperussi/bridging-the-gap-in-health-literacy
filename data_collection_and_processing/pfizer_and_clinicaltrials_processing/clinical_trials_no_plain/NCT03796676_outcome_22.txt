JAK1 Inhibitor With Medicated Topical Therapy in Adolescents With Atopic Dermatitis
The DLQI is a general dermatology questionnaire that consists of 10 items to assess participant-reported health-related quality of life (daily activities, personal relationships, symptoms and feelings, leisure, work and school, and treatment).The DLQI is a psychometrically valid and reliable instrument that has been translated into several languages, and the DLQI total scores have been shown to be responsive to change. The minimally important difference for the DLQI has been estimated as a 3-5 point change from baseline. Each item is scored as "very much (3)", "a lot (2)", "a little (1)" and "not at all (0)". The score can range from 0 to 30. The higher values represent the worse dermatology life quality. Participants who withdrew from the study were counted as non-responder.
