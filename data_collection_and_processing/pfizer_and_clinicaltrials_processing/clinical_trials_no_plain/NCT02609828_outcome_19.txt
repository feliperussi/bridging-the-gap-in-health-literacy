Phase 3 Study on the Efficacy and Safety of Tanezumab in Patients With Cancer Pain Due to Bone Metastasis Who Are Taking Background Opioid Therapy
Orthostatic hypotension was defined as postural change (supine to standing) that met the following criteria: for systolic blood pressure (BP) less than or equal to (<=) 150 millimeter of mercury (mmHg) (mean supine): reduction in systolic BP >=20 mmHg or reduction in diastolic BP >=10 mmHg at the 1 and/or 3 minute standing BP measurements. For systolic BP greater than (>) 150 mmHg (mean supine): reduction in systolic BP >=30 mmHg or reduction in diastolic BP >=15 mmHg at the 1 and/or 3 minute standing BP measurements. If the 1 minute or 3 minute standing BP in a sequence met the orthostatic hypotension criteria, then that sequence was considered positive. If 2 of 2 or 2 of 3 sequences were positive, then orthostatic hypotension was considered confirmed.
