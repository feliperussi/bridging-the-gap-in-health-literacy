Avelumab in Previously Untreated Patients With Epithelial Ovarian Cancer (JAVELIN OVARIAN 100)
nAb against avelumab in serum samples was determined and reported separately for nAb never-positive and nAb ever-positive participants. Participants were considered nAb ever-positive if they had at least one positive nAb results (less than or equal to cut point of 0.710 in qualitative competitive ligand binding assay) at any time point during 36 months. nAb never-positive participants were those who had at least one negative nAb results (greater than cut point of 0.710 in qualitative competitive ligand binding assay) at any time point. Data for this outcome measure was not planned to be collected and analyzed for reporting arm "Chemotherapy followed by Observation", since, avelumab was not administered in this arm.
