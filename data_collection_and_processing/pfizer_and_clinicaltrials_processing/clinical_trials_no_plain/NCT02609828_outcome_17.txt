Change categories for sitting systolic blood pressure measured in millimeter of mercury (mm Hg) were as follows: change <=-40, change >-40 to -30, change >-30 to -20, change >-20 to -10, change >-10 to 0, change >0 to <10, change >=10 to <20, change >=20 to <30, change >=30 to <40 and change >=40. Change categories for sitting diastolic blood pressure measured in mm Hg were as follow: change <=-30, change >-30 to -20, change >-20 to -10, change >-10 to 0, change >0 to <10, change >=10 to <20, change >=20 to <30 and change >=30. Rows with only non-zero data/values, for at least 1 reporting arm, are reported below.
