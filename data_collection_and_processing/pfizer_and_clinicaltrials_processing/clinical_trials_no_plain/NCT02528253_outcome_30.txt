A Phase 3 Study of Tanezumab for Chronic Low Back Pain
EQ-5D-5L: standardized participant completed questionnaire that measures health-related quality of life and translates that score into an index value or utility score.EQ-5D-5L consists of 2 components: a health state profile and an optional VAS.EQ-5D health state profile comprises of 5 dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression.Individual dimension scores ranged from 1.0(least impairment of health state) to 5.0(most impairment of health state). Each dimension has 5 levels: 1=no problems, 2=slight problems, 3=moderate problems, 4=severe problems, and 5=extreme problems.Responses from five domains were used to calculate a single utility index (Overall health utility score) where values are less than equal to (<=) 1.Overall health utility score for a participant with no problems in all 5 items is 1 for all countries (except for Zimbabwe where it is 0.9), and reduced where participant reports greater levels of problems across five dimensions.
