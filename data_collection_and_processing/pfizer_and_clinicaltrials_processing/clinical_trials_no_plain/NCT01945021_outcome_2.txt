Phase II Safety and Efficacy Study of Crizotinib in East Asian Patients With ROS1 Positive, ALK Negative Advanced NSCLC
TTR was defined as the time from the date of first dose to first documentation of objective tumor response (CR or PR), that was subsequently confirmed. For participants proceeding from PR to CR, the onset of PR was taken as the onset of response. RECIST v1.1 (as determined by IRR), a) CR: disappearance of all target lesions. Disappearance of all non-target lesions and normalization of tumor marker level. All lymph nodes must be non-pathological in size (<10 mm short axis); b) PR: at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters.
