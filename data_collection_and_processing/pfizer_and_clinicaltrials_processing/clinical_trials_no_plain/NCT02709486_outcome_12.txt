Study of the Analgesic Efficacy and Safety of Subcutaneous Tanezumab in Subjects With Osteoarthritis of the Hip or Knee.
Percentage of participants with reduction in WOMAC physical function of at least (>=)30%,50%,70% and 90% at weeks 2,4,8,12,16,24 and 32 compared to baseline were classified as responders to WOMAC physical function subscale. WOMAC: Self-administered, disease-specific questionnaire which assesses clinically important, participant-relevant symptoms for pain, stiffness and physical function in participants with OA. Physical function:Participant's ability to move around and perform usual activities of daily living. WOMAC physical function subscale17-item questionnaire used to assess the degree of difficulty experienced due to OA in index joint (knee/hip) during past 48 hours, calculated as mean of the scores from 17 individual questions scored on a NRS. Scores for each question and WOMAC physical subscale on NRS ranged from 0 (no difficulty) to 10 (extreme difficulty), where higher scores indicated extreme difficulty/worse physical function. Missing data was imputed using mixed BOCF/LOCF.
