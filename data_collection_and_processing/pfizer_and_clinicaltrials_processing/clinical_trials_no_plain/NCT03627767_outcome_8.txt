Study to Investigate Efficacy and Safety of PF-04965842 in Subjects Aged 12 Years and Over With Moderate to Severe Atopic Dermatitis With the Option of Rescue Treatment in Flaring Subjects
4 body regions evaluated: head and neck, upper limbs, trunk (including axillae, groin/genitals), lower limbs (including buttocks) excluding scalp, palms, soles. BSA calculated by handprint method. Number (No) of handprints (size of participant's hand with fingers in closed position) fitting in affected area of a body region was estimated. Maximum No of handprints were 10, 20, 30, 40 for head and neck, upper limbs, trunk, and lower limbs respectively. Surface area (SA) of body region equivalent to 1 handprint: 1 handprint=10% for head and neck, 5% for upper limbs, 3.33% for trunk and 2.5% for lower limbs. %Change BSA for a body region was calculated as=total No of handprints in a body region* %SA equivalent to 1 handprint. %BSA for an individual: arithmetic mean of %BSA of all 4 body regions, ranged from 0-100%, higher values=greater AD severity.
