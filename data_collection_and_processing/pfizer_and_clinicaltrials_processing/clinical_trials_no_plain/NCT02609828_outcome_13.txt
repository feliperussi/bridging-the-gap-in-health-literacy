Phase 3 Study on the Efficacy and Safety of Tanezumab in Patients With Cancer Pain Due to Bone Metastasis Who Are Taking Background Opioid Therapy
OR-SDS: questionnaire evaluated opioid-related 12 symptoms. For each symptom, participants assigned integer scores to assess severity (none =0 to very severe =4), distress (none =0 to very much =5), and frequency (none =0 to almost constantly =4; participants reported number of retching/vomiting episodes (none =0, 1-2 episodes =1, 3-4 episodes =2, 5-6 episodes =3, >6 episodes =4). Frequency composite score: mean of frequency scores from all symptoms, ranged from 0 (none) to 4 (almost constantly); higher scores = worse condition. Severity composite score: mean of severity scores from all 12 symptoms, ranged from 0 (none) to 4 (maximum severity); higher scores = worse condition. Distress composite score: mean of distress scores from all 12 symptoms, ranged from 0 (none) to 5 (maximum distress); higher scores = worse condition. Multi domain average (MDA): average of each symptom for frequency, severity, and distress; ranged from 0 (none) to 4.34 (worse); higher scores = worse condition.
