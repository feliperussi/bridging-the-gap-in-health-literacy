Efficacy and Safety of Tofacitinib in Subjects With Active Ankylosing Spondylitis (AS)
The WPAI assesses work productivity and impairment. It is a 6-item questionnaire used to assess the degree to which Ankylosing Spondylitis affected work productivity and regular activities over the past 7 days. The questions are as follows: Q1 = currently employed; Q2 = hours missed due to health problems; Q3 = hours missed due to other reasons; Q4 = hours actually worked; Q5 = degree health affected productivity while working (0-10 scale, with higher numbers indicating less productivity); Q6 = degree health affected regular activities (0-10 scale, with higher numbers indicating greater impairment of regular activities). Percent Impairment while Working due to Health Problem was a subscale and calculated as: Q5/10 for those who were currently employed and actually worked in the past 7 days. Subscale score was expressed as an impairment percentage (range: 0-100%) where higher numbers indicate greater impairment and less productivity.
