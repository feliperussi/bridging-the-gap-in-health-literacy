Safety And Efficacy Evaluation Of Fx-1006a In Patients With V122i Or Wild-Type Transthyretin (TTR) Amyloid Cardiomyopathy
6MWT is a sub-maximal exercise test used to assess aerobic capacity and endurance. Participants were asked to walk as far as possible for 6 minutes at a pace that was comfortable to them, and were permitted to slow down, to stop, and to rest as necessary. Dyspnea: participants were asked to rate the difficulty of their breathing, pre-walk and post-walk at each visit, on a scale of range 0 (no breathlessness at all) to 10 (maximum breathlessness). Higher scores indicated more severity. Fatigue: participants were asked to rate the how tired they felt, pre-walk and post-walk at each visit, on a scale of range 0 (not at all) to 10 (maximal) Higher scores indicated more fatigue. At each visit, scores for pre-walk test, post-walk test and within visit difference (difference from post-walk to pre-walk) were evaluated. Change from baseline was calculated for each pre-walk test, post-walk test and within visit difference at Month 12.
