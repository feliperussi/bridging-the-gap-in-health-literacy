Safety Study Of Tofacitinib Versus Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF) Inhibitor In Subjects With Rheumatoid Arthritis
ACR50 response is a >= 50% improvement in TJC (28) and SJC (28) and >=50% improvement in 3 of the 5 remaining ACR-core criteria: 1) PGA of arthritis, 2) PtGA of arthritis, 3) participant's assessment of arthritis pain, 4) participant's assessment of functional disability by HAQ-DI, and 5) CRP (mg/L) at each visit. PGA: physician's global assessment of arthritis on VAS, 0 (very well) to 100 mm (worst arthritis), higher scores=worse condition. PtGA: participant's global assessment of arthritis on VAS, 0 mm (very well) to 100 mm (worst arthritis condition), higher scores = worse condition. Participant's assessment of arthritis pain: assessed on VAS, 0 mm (no pain) to 100 mm (most severe pain), higher score = more pain. HAQ-DI: functional disability evaluation, score: 0 (no difficulty) to 3 (unable to do), higher score=more disability.
