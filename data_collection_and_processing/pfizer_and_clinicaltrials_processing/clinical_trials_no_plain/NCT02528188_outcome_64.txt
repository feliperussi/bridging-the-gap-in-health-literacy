Long Term Safety and Efficacy Study of Tanezumab in Subjects With Osteoarthritis of the Hip or Knee
The LEAS is a self-administered scale to assess activity level in participants having total knee arthroplasty. The LEAS scale reflected four levels of lower-extremity activity (1)housebound(unable to walk or a minimal ability to walk) (2)more ordinary walking about the house (3)walking about the community (4)walking about the community as well as substantial work or exercise. It consisted of 12 questions resulting in 18-level scale that allowed participants to select a single description that most represented his or her self-perceived activity level. The final score was simply the number of the descriptor selected by the participant as being most representative of his or her activity level. The minimum possible score was 1(entirely bedbound) and the maximum possible score was 18(currently competitive athlete). Higher score indicated increased activity. Categorical changes from baseline were reported in terms of improvement (Change >0), No change and worsening (Change less than [<] 0).
