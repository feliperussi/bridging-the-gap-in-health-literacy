A Double-blind Study to Assess 2 Doses of an Investigational Product for 16 Weeks in Participants With Non-alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease and Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus
An adverse event (AE) was any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study participant, temporally associated with the use of study intervention, whether or not considered related to the study intervention. A serious AE was any untoward medical occurrence at any dose that resulted in death; was life-threatening; required hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization; resulted in persistent or significant disability/incapacity; resulted in congenital anomaly/birth defect or that was considered to be an important medical event. An AE was considered TEAE if the event occurred during the on-treatment period. The causality of AEs were assessed by the investigator using clinical judgement. A severe AE was an event that prevents normal everyday activities.
