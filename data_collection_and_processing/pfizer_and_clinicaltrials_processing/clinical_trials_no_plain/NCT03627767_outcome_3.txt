Study to Investigate Efficacy and Safety of PF-04965842 in Subjects Aged 12 Years and Over With Moderate to Severe Atopic Dermatitis With the Option of Rescue Treatment in Flaring Subjects
EASI quantifies severity of participant's AD (excluded scalp, palms, soles) based on severity of AD clinical signs and % of BSA affected. Severity of clinical signs of AD (erythema [E], induration/papulation [I], excoriation [Ex] and lichenification [L]) was scored separately for each of 4 body regions (head and neck [h], upper limbs [u], trunk [t] [including axillae and groin] and lower limbs [l] [including buttocks]) on 4-point scale: 0 = absent; 1 = mild; 2 = moderate; 3 = severe. EASI area score was based upon % BSA with AD in body region: 0 (0%), 1 (>0 to <10%), 2 (10 to <30%), 3 (30 to <50%), 4 (50 to <70%), 5 (70 to <90%) and 6 (90 to 100%). Total EASI score = 0.1*Ah*(Eh+Ih+Exh+Lh) + 0.2*Au*(Eu+Iu+ExU+Lu) + 0.3*At*(Et+It+Ext+Lt) + 0.4*Al*(El+Il+Exl+Ll); where A = area score. Total EASI score ranged from 0.0 to 72.0, higher scores = greater severity of AD.
