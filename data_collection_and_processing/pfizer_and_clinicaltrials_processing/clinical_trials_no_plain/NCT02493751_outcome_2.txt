An SAE was an AE resulting in any of the following outcomes or deemed significant for any other reason: death; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; life-threatening experience; persistent or significant disability/incapacity; congenital anomaly. AEs were graded by worst NCI CTCAE v4.03 severity grade. Grade 3 events=unacceptable or intolerable events, significantly interrupting usual daily activity, require systemic drug therapy/other treatment. Grade 4 events caused participant to be in imminent danger of death. Grade 5 events=death related to an AE. Treatment-related AEs and SAEs were determined by the investigator.
