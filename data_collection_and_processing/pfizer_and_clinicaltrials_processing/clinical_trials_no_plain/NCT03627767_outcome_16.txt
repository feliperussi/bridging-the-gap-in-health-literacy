Study to Investigate Efficacy and Safety of PF-04965842 in Subjects Aged 12 Years and Over With Moderate to Severe Atopic Dermatitis With the Option of Rescue Treatment in Flaring Subjects
4 body regions were evaluated: head and neck, upper limbs, trunk (including axillae and groin/genitals) and lower limbs (including buttocks). Scalp, palms and soles were excluded. BSA was calculated using handprint method. Number of handprints (size of participant's hand with fingers in a closed position) fitting in affected area of a body region was estimated. Maximum number of handprints were 10 for head and neck, 20 for upper limbs, 30 for trunk and 40 for lower limbs. Surface area of body region equivalent to 1 handprint: 1 handprint was equal to 10% for head and neck, 5% for upper limbs, 3.33% for trunk and 2.5% for lower limbs. Overall % BSA for an individual % BSA of all 4 body regions, ranged from 0 to 100%, with higher values representing greater severity of AD.
