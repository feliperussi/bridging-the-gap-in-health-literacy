Safety and Efficacy Study of Enzalutamide Versus Bicalutamide in Men With Prostate Cancer
Duration of radiographic PFS was defined as the time from randomization to the earliest objective evidence of radiographic disease progression or death on study and was to be evaluated for participants with metastatic disease at study entry. Radiographic disease progression in bone was based on PCWG2 guidelines defined as at least 2 new lesions on bone scan. Radiographic disease progression in soft tissue on CT/MRI was based on RECIST 1.1. CT/MRI and bone scans were read locally by the same radiologist (or nuclear medicine physician for interpretation of bone scans) whenever possible. Participants not known to have had radiographic progression at the time of analysis data cutoff were censored at the date of last radiographic assessment.
