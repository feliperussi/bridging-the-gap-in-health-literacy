Efficacy and Safety of Tofacitinib in Subjects With Active Ankylosing Spondylitis (AS)
BASDAI was a validated questionnaire that consisted of 6 questions pertaining to the 5 major symptoms of AS: fatigue; spinal pain; peripheral arthritis; enthesitis, intensity of morning stiffness and duration of morning stiffness. Each question was rated using a numerical rating scale from 0 (none) to 10 (very severe), higher score=high disease activity. BASDAI score was calculated by computing mean of questions 5 and 6 and adding it to sum of questions 1 to 4. This score was then divided by 5. The total BASDAI score was ranged from 0= none to 10= very severe, where higher score indicated high disease activity. BASDAI50 response was defined as decrease of >=50% from Baseline in BASDAI score at specified time points. Percentage of participants with BASDAI 50 response at specified weeks are reported.
