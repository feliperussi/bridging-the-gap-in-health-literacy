PF-06651600 for the Treatment of Alopecia Areata
The exposure response of Ritlecitinib (PF-06651600) on the regrowth of scalp hair was characterized using a Bayesian three-parameter hyperbolic Emax model for the SALT score <=10 at Week 24 with an additional term for effect of loading dose. In Emax exposure-response model the response function was the log odds of the percentage of participants with response based on SALT <=10 at Week 24, which was fit on the logistic scale and then back-transformed to percentage. The effect of loading dose is included as fixed factor in the model. The variable that represents loading dose has values of 1 for groups 200/50 mg once daily and 200/30 mg once daily and of 0 for the remaining groups. SALT is a quantitative assessment of AA severity based on the scalp hair loss. The SALT score can vary from 0 (normal) to 100 (severe), with higher scores representing increased severity of disease.
