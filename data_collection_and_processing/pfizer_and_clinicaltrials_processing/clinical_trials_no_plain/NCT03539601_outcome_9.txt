A Study of Crisaborole Ointment 2%; Crisaborole Vehicle; TCS and TCI in Subjects Aged â‰¥ 2 Years, With Mild-moderate AD
Four body regions were evaluated: head and neck, upper limbs, trunk (including axillae) and lower limbs (including buttocks) excluding scalp. BSA was calculated using handprint method. Number of handprints (size of participant's full palmer hand in a closed position) fitting in affected area of a body region was estimated. Maximum number of handprints were: 10 for head, neck (20 for <8 years age), 20 for upper limbs, 30 for trunk, 40 for lower limbs (30 for <8 years age). Surface area (SA) of body region equivalent to 1 handprint: 10% for head, neck (5% for <8 years age), 5% for upper limbs, 3.33% for trunk, 2.5% for lower limbs (3.33% for <8 years age). Overall %BSA for a body region = total number of handprints in a body region * % SA equivalent to 1 handprint. % BSA for an individual: mean of % BSA of all 4 body regions, range =0-100%, higher values = greater AD severity.
