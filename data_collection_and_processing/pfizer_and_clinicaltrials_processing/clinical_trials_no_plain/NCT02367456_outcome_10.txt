A Combination Study of PF-04449913 (Glasdegib) and Azacitidine In Untreated MDS, AML and CMML Patients
Number of participants with PR, marrow CR (mCR), SD, complete or partial cytogenetic response, and hematologic improvement (HI). PR: BMB >5% and decreased by ≥50% (at least 4 weeks), meeting all CR criteria if abnormal before treatment except BMB. mCR: BMB ≤5% and decreased by ≥50%. SD: failure to achieve PR, no evidence of progression. Complete or partial cytogenic response: disappearance of chromosomal abnormality without new ones, or ≥ 50% reduction of chromosomal abnormality. HI: erythroid response (pretreatment <11g/dL): hemoglobin increase by≥1.5 g/dL, relevant reduction of units of red blood cell transfusions by at least 4 transfusions/8 weeks compared to pretreatment transfusion number in previous 8 weeks; platelet response (pretreatment <1x10^11/L): increase of ≥30x10^9/L if starting with >20x10^9/L, and increase from <20x10^9/L to >20x10^9/L and by at least 100%; neutrophil response (pretreatment <1x10^9/L): at least a 100% increase, absolute increase >0.5x10^9/L.
