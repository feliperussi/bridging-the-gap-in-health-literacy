Fragmin for the Treatment of Acute VTE in Pediatric Cancer Patients
It was defined as the time interval (in days) between date of first study treatment and date of documentation of first VTE. VTEs included both DVT and PE. DVT is a blood clot in the deep veins of the leg. If a DVT clot breaks off from a vein wall and flows towards the lungs and blocks some or all of the blood supply, it becomes PE. When a blood clot breaks, loose and travels in the blood, this is called VTE. VTE was confirmed by at least one radiographic test and was defined as any new or progressive VTE whose signs and symptoms (identified by the investigator) included: objective swelling or tenderness, pitting edema, erythema or cyanosis.
