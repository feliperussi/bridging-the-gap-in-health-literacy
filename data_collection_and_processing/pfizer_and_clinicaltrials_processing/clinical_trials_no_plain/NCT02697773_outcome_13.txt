WOMAC: self-administered, disease-specific questionnaire which assesses clinically important, participant-relevant symptoms for pain, stiffness and physical function in participants with osteoarthritis. Physical function: participant's ability to move around and perform usual activities of daily living. WOMAC physical function subscale: 17-item questionnaire used to assess the degree of difficulty experienced due to osteoarthritis in index joint (knee or hip) during past 48 hours, calculated as mean of the scores from 17 individual questions scored on a NRS of 0 (minimum difficulty) to 10 (extreme difficulty),higher scores indicate extreme difficulty/worse physical function. Percentage of participants with cumulative reduction (as percent) (greater than 0 %; >= 10 %, 20 %, 30 %, 40 %, 50 %, 60 %, 70 %, 80 % and 90%; = 100 %) in WOMAC physical function subscale from Baseline to Week 16 were reported. Missing data was imputed using mixed BOCF/LOCF.
