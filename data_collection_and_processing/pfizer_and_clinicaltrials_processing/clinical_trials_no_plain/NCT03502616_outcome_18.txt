Efficacy and Safety of Tofacitinib in Subjects With Active Ankylosing Spondylitis (AS)
BASMI assessed axial status and spinal mobility, using linear function. It composed of 5 clinical measures: lateral spinal flexion, tragus-to-wall distance, lumbar flexion (modified Schober), maximal intermalleolar distance, cervical rotation. BASMI - Linear Method score was average of 5 individual component scores mapped between 0 and 10, with higher scores indicating more impairment of axial status and spinal mobility. For the assessment of tragus-to-wall distance, participant was placed standing with his/her back against the wall; knees straight; scapulae, buttocks, and heels against wall; and head in as neutral position as possible. The distance between the tragus and wall in cm was measured (to the nearest 0.1 cm) from both the right side and left side at the maximum effort to touch the head against the wall. Distance should be greater than or equal to 0 cm with no defined maximum value, lower tragus-to-wall value indicates better health status.
