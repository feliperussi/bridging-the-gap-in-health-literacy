Long Term Safety and Efficacy Study of Tanezumab in Subjects With Osteoarthritis of the Hip or Knee
Percentage of participants with reduction in WOMAC physical function of >=(30%,50%,70%,90%) at Weeks 2,4,8,16,24,32,40,48,56 and 64 compared to baseline were classified as responders to WOMAC physical function subscale. WOMAC: Self-administered, disease-specific questionnaire which assesses clinically important, participant-relevant symptoms for pain, stiffness and physical function in participants with OA. Physical function:Participant's ability to move around and perform usual activities of daily living. WOMAC physical function subscale17-item questionnaire used to assess the degree of difficulty experienced due to OA in index joint (knee/hip) during past 48 hours, calculated as mean of the scores from 17 individual questions scored on a NRS. Scores for each question and WOMAC physical subscale on NRS ranged from 0 (no difficulty) to 10 (extreme difficulty), where higher scores indicated extreme difficulty/worse physical function. Missing data was imputed using mixed BOCF/LOCF.
