Avelumab in Previously Untreated Patients With Epithelial Ovarian Cancer (JAVELIN OVARIAN 100)
In CP, based on investigator's decision, participants received either: paclitaxel 175 mg/m2, IV infusion, followed by carboplatin dose at AUC 5 or 6, IV infusion (carboplatin dose [milligrams](mg) = Target AUC [milligrams*minute per milliliter] (mg*min/mL) x GFR mL/min + 25), and maximum carboplatin dose = target AUC x (150 mL/min) on Day 1 of Cycles 1 to 6; or Paclitaxel 80 mg/m2 IV infusion over 1 hour on Days 1, 8, and 15, along with carboplatin dose at AUC 5 or 6, IV infusion over 1 hour on Day 1 of Cycle 1 to 6. Each cycle was of 21 days (3 weeks). After completion of CP, participants were followed for survival status until death or until study completion, whichever was earlier or a maximum duration of 24 months in observation phase. Participants were then followed up to a maximum of 36 months.
