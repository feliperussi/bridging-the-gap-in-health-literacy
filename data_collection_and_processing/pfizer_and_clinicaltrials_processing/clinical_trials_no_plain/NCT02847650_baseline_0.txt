Efficacy, Safety and Tolerability of PF-06649751 in Parkinson's Disease Patients at Early Stage of the Disease
Eligible participants were up-titrated in a double-blind fashion to an optimal dose level of PF-06649751 according to a flexible dose titration scheme (from 0.25 mg to 15 mg once daily [QD]). The 15-week treatment period included 9 weeks of dose optimization and 6 weeks of stable dosing. Blinded PF-06649751 was provided as tablets for oral administration in the outpatient setting (each morning, daily for the duration of the treatment period). Reaching of the maximum allowed dose level (15 mg) was not mandatory; participants might achieve a satisfactory clinical response at a lower dose level. There was an additional follow-up period of 28 days following discontinuation of PF-06649751.
