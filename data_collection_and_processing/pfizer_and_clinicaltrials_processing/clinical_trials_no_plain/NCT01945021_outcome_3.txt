Phase II Safety and Efficacy Study of Crizotinib in East Asian Patients With ROS1 Positive, ALK Negative Advanced NSCLC
DCR at 8 weeks was defined as the percentage of participants with a confirmed CR, confirmed PR, or stable disease (SD) at 8 weeks, respectively, relative to the total population of response evaluable participants. RECIST v1.1 (as determined by IRR), a) CR: disappearance of all target lesions. Disappearance of all non-target lesions and normalization of tumor marker level. All lymph nodes must be non-pathological in size (<10 mm short axis); b) PR: at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters. SD: neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum diameters while on study.
