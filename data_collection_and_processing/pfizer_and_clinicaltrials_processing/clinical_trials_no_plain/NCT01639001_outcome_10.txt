A Study Of Crizotinib Versus Chemotherapy In Previously Untreated ALK Positive East Asian Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Patients
The QLQ-LC13 consisted of 1 multi-item scale and 9 single items that assessed the specific symptoms (dyspnea, cough, hemoptysis, and site specific pain), side effects (sore mouth, dysphagia, neuropathy, and alopecia), and pain medication use of lung cancer participants receiving chemotherapy. The QLQ-LC13 Coughing, Dyspnoea and Pain in chest each ranged from 0-100 with higher scores indicating a high level of symptomatology/problems. TTD in pain in chest, dyspnea, or cough from the QLQ-LC13 was a composite endpoint defined as the time from randomization to the earliest time the participant's scale scores showed a 10 point or greater increase after baseline in any of the 3 symptoms.
