Avelumab in Previously Untreated Patients With Epithelial Ovarian Cancer (JAVELIN OVARIAN 100)
Ctrough is the concentration at the end of the dosing interval when avelumab was given as a Q2W regimen in the absence of carboplatin and paclitaxel following 1 cycle of avelumab dosing, i.e. before administration of drug on Day 1 of cycle 2. The LLQ of avelumab was 0.20 mcg/mL. Data for this outcome measure was not reported for reporting arms "PK: Chemotherapy followed by Avelumab" (data not available for this OM as avelumab was not given along with paclitaxel and carboplatin in this arm) and "PK: Chemotherapy followed by Observation" (since avelumab was not administered in this arm and therefore data collection was not planned).
