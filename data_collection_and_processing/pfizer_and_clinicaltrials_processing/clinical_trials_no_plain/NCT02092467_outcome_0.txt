Safety Study Of Tofacitinib Versus Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF) Inhibitor In Subjects With Rheumatoid Arthritis
Incidence rate (number of participants with event per 100 participant year [PY]) was defined as the total number of participants with admissible events divided by the total (for all qualifying participants) time at risk for the cohort/treatment group of interest. Malignancy events, excluding NMSC were adjudicated by a steering committee. The risk period (RP) was the last contact date. The last contact date was the maximum of (AE start date, AE stop date, last study visit date, withdrawal date, telephone contact date). If a participant died, last contact date was the death date. First events were counted within the RP. If a participant did not have an event or had an event but outside the risk period, the participant was censored at the end of RP.
