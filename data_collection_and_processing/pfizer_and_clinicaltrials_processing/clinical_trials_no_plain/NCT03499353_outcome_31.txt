Talazoparib For Neoadjuvant Treatment Of Germline BRCA1/2 Mutation Patients With Early Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2 Negative Breast Cancer
EORTC QLQ-C30 is a 30-item cancer-specific instrument that assesses participant reported outcomes, consisting of 5 functional scales, 3 symptoms scales, a GHS/QoL scale, and 6 single-item scales. The GHS/QoL scale has 7 possible scores of responses (1=very poor to 7=excellent). All other items have 4 possible scores (1=not at all, 2=a little, 3=quite a bit, 4=very much). A linear transformation was applied to the raw scores so that all transformed scores lie between 0 to 100, with 0 being the worst and 100 being the best for GHS/QoL and functional scales, and 0 being the best and 100 being the worst for symptoms scales.

For the GHS/QoL scale, participants rated their overall health and quality of life within the past week. Negative change from baseline indicates deterioration in GHS/QoL and positive change indicates improvement.
