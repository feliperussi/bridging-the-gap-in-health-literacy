Safety and Immunogenicity of 20vPnC Coadministered With SIIV in Adults â‰¥65 Years of Age
Local reactions were collected at the 20vPnC injection sites after Vaccination 1 and Vaccination 2 and were recorded by the participants using an electronic diary (e-diary). Local reactions included redness, swelling and pain at the injection site. Redness and swelling were measured and recorded in measuring device units. 1 measuring device unit =0.5 centimeter (cm). Redness and swelling were graded as mild (greater than [>] 2.0 to 5.0 cm), moderate (>5.0 to 10.0 cm) and severe (>10.0 cm). Pain at injection site was graded as mild (did not interfere with activity), moderate (interfered with activity), and severe (prevented daily activity). Percentage of participants with local reactions at the 20vPnC injection site in the Coadministration group and the Separate administration group and the associated 2-sided 95% confidence interval (CI) based on the Clopper and Pearson method was presented.
