A Study Of PF-06463922 An ALK/ROS1 Inhibitor In Patients With Advanced Non Small Cell Lung Cancer With Specific Molecular Alterations
DLT was defined as any of the following adverse events (AEs) attributable to PF-06463922: (1) hematologic: grade 4 neutropenia for >7 days; febrile neutropenia; grade >=3 neutropenic infection; grade >=3 thrombocytopenia with bleeding; grade 4 thrombocytopenia; (2) non-hematologic: grade >=3 pancreatitis; grade >=3 toxicities (excluding grade >=3 laboratory abnormalities not requiring dose modifications) persisting after optimal treatment with standard medical therapy; symptomatic grade >=3 QTc prolongation, or asymptomatic grade >=3 prolongation that had been confirmed by repeat testing and re-evaluation by a qualified person, and persisted after correction of reversible causes; >=20% decrease from baseline in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF); (3) other: failure to deliver at least 16 out of the 21 prescribed daily total doses due to toxicities attributable to study drug; failure to restart dosing after 21 days (1 cycle) delay due to toxicities attributable to study drug.
