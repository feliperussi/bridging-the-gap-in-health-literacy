Chemistry laboratory parameters: Blood urea nitrogen (BUN), Total protein, Chloride, Cancer antigen 19-9 (CA 19-9), Brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), Bicarbonate, Direct bilirubin, Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), Uric acid, Troponin I. Thyroid panel laboratory parameters: Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), Free triiodothyronine (T3), Free thyroxine (T4). Laboratory values were as per laboratory normal ranges. Values above range were reported as high and values below range as low.
