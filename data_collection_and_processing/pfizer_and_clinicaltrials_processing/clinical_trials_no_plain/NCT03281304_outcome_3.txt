A Study of Tofacitinib in Patients With Ulcerative Colitis in Stable Remission
Remission as per total mayo score was defined by a total mayo score of 2 points or lower, with no individual subscore exceeding 1 point and a rectal bleeding subscore of 0. Mayo score is an instrument designed to measure disease activity of UC. It consisted of 4 subscores: stool frequency, rectal bleeding, findings of flexible sigmoidoscopy and physician global assessment (PGA), each subscore graded from 0 to 3 with higher scores indicating more severe disease. PGA included 3 criteria: participant's recollection of abdominal discomfort, general sense of wellbeing and other observations such as physical findings and performance status. Individual subscores were summed up to give a total mayo score range of 0 to 12, where higher scores indicating more severe disease.
