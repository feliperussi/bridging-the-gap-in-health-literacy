A Study Of PF-05212384 In Combination With Other Anti-Tumor Agents and in Combination With Cisplatin in Patients With Triple Negative Breast Cancer in an Expansion Arm (TNBC)
This study will evaluate PF-05212384 (gedatolisib) PI3K/mTOR inhibitor)) in combination with either docetaxel, cisplatin or dacomitinib in select advanced solid tumors. The study will assess the safety, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of these combinations in patients with advanced cancer in order to determine the maximum tolerated dose in each combination. The cisplatin combination expansion portion will evaluate the anti tumor activity of PF 05212384 plus cisplatin in patients with TNBC in 2 separate Arms (Arm 1 and Arm 2).
