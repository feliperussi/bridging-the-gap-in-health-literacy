Atopic dermatitis is a common skin condition that can cause many symptoms, such as 
itching, redness, and a rash that is scaling or oozing.  The symptoms can look 
different on different people.  Atopic dermat itis is also known as eczema.  There is no 
known cure for this condition. People with atopic dermatitis often have this 
condition for many years, and may have “flare ups”, when their symptoms worsen for 
a time.
Researchers are looking for treatments for atopic dermatitis.  Crisaborole is a 
medicine that is used to treat atopic dermatitis. It is applied to the skin as an 
ointment.  Crisaborole may improve symptoms of atopic dermatitis by decreasing 
inflammation i n the skin.  Inflammation is the body’s immune system response, which 
can lead to symptoms such as redness.
The main goal of this study was to learn more about how crisaborole works by taking 
skin samples to analyze for “biomarkers”, which are special subs tances in the skin 
related to inflammation.   Researchers wanted to answer these main questions: 
Did atopic dermatitis “biomarkers” change in areas of skin that were treated 
with crisaborole, compared to areas of skin that were treated with pla in 
ointment ?
Did symptoms of atopic dermatitis improve in areas of skin that were treated 
with crisaborole, compared to areas of skin that were treated with plain 
ointment?
