Parkinson’s disease i s a disease of the nervous system that affects movement.  Patients 
with Parkinson’s disease can have many symptoms, such as weakness, tremor, stiff 
muscles, and slowed movements.  These are known as “motor symptoms.”  The 
symptoms of Parkinson’s disease us ually develop slowly over several years. 
Doctors aren’t sure exactly what causes Parkinson’s disease, but it occurs when certain 
nerve cells in the brain die.  These nerve cells are found in the part of the brain that 
controls movement, and they make a ch emical called “dopamine.”  Many medicines 
used to treat Parkinson’s disease work by increasing the amount of dopamine in the 
brain, which could help decrease Parkinson’s symptoms.
PF-06649751 was studied as a possible treatment for Parkinson’s disease.  Th e main 
goal of this study was to learn more about the use of PF-06649751 in patients with 
Parkinson’s disease who were at an early stage of the disease.  Researchers wanted to 
answer this question:
Did motor symptoms decrease in patients who received PF-06649751 , 
compared to patients who received placebo?
A placebo does not have any medicine in it, but looks just like the medicine.
