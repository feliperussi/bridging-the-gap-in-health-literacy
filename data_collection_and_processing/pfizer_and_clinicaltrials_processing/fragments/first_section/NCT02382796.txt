Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the most common type of lung cancer.  In 
some patients with NSCLC, their cancer cells have changes (mutations) in the gene 
that makes a protein called epidermal growth factor receptor, or “EGFR”.  These 
mutations in EGFR help stimulate cancer cells to grow and multiply.  Researchers are 
looking for better trea tments for patients with NSCLC whose cancer cells have 
mutations in the EGFR gene.
Dacomitinib (Vizimpro®) is a medicine that has been approved in the United States, 
Japan and European Union as treatment for patients with NSCLC.  At the time of 
this study, dacomitinib was not yet approved for treatment of patients with NSCLC.  
Dacomitinib works by blocking the activity of a group of proteins called the human 
epidermal growth factor receptor (HER) family (including EGFR [also known as 
HER1], HER2, and HER4).   These are proteins on the surface of cells that can 
stimulate cancer cells to grow and multiply.  By blocking the activity of these proteins 
dacomitinib may be able to help limit the growth and spread of cancer cells.  
Dacomitinib is given as a tablet on ce a day to be taken by mouth.
The purpose of this study was to provide continued access to dacomitinib for patients 
who participated in other dacomitinib studies in Japan and would be deemed to derive 
benefit from continued dacomitinib treatment.
Research ers also wanted to learn more about the safety of dacomitinib.  They 
monitored the patients for any medical problems that happened while they were in 
the study.
