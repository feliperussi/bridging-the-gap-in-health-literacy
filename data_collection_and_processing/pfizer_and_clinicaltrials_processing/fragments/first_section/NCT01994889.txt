People with t ransthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy have higher than normal levels of a 
particular protein in their heart .  This increases the risk o f having heart problems ,like
heart failure.
Tafam idis is a study drug that is being tested for the treatment of transthyretin 
amyloid cardiomyopathy . Tafamidis is currently approved to treat transthyretin 
amyloid cardiomyopathy in Japan and the United States . Tafamidis is not approved to 
treat transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy in other countries because it is still being 
tested.
Thisstudy had 2 purposes:
To understand the safety of tafamidis : to see what medical problems patient s
had during the stu dy
To look at controlling transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy : to see if patients 
taking tafamidis were less likely to have a stay in hospital and less likely to die 
earlier because of transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy
