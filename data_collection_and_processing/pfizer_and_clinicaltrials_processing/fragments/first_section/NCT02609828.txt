What are “bone metastasis” and “metastatic bone pain”?
“Bone metastasis” happens when cancer has spread from its original site to a bone.  
Bone metastasis is the most common cause of cancer pain.
“Metastatic bone pain” happens when bone metastasis causes pain.  Metastatic bone 
pain is called MBP.
What is tanezumab?
Tanezumab is astudy medicine that has not been approved for use in patients.  
Researchers think it could help lessen MBP. Tanezumab was injected under the skin
using a needle .
What was the purpose of this study?
Researchers wanted to know:
Did tanezumab help participants lessen MBP?
MBP can last for a long time and has a negative impact on well -being. While there are 
treatments for cancer pain, good control of MBP remains a challenge .
Patients who have MBP may need to take “opioids.”   Opioids are a kind of medicine 
for pain relief .  They are given for pain that is rated as medium to wors t.  But, opioids 
alone may give poor control of MBP.
Researchers wanted to learn if tanezumab could lessen MBP in participants who were 
taking opioids.
