Rheumatoid arthritis, or RA, is a disease that causes swelling, pain, and stiffness in the 
joints.  RA is an autoimmune disease, which means that patients with RA have an 
overactive immune system that mistakenly attacks healthy parts of the body, such as 
the joints.  RA can cause permanent damage to th e joints if it goes unchecked . 
There are medicines that can be used to treat RA.  One medicine that is approved for 
treatment of RA  is called HUMIRA® (in this document HUMIRA® is also called  
adalimumab) .  Adalimumab may help calm the activity of the immune  system and 
decrease RA symptoms.  
PF-06410293 is a new medicine being studied for RA.  PF -06410293 was made to be 
similar to adalimumab.  The reason for making a drug that is similar to adalimumab is 
to help give patients access to  another treatment option .    
This main purpose of this study was to learn more about using PF -06410293 to treat 
RA, compared to adalimumab , and to determine if the 2 medicines are similar .  The 
researchers wanted to answer this question:  
• How many patients who took PF-06410293  had at least 
20% improvement in RA symptoms at week 12 of the study, compared 
to patients who took adalimumab?
