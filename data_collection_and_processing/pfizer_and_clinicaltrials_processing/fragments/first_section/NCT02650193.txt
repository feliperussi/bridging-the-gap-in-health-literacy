A “neutrophil” is a type of white blood cell that fights infections in the body. Certain 
chemotherapy medicines that are used for trea ting cancer can cause t he number of 
neutrophils in the body to be too low.  This is known as “chemotherapy -induced 
neutropenia”, or CIN.  Patients with CIN are at increased risk for fever and serious 
infections.
There are medicines that can be used to treat CIN .  One medicine that is use d is 
called Neulasta®.  Neul asta may increase the number of neutrophils in the blood .
This study was designed to study a new medicine being developed for CIN.  This 
medicine is called HSP -130 (PF -06881894), and it is similar to Neulasta. The r eason 
for studying HSP -130 is to give patients another treatment option. HSP-130 is still 
being studied and has not been approved for use outside of clinical studies.
Forthis study, researchers were interested in learn ing how HSP -130 affects the body , 
when given as a single dose or as multiple doses. This information is important to 
help determine the right dose of HSP -130.  The study was for women with breast 
cancer that ha dnot spread to other parts of the body .  It was divided into 2 parts.  In
the first part of the study, researchers wanted to answer this question:
What effect did HSP -130 have on the number of neutrophils in 
patients’ blood , if they were not getting chemotherapy ?
For the second part of the study, researchers wanted to answer this question:
How many days did patients have s everely low neutrophil counts 
(neutropenia) during the irfirst chemotherapy cycle?
