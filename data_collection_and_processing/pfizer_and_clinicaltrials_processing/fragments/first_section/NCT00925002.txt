Transthyretin amyloid polyneuropathy (ATTR-PN) is a rare and life-threatening medical condition which worsens over time. There are about 10,000 people in the world known to have ATTR-PN. People with this condition have a particular protein, known as transthyretin amyloid, in their nerves. This can lead to problems with the nervous system, such as weakness, numbness, or pain in the hands and feet (known as “neuropathy”) and difficulty walking. ATTR-PN is caused by a genetic mutation (change) in the transthyretin (TTR) gene. The most common genetic mutation that causes ATTR-PN is called “Val30Met”.
Tafamidis is a study drug approved in some countries to treat adult patients with ATTR-PN to delay neurological symptoms. The researchers in this study were interested in learning more about the long-term safety and effects of tafamidis.
This study had several purposes:
• To continue to study if tafamidis is safe and the potential effects of tafamidis in patients with ATTR-PN over the long-term.
• To continue to provide tafamidis to patients with ATTR-PN who had participated in previous clinical trials for tafamidis and were benefiting from taking it.
