What is Advanced Renal Cell Cancer?
Cancer occurs when cells in the body divide without control and can spread to other 
parts of the body.  Renal cell cancer is the most common form of kidney cancer.  It 
starts in the lining of the small tubes inside the kidney that help clean and filter blood.  
Advanced renal cell cancer is when the disease has progressed to Stage IV and has 
spread to other parts of the body.
What are Axitinib and MK -3475?
Axitinib , pronounced AK-sih-TIH-nib, also called Inlyta®, is a tablet, taken by mouth 
twice a day.  Researchers think Axitinib may help patients with advanced renal cell 
cancer by stopping the body from making a protein called “vascular endothelial 
growth factor”, or VEGF.  Cancer cells make extra amounts of some proteins 
including VEGF when growing.  The extra VEGF tells the surrounding cells to make 
new blood vessels that tumors need to grow.  Blood vessels are tiny tubes that allow 
blood to move around and provi de nutrients and oxygen to all the parts of the body.  
MK-3475, also called Pembrolizumab or Keytruda®, is an intravenous (IV) treatment 
that researchers believe may help patients with cancer.  MK -3475 works by sticking to 
a protein called “anti -programme d cell death protein”, which prevents it from 
protecting cancer cells from the body’s immune system. 
Researchers think taking both Axitinib and MK -3475 may help patients with 
advanced renal cell cancer, as they work in different ways.  However, first they needed 
to know more about the safety of taking both these treatments at the same time.  
What was the purpose of this study?
The purpose of this study was to and learn how safe the combination of Axitinib 
MK-3475 were for patients with advanced renal cell cancer and figure out the best 
dose to use in future studies.
