Ulcerative Colitis (or “UC”) is a long -term inflammatory medical condition that 
affects the large intestin es (also known as the colon).  The exact cause of UC is not 
known.  It is thought that UC is caused by an overactive immune system, which is 
normally responsible for fighting infections.  Medicines are available that lower the 
activity of the immune system , but some patients with UC do not get better when 
taking these medicines.  Some patients who do get better when taking these medicines 
still have their UC get worse over time.  Researchers are looking for new treatments 
that can help treat patients with U C.
PF-06480605 is an investigational medicine, and is a type of medicine that is called a 
“monoclonal antibody”.  Monoclonal antibodies are special proteins made by cells of 
the immune system that bind to and block the activity of other proteins.  
PF-06480 605 blocks the activity of an inflammatory protein called “TL1A”, which is 
thought to make UC worse.  By blocking this protein, researchers hope to lower 
inflammation in the large intestines and help patients with UC get better.
Researchers are studying PF -06480605 to see if it can safely treat moderate to severe 
UC.  To test the effectiveness of this medicine, the researchers asked:
Do patients treated with PF -06480605 have their UC improve after 14 weeks? 
To measure improvement, the researchers used a t est called the Mayo 
endoscopic subscore to measure how severe each patient’s UC was.
What medical problems do patients with UC have when they are treated 
with PF -06480605?
