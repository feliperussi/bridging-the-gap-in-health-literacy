This study wasdone to find out if an experimental vaccin emight prevent 
meningococcal B disease.  Meningococcal disease is an infection that causes the 
tissues that surround the brain and spinal cord to become swollen and inflamed.  It is 
caused by a germ called “meningococcus .”  
There are different types of t he meningococcal germ :types A, B, C, and Y.  The type 
B meningococcal germ causes more meningococcal disease than any other type of 
meningococcal germ.  While the likelihood of getting meningococcal B disease is very 
low, children under the age of 4 years are more likely to get it than any other age 
group.
Vaccines are given to prevent people from getting infections ,and they work by 
helping people to fight off germs.  While there are vaccines available to prevent other 
types of meningococcal disease, there isn’t one available worldwide to prevent 
meningococcal B disease .
The vaccine given in this study isan injectable called bivalen t rLP2086.   This study 
tested bivalent rLP2086 to see if it will help people fight off the meningococcal B 
germ and provi de protection (immunity) against the disease.  This could only be done
by testing the vaccine in healthy people who have never had an infection with 
meningococcal disease before.  
As this disease is most common in babies and toddlers, the vaccine was test edin this 
age group.  This study was done to seeif toddlers made immune system proteins, 
called antibodies ,after receiving bivalent rLP2086.  Antibodies help the body to fight 
off diseases, in this case, group B meningococcal disease.  Researchers also wanted to 
seewhat side effects toddlers have after receiving bivalent rLP2086 compared to a 
pediatric hepatitis A virus (HAV )vaccine. Bivalent rLP2086 is being compared to 
HAV because HAV is already widely used and the sideeffects of HAV are well 
known .
