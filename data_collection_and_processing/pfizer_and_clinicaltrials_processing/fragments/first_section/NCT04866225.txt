What is Non -Alcoholic Steatohepatitis with Liver Fibrosis?
Non-Alcoholic Steatohepatitis (NASH) with liver fibrosis is a medical condition 
where there is a high amount of fat in the liver along with inflammation (swelling) and 
fibrosis (scarring) that causes a stiff liver.
What is ervogastat ?
Ervog astat ( PF-06865571 )is a new investigational drug that is taken by mouth that 
has not yet been approved for use by health authorities . Ervogastat blocks a specific 
enzyme (protein) called “ DGAT2 ”and prevents the body from making certain types 
of fats. Too much fat in the liver is the first step toward development of NASH and 
liver scarring .Ervogastat decreases thestorage of fat in the liver , which may help 
treat NASH with liver scarring. 
What was the purpose of this study?
The purpose of this study wasto find out how much ervogastat wasin the 
participants’ blood, urine, and feces after theytook a “radio -labeled” form of 
ervogastat .  A radiolabel is a radioactive particle attached to a drug that lets scientists 
measure the amount of study drug in thebody.   Researchers also wanted to see how 
ervogastat is broken down or changed by the body.  This was done by measuring the 
amount of drug “metabolites ”of ervogastat.  Metabolites are the chemicals formed as 
adrug is broken down by the body .  
When ervogastat was injected orswallowed ,ervogastat entered the body and moved 
through the body. Ervogastat entered the blood and organs (for example, stomach, 
liver, and kidneys) when it moved through the body. Afterwards , ervogastat was 
removed from the body through urine and feces.   Researchers wanted to know:
How much radiolabeled ervogastat was found in theurine and 
feces of participants during the study ?
How waservogastat metaboli zed (changed or broken down )
by the participants’ bodies ?
