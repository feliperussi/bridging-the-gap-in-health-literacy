Atopic dermatitis (or “AD”), which is also sometimes called atopic eczema, is a
common skin disorder that causes patches of flaky, red, and very itchy skin. Some of 
the current medicines available for AD can only be used for short time periods, or can 
cause other health problems. Researchers are looking for new treatments for AD that 
can be taken for long periods of time.
While researchers think that many th ings cause AD, it is made worse by the body’s
immune system (the body’s defense against infection) causing redness and swelling
(inflammation). Cells in the immune system trigger inflammation by making special
proteins called “cytokines”. Researchers thi nk that medicines that modify the way 
these cytokines work could help treat patients with AD .  
The drug tested in this study was PF -04965842, which now has the generic name
abrocitinib. PF-04965842 is an experimental drug that has not been approved for 
sale. PF-04965842 blocks the activity of a protein called “Janus kinase 1”, which acts 
like an on/off switch for the cells of the immune system. By blocking Janus kinase 1 
activity , the signal to the cells that triggers inflammation is modified.
Patien ts with AD can have “flare -ups”, which are times when AD symptoms are 
worse.  The researchers in this study wanted to learn if patients who saw 
improvement in AD after beginning PF -04965842 would be able to maintain this 
improvement and have fewer flare -ups.  The researchers asked this question: 
How many patients who took PF-04965842 had a flare -up, compared to 
patients who took placebo?
