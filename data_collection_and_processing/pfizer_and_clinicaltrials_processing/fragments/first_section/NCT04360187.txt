What is atopic dermatitis ?
Atopic dermatitis is a common skin condition that can cause many symptoms, such as 
itching, redness, and a rash that is scaling or oozing.  The symptoms can look 
different on different people.  Atopic dermatitis is also known as eczema.   People 
with atopic dermatitis often have this condition for many years, and may have “flare 
ups”, when their symptoms worsen for a time.  
What is crisaborole ?
Crisaborole is a medicine that is used to treat atopic dermatitis.  It is applied to the 
skin as an ointment twice a day.  Crisaborole may improve symptoms of atopic 
dermatitis by decreasing inflammation in the skin.  Inflammation is the body’s 
immune system response, which can lead to symptoms such as redness .
What was the purpose of this study?
The purpose of the study was to see if the symptoms of mild to moderate atopic 
dermatitis were reduced when crisaborole ointment was applied twice a day to the 
affected area compared to when a vehicle ointment was used.  The vehicle ointment 
does not have a ny medicine in it, but it looks and feels just like the crisaborole 
ointment.  
Crisaborole is a licensed treatment for atopic dermatitis in adults and children in some 
countries (United States, Canada, China, Israel, and Australia) .  This study was 
conducted in China and Japan to allow data to be collected in these countries .

Researchers wanted to know:
Did the symptoms of atopic dermatitis in adults and children 
2years and older reduce in areas of skin treated with crisaborole, 
and did the condition get better compared to areas of skin treated 
with vehicle ointment?
