Alopecia areata (AA) is an autoimmune skin disease that causes hair loss ranging from 
small patches to a loss of all hair on the head and body.  AA occurs when the immune 
system mistakes normal cells in the body as foreign invaders and attacks these cells.  
There is no cure for AA and most countries do not have an approved treatment for 
AA.  Treatments that reduce the ac tivity of parts of the immune system are often used 
to treat AA, but some of these treatments can cause other health problems or can 
only be used for short periods of time.  Researchers are looking for new treatments 
for AA that can be taken safely for lon gerperiods of time.
Two (2)drugs were tested in this study: PF -06651600 and PF -06700841.  
PF-06651600 and PF -06700841 are both experimental drugs that have not been 
approved for sale yet.  PF -06651600 blocks the activity of protein scalled “Janus 
kinase 3” and the “TEC family kinase s”.PF-06700841 blocks the activity of 2other 
enzymes called “Janus kinase 1” and “Tyrosine -protein kinase 2”.  These enzymes act 
like on/off switches for the cells of the immune system.  By turning off these 
switches, the ce lls of the immune system are expected to produce fewer cytokines, a 
different type of protein, that are believed to make AA worse.  
The researchers wanted to know,
Were patients who took PF-06651600 or PF -06700841 more likely to have 
their AA improve compared to patients who were treated with a placebo?
To do this, researchers measured the severity of each patient’s AA at the beginning of 
the study.  The researchers measured the severity o f AA after 24 weeks of treatment.  
The difference in severity was used to decide if a patient’s AA had improved or not.
