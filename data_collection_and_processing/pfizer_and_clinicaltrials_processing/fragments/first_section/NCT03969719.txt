What is non -alcoholic fatty liver disease with type 2 diabetes 
mellitus? 
Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a condition where too much fa t is 
stored in the liver and where those affected drink little to no alcohol.  NAFLD may 
worsen into a condition called non -alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH).  NASH 
develops when excess fat contributes to increased inflammation and liver cell death.  
NASH i s associated with increased risk of death, scarring and failure of the liver, and 
liver cancers.  
Conditions that increase the risk of NAFLD and NASH to develop include being 
overweight, type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), high blood pressure, and high level s of 
cholesterol and fats in the blood.  Participants with T2DM are of special interest and 
included in this study.
What is PF -06835919?
PF-06835919 was the drug investigated in this study in participants who have T2DM 
and may have NAFLD.  PF -06835919 reduces the activity of an enzyme called 
ketohexokinase (KHK).  KHK speeds up the change of fruit sugar (fructose) to 
energy used by the body and increases fat production in the liver.  Fructose increases 
the risk of too much fat in the liver.  PF -06835919 was used as a treatment to lower 
the activity of KHK, reduce liver fat, reduce HbA1c, and prevent the development of 
NASH.  PF -06835919 is a n investigational drug because it is not approved for use in 
this country. 
What were the purposes of this study?
The primary purposes of the study were to compare the effects of PF -06835919 at 
2doses (150 mg and 300 mg) compared with a placebo to find out if PF -06835919 
helps reduce liver fat and hemoglobin A1C (HbA1c).  The amount of HbA1c in the 
blood shows the av erage amount of glucose (a type of sugar) over the past 3 months.  This study looked at the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of 2 doses of PF -06835919 
over a 16 -week period.  Specifically, researchers wanted to know if PF -06835919 
reduced liver fat and H bA1c at 16 weeks compared to placebo (efficacy).  Safety 
means that any medical problems that happened were studied.  Tolerability means 
whether a medical problem interfered with a participantâ€™s usual activities.
