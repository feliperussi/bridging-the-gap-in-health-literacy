Rheumatoid arthritis, or “RA”, is a disease that causes swelling, pain, and stiffness in 
the joints.  RA is an “autoimmune disease”, which means that patients with RA have 
an overactive immune system that mistakenly attacks healthy parts of the body, such 
as the joints.  RA can cause permanent damage to the j oints if it goes un treated , so 
researchers are looking for new treatment options for RA.   
Patients in this study were treated with PF -06650833, which is an “investigational 
drug” .  This means it is not approved for use in people with RA  and is a new type of 
drug that is being studied for the treatment of RA .  Some of the patients in this study 
were also treated with tofacitinib.  This is a medicine that works to reduce the activity 
of the immune system in people with RA.  It is an oral  (taken by mouth) med ication 
that has been approved, and is available by prescription, to treat adults with active, 
moderate to severe RA that did not respond well to medications known as disease-
modifying anti -rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) like methotrexate.  
Researchers did this study to see if taking PF -06650833 helped with the symptoms of 
RA by reducing inflammation.
