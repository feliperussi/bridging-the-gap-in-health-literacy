An intraabdominal infection , or “ IAI”, is the name for a type of infection in the 
abdomen (stomach area).  Children with a nIAI may have symptoms such as stomach 
area pain orfever .  Some IAIsare serious ,and can require someone to be in the 
hospital to be treated with intravenous (IV) antibiotics and sometimes surgery .  This 
type of serious IAI is known as a “complicated IAI”.
Ceftazidime -avibactam (CAZ -AVI) is anantib iotic medicine which is used to treat a 
number of infections caused by certain types of bacteria .  CAZ -AVI is currently used 
to treat serious infections , such as complicated IAI, in adults . This study was 
designed to learn more about using CAZ -AVI to treat complicated IAI in children, 
when used together with another antibiotic medic inecalled metronidazole .  CAZ -AVI
has not been approved for use in children , as it is still being studied.   The ceftazidime 
half of CAZ -AVI has previously been approved for use in children.
Themain purpose of this study was to learn more about the useof CAZ -AVI in 
children with c omplicated IAI, when given together with metronid azole,compared to 
another antibiotic medic inecalled meropenem .The researchers wanted to answer 
this main question:
For children treated with CAZ -AVI, how well was it tolerated, and were there 
any new medical problems different from those can happen when using 
ceftazadime alone?
In addition, the researchers also wanted to see how many children in this study were 
cured or had an improvement in complicat ed IAI.
