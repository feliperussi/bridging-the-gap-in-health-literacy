What is rheumatoid arthritis?
Rheumatoid arthritis, or “RA”, is a disease that causes swelling, pain, and stiffness in 
the joints.  RA is an “a utoimmune disease”, which means that patients with RA have 
an overactive immune system that mistakenly attacks healthy parts of the body, such 
as the joints.  RA can cause permanent damage to the joints if it goes unchecked .
What is tofacitinib?
Tofacitinib is a medicine that works to reduce the activity of the immune system.  It is 
an oral (taken by mouth) prescription medicine that is used treat adults with active, 
moderate to severe RA that did not respond well to medicines known as 
disease -modifying anti -rheumatic drugs (DMARDs), like methotrexate (“MTX”).  
Tofacitinib may help calm the activity of the immune system and decrease RA signs 
and symptoms. 
What was the purpose of this study?
Researchers did this study to learn more about the safety of 2 different doses of 
tofacitinib, compared to a tumor necrosis factor inhibitor (TNF inhibitor).  TNF 
inhibitors are another type of medicine that work to reduce the activity of the immune 
system.
