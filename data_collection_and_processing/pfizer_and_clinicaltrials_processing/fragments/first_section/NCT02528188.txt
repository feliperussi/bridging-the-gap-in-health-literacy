Osteoarthritis is a common joint condition that affects millions of people a round the 
world.  Osteoarthritis happens when the “carti lage” in the joint wears down through 
overuse , injury or patient age.  Cartilage is the  rubbery material that acts as padding , or 
a cushion , between t he bones in the joint and  stops the  bones  from rubbing together .  
When the cartilage wear s down , the joint  can become stiff and painful .  Osteoarthritis 
often affects the knees and hips but can be seen in other joints.   
Researchers did this study to compare the long -term pain relief and “joint safety”  of 
non-steroidal anti -inflammatory drugs ( also known as NSAIDs) with tanezumab in 
patients with osteoarthritis of the hips or knees.  Joint safety is a measure of how well 
the bone and joint are doing and whether there are any safety problems.  D octors 
often prescribe NSAIDs like naproxen, celecoxib, or diclofenac to help patients with 
their osteoarthritis .  Tanezumab is an “investigational drug”, which means it is not 
approved for use in the countries where the patients in this study live.  It is a new type  
of drug that is being studied to see if it may be able to help patients with osteoarthritis 
pain.
