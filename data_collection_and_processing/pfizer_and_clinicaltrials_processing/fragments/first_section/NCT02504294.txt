Anemia is a condition when a person has a low amount o f red blood cells in their 
body .Anemia is common in patients with chronic kidney disease because their 
bodies may not make enough erythropoietin , a horm one that is needed to make red 
blood cells. Patients who have anemia can feel weak or very tired, have trouble 
breathing, or have headaches.
There are a variety of ways to treat anemia.  One (1) medicine that is used is called 
Epogen® (epoetin alfa).  Epogen may help the body make red blood cells.
Retacrit® ( epoetin alfa-epbx )is a new medicine for a nemia.  Retacrit was made to be 
similar to Epogen.  The reason for making a drug that is similar to Epogen is to help 
give patients access to a comparable but less expensive medicine.  At the time of this 
study, Retacrit was still being tested and was not yet approved for use.  Retacrit is now 
approved for use in Europe and the United States. 
The purpose of this st udy was to learn more about switching from Epogen to Retacrit
forpatients with anemia and chronic kidney disease.  
Patients who take medicines like Epogen or Retacrit must have blood tests regularly.  
These tests measure the amount of a protein in the blood called “hemoglobin”, which
tellsdoctors how well the medicine is working. Hemoglobin contains iron and helps 
tocarry oxygen from the lungs to the body.
Usually, doctors look for a hemoglobin “target range” of 9 to 11 g/dL.  Patients with 
hemoglobin levels below this range often have anemia symptoms.  
For this study, r esearchers wanted to know:
Over the last 8 wee ks of the study, what proportion of time were hemoglobin 
levels in the target range, for patients who took Retacrit compared to those who 
took Epogen ?
