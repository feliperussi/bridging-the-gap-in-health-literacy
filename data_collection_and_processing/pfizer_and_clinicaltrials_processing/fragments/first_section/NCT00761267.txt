Candida is a type of fungus that is normally found in small amounts in the human body. Sometimes, too much Candida can grow in the body and cause health problems. This is known as a Candida infection.
The name “invasive Candida infection” is used when the infection has spread to other parts of the body through the bloodstream. Certain medicines or diseases, like cancer, may make a child more likely to develop an invasive Candida infection.
Anidulafungin is a medicine that is currently used to treat Candida infections in adults. This study was designed to learn more about using anidulafungin to treat Candida infections in children. Anidulafungin has not been approved for use in children, as it is still being studied.
The main purpose of this study was to learn more about the safety of anidulafungin in children with invasive Candida infection. The researchers wanted to answer this question:
• Did the children in this study have any new or worsening medical problems? If so, what new or worsening medical problems did the children have?
The researchers also wanted to learn more about how anidulafungin works to treat invasive Candida infection in children. The researchers wanted to answer this question:
• How many children were cured or had an improvement in Candida infection?
