Growth hormone is a substance that is needed for normal growth.  It is made by a 
small gland in the brain called the “pituitary gland”.  Some children have a condition 
called “growth hormone defici ency”, which means that their pituitary gland is not 
making enough growth hormone.  Children who are not treated for this condition 
may not grow and be as tall as other children of the same age .
Doctors may prescribe a medicine called Genotropin®(somatrop in) that helps 
children with growth hormone deficiency to grow.  Genotropin is known as a 
“recombinant human growth hormone”, which means that it is identical to the natural 
human growth hormone, but is made by scientists to be used as a medicine.  This 
treatment involves injections with a small needle under the skin, given each day .
Researchers have developed a recombinant human growth hormone called 
somatrogon.  It is given once per week instead of each day.  The purpose of this study 
was to learn more about the use of somatrogon in children with growth hormone 
deficiency.  Researchers wanted to know:
How much did a weekly treatment schedule with somatrogon interfere with the 
patient’s life, compared to a daily treatment schedule with Genotropin?
The stu dy also looked at the overall safety of somatrogon in children with growth 
hormone deficiency.
