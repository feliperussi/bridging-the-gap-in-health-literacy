Heart disease is a leading cause of death in both men and women.  One of the 
biggest risks for gettin g heart disease is having high “ bad” cholesterol (called 
LDL, or low-density lipoprotein cholesterol).  Having high LDL cholesterol can 
lead to heart problems. 
Doctors prescribe me dicines called “statins”  to patients with high LDL 
cholesterol to  lower the LDL cholesterol in the blood.  Some people have 
muscle-related medical problems when taking statins.  These medical problems 
include muscle spasms and pain in the muscles (myalgia), which may be severe .  
This may prevent them from being able to take their prescribed statin 
medications. 
Researchers did this study to look for a new way to treat patients with high 
LDL cholesterol who are unable to take a statin because of musc le-related 
medical problems.  Bococizumab was the medicine tested in this study.  It is not 
a statin.  Bococizumab is a medicine that was given in this study as an injection 
under the skin (subcutaneous) which may help to lower LDL cholesterol.  For 
this study, researchers wanted to answer the question:   Does bococizumab help 
to lower LDL cholesterol in patients who cannot take statin medications?
