What is advanced cancer?
This study looked at participants with different types of advanced cancer, including 
metastatic pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma ( mPDAC). Pancreatic ductal 
adenocarcinoma is the most common type of pancreatic cancer. The pancreas is an 
organ located near the stomach that plays a role in the breakdown of food and helps 
to regulate blood sugar levels. Cancer occurs when cells in the body div ide without 
control , sometimes these cells form masses called “tumours”. Cancer is called 
“metastatic” when it spread sto other parts of the body. Metastatic c ancer is extremely 
difficult to be cured or controlled with treatment.
What are avelumab, binime tinib, and talazoparib?
Avelumab, binimetinib, and talazoparib are all medications made to help patients fight 
cancer in different ways.  All three medications have been approved in the U nited 
States and Europe for treating different types of cancer.  Avel umab is an intravenous 
(IV) cancer treatment, received at a clinic.  Binimetinib and talazoparib are both taken 
by mouth.  Researchers think that using combinations of these medications may help 
stop cancers from growing.
What was the purpose of this study?
The purpose of this study was to learn if combinations of avelumab, binimetinib, and 
talazoparib were safe for study participant s with advanced cancer.  All three drugs 
together had never been given before as a combination treatment.  If the medicat ions 
were safe, the researchers would then ask if participants with advanced cancer taking 
only 2 of the study medications or participants taking all 3 study medications saw their 
cancer get better.

Researchers wanted to know:
Was there a combination of doses of avelumab and
binimetinib or binimetinib and talazoparib that could be 
given safely for more studies in the future?
