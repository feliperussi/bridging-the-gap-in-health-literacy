C difficile  is a type of bacteria that can cause serious infections.  It often shows up as 
antibiotic-associated diarrhea and is the most commonly recognized cause of 
infectious diarrhea in healthcare settings.  The number of C difficile  cases has increased 
recently, including in hospitals and nursing homes, possibly because of stronger 
strains of C difficile  bacteria and increased use of antibiotics. 
There is no approved vaccine to prevent primary C difficile  infection.  The 
investigational vaccine used in this study , PF-06425090, is an injection that helps the 
body produce an immune system response and potentially defend against a C difficile 
infection. 
 The purpose of th is trial was to find a safe dose of the PF-06425090 vaccine 
that caused few or no negative medical problems.  This is why 2 different dose 
amounts were studied.  Some volunteers received 3 injections of 100 µg 
(100 micrograms).  Others received 3 injections of 200 µg.  A third group 
received 3 injections of a solution with no active medication in it (placebo).   
o The placebo group was used to compare against the effects seen in 
volunteers who received the 2 different dose amounts of PF-06425090 
vaccine (100 µg and 200 µg). 
o  A previous study has already shown that the PF-06425090 vaccine can 
produce an immune system response against C difficile in humans. 
  This study was divided into 3 stages: 
o The first 2 stages tested the 2 dose amounts of PF-06425090 vaccine 
(100 µg and 200 µg) and placebo in volunteers who were between 50 and 
64 years of age (Stage 1) and 65 to 85 years of age (Stage 2).    
o Based on the findings in Stage 2, a third stage was planned to compare 
3 injections of the most effective (best immune response) and well 
tolerated dose of PF-06425090 vaccine (either 100 µg or 200 µg) with 
placebo in volunteers who were 65 to 85 years of age.
