Prostate cancer is common in men and happens when the cells of the “prostate ” start 
to grow out of control.  The prostate is a gland that is part of the male reproductive 
system.  Patients with prostate cancer are often treated with hormone therapy and/ or 
“orchiectomy”.  Orchiectomy is the surgical removal of  1 or both testicles (sometimes 
called  castration ).  Even with  hormone therapy and/or surgery , the cancer can come 
back.  If this happens , it is called castration -resistant prostate cancer  and hormone 
therapy, immunotherapy, radiotherapy, or chemotherapy  may be given .  Prostate 
cancer may also “metastasize” or spread to other areas of the body.  Often new 
cancers will develop in the bone  and these cancers are described as metastatic bone 
tumors.   
One type of hormone therapy that can be given to patients wi th castration -resistant 
prostate cancer  is Xtandi® (enzalutamide) .  This medicine  can be used to treat  
metastatic a s well as non- metastatic disease in many countries around the world , 
including the United States, Canada and Eur ope.   
This study used 18F-sodium fluoride positron -emission tomography/computed 
tomography (18F-NaF PET -CT) to look at the effect of enzalutamid e treatment  on 
metastatic bone tumors in patients with castration -resistant prostate cancer.   18F-NaF 
PET-CT is an imaging test that can b e used to see what is happening to a tumor and 
if the tumor  is responding  to treatment.  Patients in this study were treated with 
enzalutamide  and the researchers look ed to see if the tumor wa s shrinking , staying the 
same, or getting bigger  after treatment .  If the tumor gets bigger , different treatment 
options may be needed .
