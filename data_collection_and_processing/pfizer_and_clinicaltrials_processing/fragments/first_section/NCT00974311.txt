Prostate cancer is the name for cancer that starts in the prostate, which is a small, walnut-sized gland that lies at the base of the bladder in men and is part of the male reproductive system.

Enzalutamide is a prescription medicine that is approved to treat men with prostate cancer that no longer responds to a medical or surgical treatment that lowers testosterone. Enzalutamide works by interfering with the connections between androgens (a type of hormone that plays a role in male traits and reproductivity) and androgen receptors (a protein in the body that attaches to androgens). This may help to slow the growth of prostate cancer.

The main goal of this study was to learn more about the use of enzalutamide in patients with prostate cancer that was spreading to other parts of the body, despite receiving chemotherapy and treatment to block androgens. Chemotherapy is a type of medicine used to destroy cancer cells. Researchers wanted to answer this research question:
â€¢ How long did patients survive after receiving enzalutamide, compared to placebo?
