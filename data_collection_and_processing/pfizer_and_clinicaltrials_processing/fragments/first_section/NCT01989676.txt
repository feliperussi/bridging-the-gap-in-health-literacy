Some women with breast cancer have high levels of a certain protein receptor on the 
surface on their cancer cells.  This protein is called HER2 (human epidermal growth 
factor receptor 2).  A cell with too many HER2 rece ptors is stimulat ed to grow and 
multiply too fast and can become a cancer tumor .  When women with breast cancer 
have too much of this protein their cancer is called “HER2 -positive”.
Trastuzumab (Herceptin®)is an approved drug for the treatment of patients with 
HER2 -positive breast cancer.  PF -05280014 was the investigational drug in this study.  
An investigational drug is one that is not approved for sale.
Researchers think that PF-05280014 may work like Her ceptin in the body.  Herceptin
isan antibod y, which is a type of protein.  Herceptin bindsto the HER2 receptor on 
the surface of cells .  By attaching to the HER2 receptor, this medicine can block the 
signals that cause the cells to grow and multiply.  
Patients who were in this study received either PF -05280014 or Herceptin in 
combination with paclitaxel .  Paclitaxel is a standard chemotherapy treatment for 
breast cancer.  It was used in this study because it iscommonly given to patients by 
doctors for t he treatment of breast cancer.  
The main purpose of this study was to find out if PF -05280014 worked similarly to 
Herceptin in patients with breast cancer.  Researchers wanted to answer this question:
What percentage of patients who received PF-05280014 and paclitaxel had a 
reduction in tumor size, compared to pa tients who received Herceptin and 
paclitaxel ?
