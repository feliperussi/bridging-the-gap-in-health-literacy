People with transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy have higher than normal levels of a particular protein in their heart. This increases the risk of having heart problems, like heart failure.
Tafamidis is a study drug that is being tested for the treatment of transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy. Tafamidis is currently approved to treat transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy in Japan and the United States. Tafamidis is not approved to treat transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy in other countries because it is still being tested.
This study had 2 purposes:
To understand the safety of tafamidis: to see what medical problems patients had during the study
To look at controlling transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy: to see if patients taking tafamidis were less likely to have a stay in the hospital and less likely to die earlier because of transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy.
