What is Non-Alcoholic Steatohepatitis with Liver Fibrosis?
Non-Alcoholic Steatohepatitis (NASH) with liver fibrosis is a medical condition where there is a high amount of fat in the liver along with inflammation (swelling) and fibrosis (scarring) that causes a stiff liver.
What is ervogastat?
Ervogastat (PF-06865571) is a new investigational drug that is taken by mouth that has not yet been approved for use by health authorities. Ervogastat blocks a specific enzyme (protein) called "DGAT2" and prevents the body from making certain types of fats. Too much fat in the liver is the first step toward development of NASH and liver scarring. Ervogastat decreases the storage of fat in the liver, which may help treat NASH with liver scarring.
What was the purpose of this study?
The purpose of this study was to find out how much ervogastat was in the participants' blood, urine, and feces after they took a "radio-labeled" form of ervogastat. A radiolabel is a radioactive particle attached to a drug that lets scientists measure the amount of study drug in the body. Researchers also wanted to see how ervogastat is broken down or changed by the body. This was done by measuring the amount of drug "metabolites" of ervogastat. Metabolites are the chemicals formed as a drug is broken down by the body.
When ervogastat was injected or swallowed, ervogastat entered the body and moved through the body. Ervogastat entered the blood and organs (for example, stomach, liver, and kidneys) when it moved through the body. Afterwards, ervogastat was removed from the body through urine and feces. Researchers wanted to know:
- How much radiolabeled ervogastat was found in the urine and feces of participants during the study?
- How was ervogastat metabolized (changed or broken down) by the participants' bodies?
