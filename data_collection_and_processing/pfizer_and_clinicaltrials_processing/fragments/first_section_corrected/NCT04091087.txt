What is stasis dermatitis?
Stasis dermatitis is a skin condition that occurs on the lower legs because of slow or 
stopped blood flow. Its symptoms include redness, itch, pain, reduced comfort, 
swelling and not being able to perform daily activities. Stasis dermatitis mostly affects 
older people. Around 15 to 20 million people older than 50 years have stasis 
dermatitis in the United States.
What is crisaborole?
Crisaborole is an oil-based preparation (also referred to as 'ointment') which is applied 
onto the skin. Researchers think that crisaborole may help treat stasis dermatitis by 
decreasing inflammation in the skin. Inflammation is a type of defense mechanism 
the body has, which can lead to symptoms like redness and swelling.
Crisaborole ointment is approved in the US (EUCRISAâ„¢) and is available by 
prescription for treating mild to moderate atopic dermatitis (also known as atopic 
eczema which is a condition that causes the skin to become itchy, dry, and cracked). 
However, it is an investigational drug in this study because it is not approved for the 
treatment of stasis dermatitis.
What was the purpose of this study?
The purpose of this study was to compare the effects of crisaborole ointment and 
vehicle ointment to treat the symptoms of stasis dermatitis. The vehicle ointment is 
just like the crisaborole ointment, but it does not contain the active ingredient, 
crisaborole. Researchers wanted to know:
Did the symptoms of stasis dermatitis decrease in participants 
treated with crisaborole ointment compared to participants treated 
with vehicle ointment?
