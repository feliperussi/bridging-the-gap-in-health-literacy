Osteoarthritis is a common disease of the joints that can happen when the cartilage, a protective tissue that covers the joints, begins to wear down over time. This can cause symptoms such as pain, tenderness, stiffness, and loss of flexibility in the affected joints. It can also cause "bone spurs", or extra pieces of bone, to form around the joints.
There is currently no cure for osteoarthritis, but doctors can prescribe medicines to manage pain and other symptoms. These medicines may not work well for all patients with osteoarthritis, so researchers are looking for additional treatment options. Tanezumab is being studied as a possible treatment option for osteoarthritis. Because it is still being tested, tanezumab has not been approved for use in patients.
The main purpose of this study was to learn more about how tanezumab works to treat osteoarthritis symptoms. The researchers wanted to answer this question:
- Did patients who received tanezumab have an improvement in osteoarthritis symptoms, compared to patients who received placebo?
A placebo does not have any medicine in it, but looks just like the medicine. A placebo is also known as a "dummy drug".
