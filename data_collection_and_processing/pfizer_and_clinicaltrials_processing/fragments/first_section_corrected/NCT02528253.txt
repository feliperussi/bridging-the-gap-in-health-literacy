Chronic low back pain is pain in the lower back that lasts for 3 months or more. 
Doctors can prescribe medicines to manage this pain, but these medicines may not 
work well for all patients, so researchers are looking for additional treatment options. 
Tanezumab was evaluated in patients with chronic low back pain. Tanezumab is not 
approved for use in patients.
The main purpose of this study was to learn more about how tanezumab works to 
treat chronic low back pain symptoms. The researchers wanted to answer this 
question:
- Did patients who received tanezumab have an improvement in chronic low 
back pain symptoms, compared to patients who received placebo?
A placebo does not have any medicine in it, but looks just like the medicine.
