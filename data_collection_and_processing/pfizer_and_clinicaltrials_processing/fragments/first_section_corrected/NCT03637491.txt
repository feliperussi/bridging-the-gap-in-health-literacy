What is advanced cancer?
This study looked at participants with different types of advanced cancer, including metastatic pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (mPDAC). Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma is the most common type of pancreatic cancer. The pancreas is an organ located near the stomach that plays a role in the breakdown of food and helps to regulate blood sugar levels. Cancer occurs when cells in the body divide without control, sometimes these cells form masses called "tumours". Cancer is called "metastatic" when it spreads to other parts of the body. Metastatic cancer is extremely difficult to be cured or controlled with treatment.
What are avelumab, binimetinib, and talazoparib?
Avelumab, binimetinib, and talazoparib are all medications made to help patients fight cancer in different ways. All three medications have been approved in the United States and Europe for treating different types of cancer. Avelumab is an intravenous (IV) cancer treatment, received at a clinic. Binimetinib and talazoparib are both taken by mouth. Researchers think that using combinations of these medications may help stop cancers from growing.
What was the purpose of this study?
The purpose of this study was to learn if combinations of avelumab, binimetinib, and talazoparib were safe for study participants with advanced cancer. All three drugs together had never been given before as a combination treatment. If the medications were safe, the researchers would then ask if participants with advanced cancer taking only 2 of the study medications or participants taking all 3 study medications saw their cancer get better.

Researchers wanted to know:
- Was there a combination of doses of avelumab and binimetinib or binimetinib and talazoparib that could be given safely for more studies in the future?
