Lung cancer is the name for cancer that starts in the lungs. Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the most common type of lung cancer. Avastin® is one medicine that is currently used to treat NSCLC. Avastin may stop cancer tumors from growing. PF-06439535 is a medicine that is made to be similar to Avastin, and is being studied as a possible treatment for many cancers. In this specific study, Avastin was studied for NSCLC. The purpose of making a medicine similar to Avastin is to give patients another treatment option. A committee of doctors have reviewed the data and recommended that PF-06439535 be approved for use in Europe. PF-06439535 is still being tested and has not been approved for use in other regions.
The main goal of this study was to determine if PF-06439535 works in a similar way to Avastin. Patients in this study also received 2 other medicines for NSCLC, called paclitaxel and carboplatin. Researchers wanted to know:
At week 19 of the study, how many patients who took PF-06439535 would have a reduction in tumor size (tumor getting smaller), compared to patients who took Avastin?
