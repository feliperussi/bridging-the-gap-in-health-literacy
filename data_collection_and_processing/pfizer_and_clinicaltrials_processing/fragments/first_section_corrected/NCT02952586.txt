Squamous cell carcinoma is a type of cancer that originates in the squamous cells, which are flat cells that line the outer layer of the skin and the mouth, nose, and throat. Squamous cell carcinoma is the most common type of cancer found in the head and neck.
Researchers are looking for treatments for squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck. Avelumab is a medicine that may work by targeting a protein called "Programmed Death-Ligand 1" (PD-L1) found on the cancer cell. PD-L1 is involved in the body's immune system response to cancer.
When this study was started, avelumab was being tested for use in patients with locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck. Locally advanced refers to cancer that has spread to nearby body tissues. Although avelumab is approved in other types of cancer, it is not approved for use in head and neck cancer.
The standard treatment for squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck includes a combination of radiation therapy and a chemotherapy medicine called cisplatin. The main goal of this study was to determine if adding a new drug (avelumab) before, during, and after standard treatment would increase the amount of time it takes for cancer to worsen (progress). The study also evaluated the overall safety of avelumab in combination with standard radiation and chemotherapy treatment.
