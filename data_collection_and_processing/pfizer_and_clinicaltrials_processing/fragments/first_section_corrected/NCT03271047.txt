What is colorectal cancer?
Colorectal cancer is cancer that starts in the large intestine (colon) or the rectum (last part of the large intestine). Participants in this study had metastatic colorectal cancer, which means that the cancer had spread outside of the colon or rectum. Additionally, the participants in this study had tumors that were considered to be "microsatellite stable" (MSS), and which contained a specific mutated gene called RAS that can cause cancer cells to grow and to spread.
What are binimetinib, nivolumab, and ipilimumab?
There were 3 treatments tested in this study: binimetinib, nivolumab, and ipilimumab. Binimetinib is a treatment that may block the growth and spread of cancer. Binimetinib is taken as a tablet by mouth. In this study, binimetinib was an investigational treatment, which means that it is still being tested and has not been approved for use in patients with colorectal cancer. Nivolumab and ipilimumab are 2 types of antibody treatments that may help the immune system to fight cancer. Nivolumab and ipilimumab are given through a needle into the vein (IV). In this study, nivolumab and ipilimumab were investigational treatments.
What was the purpose of this study?
The main purposes of this study were to learn more about the safety of binimetinib, nivolumab, and ipilimumab and to determine the recommended dose for further testing, and to learn whether binimetinib, nivolumab, and ipilimumab had positive effects for patients with metastatic colorectal cancer with RAS mutations and that are MSS. Researchers wanted to know:
Part 1: did participants have dose-limiting toxicities?
Part 2: did participants have a reduction in tumor size?
“Dose-limiting toxicities” (DLTs) are certain medical problems caused by taking study treatment which require the participant to lower the dose or stop taking the treatment (permanently or temporarily). Researchers collect information on DLTs to help determine the recommended dose of a study treatment.
