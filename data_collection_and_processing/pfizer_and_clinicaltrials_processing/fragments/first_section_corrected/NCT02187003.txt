```Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a common "inherited" blood disorder. Inherited means it is passed down from parents to their children and so runs in families. In the United States, approximately 100,000 people have SCD while around the world it is estimated that at least 5 million people have SCD. A further 100 million people worldwide are thought to carry the SCD trait. This means they may pass SCD to their children, although they do not have any symptoms of SCD themselves. While most people with SCD in the United States are African-American or African, the disease can affect many different ethnic groups including people from the Middle East, India, and the Southern Mediterranean. 
Many people with SCD will develop a condition known as an "acute pain crisis" or "vaso-occlusive crisis" (VOC). This happens when cells in the blood of a person with SCD block blood vessels ("vascular occlusion"). This limits blood flow and oxygen delivery to areas of the body ("tissue ischemia"), which causes pain. 
Rivipansel is a new type of treatment that was expected to be able to interrupt or lessen the events in the blood vessels that lead to a VOC. The researchers in this study wanted to see if rivipansel treatment could shorten the time that patients had to stay in the hospital for treatment of a VOC.```
