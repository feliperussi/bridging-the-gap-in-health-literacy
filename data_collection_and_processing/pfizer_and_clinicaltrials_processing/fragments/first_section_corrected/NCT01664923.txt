Prostate cancer is the name for cancer that starts in the prostate, which is a small, walnut-sized gland that lies at the base of the bladder in men and is part of the male reproductive system.
Prostate cancer is a common cancer in men, and it is often a slow-growing cancer with few symptoms.
Enzalutamide is a prescription medicine that is approved to treat men with prostate cancer. Enzalutamide works by interfering with the connections between androgens (a type of hormone that plays a role in male traits and reproductive) and androgen receptors (a protein in the body that attaches to androgens). This may help to slow the growth of prostate cancer.
The main goal of this study was to learn more about the use of enzalutamide in patients with prostate cancer that did not sufficiently improve after receiving treatment to block androgens. Researchers wanted to answer this research question:
- How long did patients survive without prostate cancer getting worse after receiving enzalutamide, compared to bicalutamide?
Bicalutamide is a medicine approved to treat men with prostate cancer.
