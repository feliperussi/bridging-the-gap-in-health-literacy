What is hepatic impairment?
Hepatic impairment means that a person's liver is not functioning normally. The liver plays an important role in keeping the body healthy, including helping to digest food and helping to remove substances such as medicines or their byproducts from the body. People with hepatic impairment may not be able to remove some substances from the body as well as people with normal liver function.
What is PF-06835919?
PF-06835919 is an investigational drug being studied for the possible treatment of a type of liver disease. An investigational drug is one that has not been approved for use outside of research studies. PF-06835919 is a pill that is taken daily by mouth.
What was the purpose of this study?
The purpose of this study was to compare how PF-06835919 moved through the body and how long it stayed in the body in participants with varying levels of hepatic impairment and in participants with normal liver function. After PF-06835919 was swallowed, it entered the body (through the stomach and intestine) and moved through the body. PF-06835919 entered the blood and organs (for example, liver) when it moved through the body. Afterwards, PF-06835919 was removed from the body through urine and feces.
This study did not test if PF-06835919 helps to treat liver disease.
Researchers wanted to know:
- How did PF-06835919 act in the body of participants with varying levels of hepatic impairment, compared to participants with normal liver function?
- What medical problems did participants have during the study?
