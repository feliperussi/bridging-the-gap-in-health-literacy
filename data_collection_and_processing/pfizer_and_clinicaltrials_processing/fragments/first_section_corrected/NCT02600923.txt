Breast cancer is one of the most common types of cancer in women and there were over 2 million new cases worldwide in 2018. Lots of different types of breast cancer exist, so a range of treatment options are needed. One treatment option for a specific type of advanced or "metastatic" breast cancer is IBRANCEÂ® (palbociclib). Metastatic means that the cancer has spread to other areas of the body. IBRANCE (palbociclib) treatment was first approved for use in 2015. The researchers did this study so that they could offer patients with specific types of advanced breast cancer treatment with palbociclib if this treatment was not commercially approved or if patients were not eligible for clinical trials. This study ended when palbociclib became commercially available in participating countries and doctors were able to prescribe this treatment for their patients.
