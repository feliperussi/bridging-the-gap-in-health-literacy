This study compared patients who received tafamidis with patients who received
placebo ,to understand if tafam idishelped patients with transthyretin amyloid 
cardiomyopathy . A placebo does not have any medicine in it, but looks just like the 
medicine being studied .
This was a randomized trial ,meaning patients were put randomly (by chance) into 
1of 3 groups: 
Group 1: received a study drug called tafamidis at a dose of 20 milligrams ( mg)
Group 2: received a study drug called tafamidis at a dose of 80 mg
Group 3: received a placebo that didn’t contain any drug 
Putting patients into groups randomly makes comparing the groups more fair.

3The study included patients who had a history of heart failure due to transthyretin 
amyloid cardiomyopathy .  The patient s and researchers did not know who took 
tafamidis and who took the placebo.  This is known as a “blinded” study.  This means 
that neither the patients nor doctors knew which drug the patients actually got.
The study began 09 December 2013 and ended 07 Febr uary 2018 . While patients 
were in the study for 2.5 years (30 months) , the entire study took about 4.5 years to 
complete.  At the end of this study, all patients were offered the possibility to 
continue tafamidis treatment in a separate study to help rese archers collect more data 
on the safety of tafamidis .  
The S ponsor ran this study at 48 locations in 13 countries around the world.  398men 
and 43women participated.  All patients were between the ages of 46and 89.

4Patients were to be treated for 30 months (2.5 years) .Of the 441patients who started 
the study, 258 finished the study .  183patients did not finish the study by their choice 
or a doctor decided it was best for a patient to stop the study ,or because they died 
from causes not related to taking the study drug .
When the study ended in February 2018, the Sponsor began reviewing the 
infor mation collected.  The Sponsor then cr eated a report of the results. This is a 
summary of that report.
