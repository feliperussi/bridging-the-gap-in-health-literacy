4There were other criteria patients had to have to be a part of the study in addition to 
the ones listed above.  These were just some of the main criteria patients had to hav e. 
This study compared 2 groups of patients.  One group was treated with PF -05280586.  
The other group was treated with rituximab.
The patients and researchers did not know who took PF -05280586 and who took 
rituximab.  This is known as a “blinded” study. This was done to make sure the trial 
results were not influenced in any way.  
Patients were put into 1 of 2 treatment groups by chance alone.  This is known as a 
“randomized” study.  This is done to make the groups more similar, which makes 
comparing the groups more fair. 
The figure below shows a summary of what happened during the study.
While patients were in the study for a year, the entire study took about 3 ½ years to 
complete.  Patients joined the study at 1 of 160 locations in 29 countries in Eu rope, 
Asia, North America, and South America.  It began 30 September 2014 and ended 
19April 2018.  178 men and 216 women participated.  All patients were between the 
ages of 21 and 93 years old.

5Patients were supposed to be treated until they got 4 weekly treatments with either 
PF-05280586 or rituximab.  Of the 394 patients who started the study, 393 patients 
got at least 1 dose of either study medicine.  1 patient left the study before getting any 
study medicine.  390 patients finished the 4 weekly cycles of study medicine.  
340patients completed the entire study.  This means that they completed all of the 
visits in the study including the Week 52 visit.  54 patients did not finish the Week 52 
visit.  They left before the study was over by their choice, o r a doctor decided it was 
best for a patient to stop the study.
When the study ended in April 2018, the Sponsor began reviewing the information 
collected.  The Sponsor then created a report of the results. This is a summary of that 
report.
