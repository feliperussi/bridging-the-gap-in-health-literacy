This study compar ed 3groups of patients to find out if patients taking tanezumab 
would have an improvement in osteoarthritis symptoms .  To answer the research 
question, the researchers looked at 3 smaller questions :
Change in amount of pain due to osteo arthritis, from before study treatment to 
week 16 of the study.
Change in amount of physical difficulty due to osteo arthritis, from before study 
treatment to week 16 of the study.
Change in overall functioning, from before study treatment to week 16 of the 
study.

3The stud y included adult patients with osteoarthritis in the hip or knee, who did not 
get adequate pain relief from certain other pain medicines, or who were unable or 
unwilling to take certain other pain medicines . 
First, p atients were screened by the study doctor to make sure they were appropriate
to join the study.  This was known as the “ screening pe riod”, which lasted up to 
37days.  During this time, X -rays of the joints were taken, and osteoarthritis pain was 
assessed.
The next part of the study was the “treatment period” , which lasted 16 weeks. 
Patients were assigned to 1 of 3 treatment groups.  Patients were assigned to each 
group by chance alone. Putting people into groups by chance helps make the groups 
more similar so they can be compared.
Study treatments were given as an injection under the skin (subcutaneously) . Patients 
received a total of 2 injections during the study, 1 on the first day of the study and a 
second one 8 weeks later .
The study treatment s included:  
Group 1: Tanezumab 2.5 mg (day 1) , and tanezumab 5 mg (week 8)
Group 2: Tanezumab 2.5 mg (day 1), and tanezumab 2.5 mg (week 8)
Group 3: Placebo (day 1), and placebo (week 8)
The patients and researchers did not know who took tanezumab and wh o took the 
placebo ,since all treatment options looked the same .  This is known as a “blinded” 
study.  
At study visits in the clinic, starting at the screening visit, the patients completed 
questionnaires, like the questionnaires about pain from osteoarth ritis, physical 
disability from osteoarthritis, and overall well -being that were used to answer the 
research question. They also let the staff know about illnesses and discomforts, and 
had assessments (like physical exam, blood pressure, and more) done by the study 
doctors and other qualified personnel.

4Finally , there was a follow -up period, which lasted 24 weeks.  During this time, the 
study doctors monitored the patients for any medical problems.  The figure below
shows what happened during this study.
While patients were only in the study for about 40 weeks , the entire study took almost 
2 ½ years to complete.  The Sponsor ran this study at 73locations in Canada and the 
United States .  It began 21 January 2016 and ended 14 May 2018 .  243men (35%)and
453women (65%) participated.  All patients were between the ages of 27 and 85 . 
Patients were to be treated for 16 weeks and complete the 24 -week follow -up period . 
A total of 69 6patient s joined the study and received study treatment.  Of the se 
patients ,582(84%) finished the study .  There were 114 patients (16%) who left before 
the study was over by their choice or a doctor decided it was best for a patient to stop 
the study.
When the study ended in May 2018 , the Sponsor began reviewing the infor mation
collected.  The Sponsor then cr eated a report of the results. This is a summary of that 
report.
