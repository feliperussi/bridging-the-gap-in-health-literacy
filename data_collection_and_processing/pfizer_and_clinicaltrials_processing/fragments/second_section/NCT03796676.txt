This study compared 3 groups of patients to find out if patients treated with 100 mg 
or 200 mg of abrocit inibonce daily were more likely to have their AD improve 
compared to patients taking a placebo.  A placebo does not have any medicine in it, 
but it looks just like the study medicine. 
The study included adolescent boys and girls who were at least 12 year s oldand up to
18years old .  Patients included in the study:
Had a confirmed diagnosis of moderate to severe AD when they entered the 
study.
Also had one of the following: 
oHad been treated up to 6 months earlier for AD with medicines 
applied to the skin for at least 4 weeks , and their AD did not get better;
oHad n eeded to use medicines that reach all parts of the body to control 
their AD in the last 6 months (for example, taking medicines by 
mouth) , or were eligible to take these medicines .
Had used moist urizing products on their skin (such as skin cream) that did 
not contain medicine at least twice daily for the 7 days before starting the 
study treatments.
Were willing to use standard skin treatments for AD during the study (called 
‘topical background the rapy’) .
Had not taken medications like abrocitinib before ( known as systemic JAK 
inhibitors).
The patients and doctors did not know who took abrocitinib and who took the 
placebo.  This is known as a “double -blinded” study.  This is done to make sure the 
results of the research study cannot be unfairly influenced by anyone .  Patients were 
assigned to 1 of 3 treatment groups by chance (like the flip of a coin or drawing straws) 
to receive either abrocitinib at a dose of 100 mg, abrocitinib at a dose of 200 mg,or 
placebo.  This is known as a “randomized and placebo -controlled ” study.
All of the patients in this study were treated with medicated topical therapy while 
taking abrocitinib or placebo.

4The researchers in this study used 2 different tests to mea sure the severity of the 
patients’ AD at the beginning of the study and throughout 12 weeks of treatment.  
The first test is called the Investigators Global Assessment (IGA) scale and measures 
the severity of AD on a 5 -point scale (0 being the best and 4 b eing the worst).  The 
second test is called the Eczema Area and Severity Index, and measures how severe a 
patient’s AD is based on 4 different signs, as well as the amount of skin affected by 
AD.  The difference in each patient’s score between the start of the study and after 
12weeks of treatment was used to decide if their AD had improved.
While patients were only in the study for 12 to 16 weeks , the entire study took almost 
14months to complete.  The Sponsor ran this study at 99locations in 13countries in
Europe, Asia, Australia, and North America .  It began on18February 2019 and 
ended on08April 2020.  A total of 145 boys and 140 girls participated.  All patients 
were between the ages of 11and 18. 
Patients were to be treated until the en d of the 12 week treatment period .  Of the 
285patients who started the study, 273finished the study .  Five (5 )patients did not 
finish the study because of medical problems. Seven (7) patients left before the study

5was over by their choice or their pare nt’s choice, or because a doctor decided it was 
best for a patient to stop being in the study.
When the study ended in April 2020 , the Sponsor began reviewing the information 
collected.  The Sponsor then created a report of the results.  This is a summary of that 
report.
