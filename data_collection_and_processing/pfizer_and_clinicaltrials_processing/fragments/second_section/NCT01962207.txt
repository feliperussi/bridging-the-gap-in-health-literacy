2years old ( 76children)
Group 2: Children who received Meningitec when they were between 1 and
2years old ( 23children)

(115children)
Group 4: Children who received Mencevax when they were 2 to 10 years ol d 
(29children)
The children were asked to come to up to 5 visits, each a year apart, at the study 
center.  This was known as the “persistence phase” of the study.  During these visits, 
the researchers collected blood samples from the children.  The resear chers looked 
for antibodies in the blood against the 4 different types of meningococcus germ.   
181 c hildren received a booster dose of Nimenrix at study visit 5. This was known as 
the “booster phase” of the study.
