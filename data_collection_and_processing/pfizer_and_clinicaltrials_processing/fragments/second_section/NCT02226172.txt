First researchers checked to see if patients were eligible to enter the study at the 
Screening visit.  Next, eligible patients were enrolled into the “Lead In” phase of the 
study and started the study medicin e, glasdegib at the Baseline visit.   Over the course 
of the glasdegib treatment patients were evaluated for safety and remained on 
treatment for as long as they tolerated and derived clinical benefit from the treatment 
as determined by their study doctor.
The picture below shows what happened during the study.

4Although the safety of 
glasdegib was considered 
acceptable in “Lead -In” phase 
of the study, the study did not 
proceed into the “Randomized” 
phase because glasdegib did not 
appear to reduce the spleen 
volume.
While patients were only in the study for about 8 months, the entire study took 
4years to complete.  Some patients were in the study for longer than 8 months 
because they took the medicine as long as they were having clinical benefit from the 
study medicine.  
The sponsor ran this study at 10 locations in 2 countries, in Japan and the United 
States .  It began 06 October 2014 and ended 31 October 2018.  13 men and 8 women 
participated.  All patients were between the ages of 58 and 83 years.
Patients were supposed to be treated with glasdegib for at least 6 months. Of the 
21patients who started the study, 4 finished the 6 months of treatment with 
glasdegib.  17 patients did not finish the study.  1 patient died before finishing the 
study due to progression of their disease.  12 patients did not finish the study because 
they discontinued due to a medical problem they experienced.  4 patients left before

5the study was over by their choice or a doctor decided it was best for a patient to stop
the study.
When the study ended in October 2018, the Sponsor reviewed the information 
collected.  The Sponsor then created a report of the results. This is a summary of that 
report.
