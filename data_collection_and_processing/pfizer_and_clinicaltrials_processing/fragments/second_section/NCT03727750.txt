How was the study done?
Researchers t ested GO on a group of study participants with CD33 -positive AML to
find out if study participants taking GO had a change in their heart function. 
This was an “open -label” study, which means that the researchers and the participants 
knew what study medication they were receiving. Apart from GO, participants also 
received their normal medications to relieve their cancer symptoms . Participants were 
also given medicines to help reduce symptoms such as fever and chills, known as 
“infusion reactions ”, before receiving GO.
Before being included in the study, participants were “screened” to see if they qualify 
to be in the study. During screening, a bone marrow or blood sampl es was collected 
to see if participants had CD33 on their cancer cells. 
Participants were given 3mg/m2of GOvia intravenous (IV) infusion (using a “drip”) 
on Days 1, 4 and 7 per cycle for 1or 2cycles . Infusion of the study medication took 
about 2hours on each day . Some participants received GOfor 1cycle, and others for 
2cycles, depending on what the research doctors felt was best, and how what side 
effects the participants were having due to receiving GO.

Participants returned to the study un it for tests and biological sample collection on 
Days 10, 15 and 21 of each cycle , and had a final end-of-treatment (EoT) visit, 
36days after the last dose of GO , or start of new/other anticancer treatment.
After the EoT visit ,participants were monitored every 12weeks for 12 months, either 
via phone call or by being asked to return to the study unit for assessments ,during a 
Follow -up Period.
Participants had regular ECGs to monitor changes in their heart .Participants also had 
other tests, and blood sam ples collected to monitor their safety, check the level of 
GO in their blood and how GO was processed by their body . Some participants also 
had urine samples collected. Participants were also asked about how well they were 
feeling, and about any other medi cations they were taking.

Who participated in this study?
A total of 66 potential participants were screened to see if they qualify to be in the 
study. 
In total, 52 participants (51 adults and 1 teenager ) who had CD33 -positive AML that 
was either relapsed or refractory ,qualified to be in the study .Only results for the 
51adult participants are shown in this report. 
Participants included in the study also met specific criteria with regards to the status 
of their leukemia, their heart rate measurements (specifically, QT interval), and their
current and previous treatments for their cancer . 
A total of 31 men participated
A total of 20 women participated
All participants were between the ages of 22years and82years.
Of the 51 adult participants in the study , 50 participants received at least 1 dose of 
study medication . One participant did not receive any treatment.
Of the 50 participants who received study medication:
46of the 50 participants (92%) completed Cycle 1 treatment, and
9 of the 50 participants (18%) completed Cycle 2 treatment .
Two of the participants did not complete the ir assigned treatment due to medical 
problems . 
All 51participants (including the 1 participant who did not receive any study 
medication) entered the follow -up part of the study. Most of the participants (49 of

the 51 participants [96%] ) did not complete the follow -up part of the study, due to the 
following reasons:
Participant passed away : 45of the 51 participants (88%)
Participant decided they did not want to be in the study anymore : 2 of the 
51participants (4%)
Researchers were unable to contact the participant: 1 of the 51 participant s(2%)
Other reason: 1 of the 51 participant s(2%)
How long did the study last?
Study participants were in the study for about 12 months . The entire study took 1year 
and 9 months to complete.
When the study ended in April 2021 , the Sponsor began reviewing the information 
collected . The Sponsor then created a report of the results . This is a summary of that 
report.
