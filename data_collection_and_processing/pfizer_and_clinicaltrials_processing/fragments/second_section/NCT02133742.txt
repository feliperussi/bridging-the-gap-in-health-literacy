How was the study done?
This study had two parts: the dose finding part and the dose expansion part.
Researchers wanted to know:
How safe was the combination of Axitinib and MK -3475 for 
participants with advanced renal cell cancer?
What medical problems did participants have during the study?

Researchers tested 2 different doses of Axitinib in combination with 2 milligrams per 
kilogram each participant weighed (also called “mg/kg”) of MK -3475 on a group of 
participants with advanced renal cell cancer to learn how safe the combination of 
Axitinib and MK -3475.
In the dose finding part of the s tudy, participants were to take Axitinib at a dose of 
5mg by mouth, twice a day.  Participants were also to take 2 mg/kg MK -3475 inside 
the vein (IV).  After 3 weeks, the participants either continued taking the 5 mg dose of 
Axitinib or were switched to t he 3 mg dose of Axitinib. 
The participants and researchers knew who took the 5 mg dose of Axitinib and who 
took 3 mgdose of Axitinib.  All participants knew they were taking MK -3475. This is 
known as an “open -label” study.  Participants were assigned to each group by their 
doctor based on each participant’s condition.
During the dose expansion part of the study, the participants from the dose finding 
part of the study continued to take these medications at the dose chosen by their 
doctors.  New patients also joined the study and were given 1 of the 2 doses of 
Axitinib as chosen by their doctors. 
Researchers took samples of blood and urine from participants once every 3 weeks 
during both the dose finding and dose expansion parts of the study and measured the 
amounts of Axitinib and MK -3475.  Researchers also checked the participants’ health 
during the study and asked them how they were feeling. 
Researchers then compared the number of participants that had certain medical 
problems in the Axitinib 5 mg to t he participants taking Axitinib 3 mg.

Who participated in this study?
The study included participants who were at least 18 years old, had advanced renal cell 
cancer, and at least 1 tumour their doctor could measure. 
A total of 41 men participated
A total of 11 women participated
All participants were between the ages of 28 and 75 years
Participants were to be treated until their cancer got worse, they chose to leave the 
study, or a doctor decided it was best for them to stop being in the study.  Of the 
52participants who started the study, no patients were still cont inuing in the study at 
the time of this report. 
How long did the study last?
The amount of time that study participants were in the study varied depending on 
their response to the study treatment, but the entire study took 58 months to 
complete.
When the study ended in July 2019, the Sponsor began reviewing the information 
collected.  The Sponsor then created a report of the results.  This is a summary of that 
report.
