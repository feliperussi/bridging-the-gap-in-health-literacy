This study compared 4groups of patients to find out if patients taking tanezumab 
would have an improvement in chronic low back pain symptoms .  To answer the 
research question, the researcher s asked patients to rate their lower back pain each 
day, on a scale of 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst possible pain) .
The study included adult patients with chronic lower back pain that has been going on 
at least 3 months , who did not get adequate pain relief from certain other pain 
medicines .  These patients had a back pain rating of 5 or more , ona scale from 0 
to10,at the beginning of the study.
First, p atients were screened by the study doctor to make sure they were appropriate
to join the study.  This w as known as the “ screening pe riod”, which lasted up to 
37days.  During this time, X -rays of the knees, hip joints ,and shoulder joints were 
taken , and lower back pain was assessed.
The next part of the study was the “treatment period” , which lasted up to 56weeks.

3The treatments used in this study included:
Tanezumab 5 mg, given as an injection under the skin every 8 weeks
Tanezumab 10 mg, given as an injection under the skin every 8 weeks
A placebo that looks like tanezumab, given as an injection under the skin every 
8 weeks
A medicine called tramadol that is used to treat chronic lower back pain, given 
as a pill by mouth e very day
A placebo pill that looks like the tramadol pill, taken by mouth e very day
Patients were assigned to 1 of 4treatment groups.  Patients were assigned to each 
group by chance alone.  Putting people into groups by chance helps make the groups 
more similar so they can be compared. 
Each group received the following treatments :  
Group 1: Placebo injection + placeb o pillfor the first 16 weeks.  After 
16weeks, patients were switched to tanezumab 5 mg or 10 mg injections ,
+placebo pill
Group 2: Tanezumab 5 mg injection + placebo pill
Group 3:  Tanezumab 10 mg injection + placebo pill
Group 4: Tramadol pill+ placebo injection
The patients and researchers did not know who took the tanezumab injection or the 
placebo injection and who took the tramadol pill or the placebo pill,since these
treatment slooked the same .  This is known as a “blinded” study.  
At study visits in the clinic, starting at the screening visit, the patients completed 
questionnaires about their low back pain .They also let the staff know about illnesses 
and discomforts, and had assessments (like physical exam, blood pressure, and more) 
done b y the study doctors and other qualified personnel.
During the stud y visits for week 16 and week 32 , the study doctor assessed whether 
the patients should continue in the study, based on their low back pain ratings.  To 
continue in the study, patients shoul d have at least 30% improvement in pain ratings
after 16 weeks of treatment .  Patients who did not have at least 30% improvement 
stopped study treatment and entered the follow -up period.

4The follow -up period lasted 24 weeks.  During this time, the study doctors monitored 
the patients for any medical problems.  The figure below shows what happened 
during this study.
Each patient participated inthe study for up to 80 weeks , and the entire study took 
about 3½ years to complete.  The Sponsor ran this study at 191doctor’s offices and 
clinics inEurope, Asia, and North America .  It began 18August 2015and ended 
20December 2018.  784men (43%)and 1041 women (57%) participated.  All 
patients were between the ages of 19and 8 4. 
Patients were to be treated for up to 56 weeks and complete the 24 -week follow -up 
period . A total of 1825 patient s joined the study and received study treatment.  Of 
these patients ,1181 (65%) finished the study .  There were 644patients (35%)who left 
before the study was over by their choice or because they had a medical problem and 
a doctor decided it was best for a patient to stop the study.
When the study ended in December 2018, the Sponsor began reviewing the 
infor mation collected.  The Sponsor then cr eated a report of the results. This is a 
summary of that report.
