This study compared 2groups of patients .  Researchers wanted to find out if 
PF-05280014 worked similarly to Herceptin®in patients with breast cancer.   
Thisstudy included adult women who:
Had newly diagnosed, early breast cancer
Did not receive prior treatment for the irbreast cancer
Planned to get surgery for the irbreast cancer tumor after chemotherapy
The patients and researchers did not know who took PF-05280014 and who took 
Herceptin®.  This is known as a “ double -blinded” study.   Researchers use 
“double -blinded” studies to make sure that the results of the study are not influenced 
in any way.  Patients were put into 1 of 2 treatment groups by chance alone .  This is 
known as a “randomized” study.  This is done to make the groups more similar for 
things like age and race. Reducing differences between the groups makes the groups 
more even to compare.  Patients had a 50% chance (1 in 2chances , likethe flip of a 
coin) of getting either treatment.
For 4 weeks, patients were checked (screened) to make sure they met all the 
requirements to be in the study.  Then, patients were put into 1 of 2 groups and were 
given 6 cycles of treatment.  Each cyc le occurred every 3 weeks.  After taking the 
study medicines, patients were followed by researchers for 4 weeks (follow -up phase) 
to see how they did after taking study medicines.
While patients were only in the study for about 7 months , the entire study t ook
17months to complete.  Pfizer ran this study at 46locations in 10countries in
Europe and the United States .  It began 23September 2014 and ended 
09March 2016. 226women participated.   1patient was randomized, but did not 
receive any study drug. All patients were between the ages of 24and 79.

4Thediagram below shows what ha ppened to patients in the study.
Patients were supposed to be treated through 6cycles of treatment. Of the
225patients who got at least 1 cycle of treatment , 215finished the study .  10patients 
left before the study was over by their choice or because a doctor decided it was best 
fora patient to stop the study.
When the study ended inMarch 2016, Pfizer began reviewing the infor mation 
collected.  Pfizer then cr eated a report of the results. The following is a summary of 
that report.
