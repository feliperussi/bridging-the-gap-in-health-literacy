This study included patients who were treated with both crisabo role and plain 
ointment on 2 different areas of the skin.  The areas of skin were then compared to 
see if atopic dermatitis symptoms would improve in the areas that were treated with 
crisaborole.
The study included adult patients with atopic dermatitis.  To join the study, patients 
must have had at least 2 areas of atopic dermatitis that were 3 centimeters x 
3centimeters or larger, and at least 5 centimeters apart.  Symptoms must have started

3at least 6 months before the study began, and must have been st able for at least 
1month. 
Patients were screened by the study doctor to make sure they were able to join the 
study.  This was known as the “screening period”, which lasted up to 30 days.  
Patients then entered the “double -blind” treatment period, which lasted 15 days.  
Double -blind means that patients and doctors did not know which area of skin was 
treated with which medicine.  This was done to make sure that the trial results were 
not infl uenced in any way.   For each patient, 1 area of skin was treated with 
crisaborole, and 1 area of skin was treated with plain ointment. Patients came to the 
study center twice per day during this part of the study, so that they could receive 
treatment and be checked by the study doctor.
On day 15 of the study, samples of the treated skin were collected to be used for 
testing.  Patients then entered the “open -label” treatment period, which lasted another 
28 days until day 43 of the study.  During this part o f the study, patients stopped 
using the plain ointment and could use crisaborole to treat all areas of the skin 
affected by atopic dermatitis (except the scalp).  Open -label means that patients and 
doctors knew which medicine was being used.
Patients recei ved a follow -up phone call on day 71 to check for any medical problems.  
This was considered the end of the study.
The figure below shows what happened during this study.

4While patients were only in the study for 71 days, the entire study lasted about 
9months from start to finish .  The sponsor ran this study at 1 location in Canada.  It 
began 31 July 2017 and ended 4 May 2018 .  A total of 13 men (33%) and 27 women 
(68%) participated.  All patients were between the ages of 18 and 57. 
Patients were expe cted to complete a 15 -day double -blind treatment period followed 
by a 28 -day open -label treatment period.  Of the 40 patients who started the study, 
38(95%) completed the study. 2 patients (5%) did not finish the study because they 
had a medical problem t hat was not considered related to the study treatment. 
When the study ended in May 2018, the Sponsor began reviewing the information 
collected.  The Sponsor then created a report of the results.  This is a summary of that 
report.
