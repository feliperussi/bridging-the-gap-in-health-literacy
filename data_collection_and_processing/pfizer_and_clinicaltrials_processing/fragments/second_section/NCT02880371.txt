This study included patients who met the following conditions:
Aged 18 years or older
For Phase 1:
oDiagnosed with one of certain types of cancer, such as of the ovaries, 
breast, head and neck, bladder, colon, pancreas, stomach, skin, or lung
oCancer had not responded to standard treatment, was not currently 
treatable, or the patient had refused standard treatment
For Phase 2:
oAdvanced solid tumor cancer that had gotten worse while being treated 
with certain typ es of anti -cancer therapy (called “PD -1/PD -L1 inhibitor 
resistant”)
oAdvanced cancer of the ovaries, abdomen (peritoneum), or fallopian 
tubes that got worse within 6 months of being treated with ≥ 4 cycles of 
platinum -based chemotherapy (called “platinum -resistant”)
oAdvanced pancreatic cancer (PDS) that had been treated at least once 
before
Able to walk around, take care of themselves, and do light house work or office 
work
Had adequate kidney, liver, bone marrow, and heart function
Had not been treated bef ore with cancer medications called ‘checkpoint 
inhibitors’ (such as a PD -1, PD -L1, or CTLA -4 inhibitor)
This was an “open -label” study, which means that the patients and doctors knew what 
dose of ARRY -382 and pembrolizumab the patients were receiving. 
What happened during Phase 1 of the study?
Phase 1 of this study compared 3 groups of patients that were assigned to 1 of 3 doses 
of ARRY -382 (either 200 mg, 300 mg, or 400 mg per day) to find the recommended 
dose of ARRY -382 for the Phase 2 portion of the study.  The figure below shows 
what happened during Phase 1 of the study.

4During Phase 1, each patient took 1 of 3 doses of ARRY -382 in pill form, once daily 
by mouth for 21 days.  The patients were also treated with pembrolizumab IV once 
every 3 weeks and monitored for medical problems.
What happened during Phase 2 of the study?
Phase 2 of this study compared 3 groups of patients with different types of cancer to 
see if their cancer got better with ARRY -382 and pembrolizumab treatment.  Based 
on the Pha se 1 results, all of the patients in Phase 2 were assigned to take 200 mg 
ARRY -382 once daily.  The figure below shows what happened during Phase 2 of the 
study.

5While many patients were only in the study for a few months, the entire study took 
just over 3years to complete.  The Sponsor ran this study at 15 locations in the 
United States of America.  It began on 01 September 2016 and ended 
24October 2019.  A total of 10 men and 9 women participated in Phase 1 and 
22men and 35 women participated in Phas e 2.  All patients were between the ages of 
30 and 8 7. 
Patients were to be treated until their cancer stopped responding or got worse, until 
they developed unacceptable medical problems, or until they chose to stop treatment.  
All patients who started Pha se 1 or Phase 2 of the study stopped taking the study 
medicines before the study ended.  Most patients left before the study was over 
because their cancer had gotten worse, by their choice, or because a doctor decided it 
was best for a patient to stop bein g in the study.

6This study was stopped when early results showed that too few patients had their 
cancer get better when taking ARRY -382 and pembrolizumab.  When the study ended 
in October 2019, the Sponsor reviewed the information collected.  The Sponsor t hen 
created a report of the results.  This is a summary of that report.
