This study looked at how HSP -130 affects the b ody.  The study included women with 
breast cancer wh o had never before taken chemotherapy.  This was an “open -label” 
study, which means that both the patients and researchers knew what treatment was 
being given.

3Since t he study was divided into 2 parts , each patient took part in only Part 1 or 
Part2.  Patients were checked by the study doctor to make sure they were a good fit 
to join the study .  This was called “screening ”.
Part 1 -Without Chemotherapy
Part 1 lasted about 30 days and i ncluded 12 patients with breast cancer .  The first 
6patients receive d 1dose ( 3 mg )of HSP -130. The next 6 patients received
1dose (6mg)of HSP -130.  HSP-130was given as an injection just under the skin.  
The researchers tested patients’ blood throughout the study to seehow the body 
responds to the HSP-130, and to decide if the lower dose (3 mg) would be used
during Part 2 of the study .
Part 2 -With Chemotherapy
Part 2 lasted about 94days and include d 13 patients who ha dalready had surgery for 
their breast cancer .  This part of the study was divided into 4 “chemotherapy 
treatment cycles” that each lasted about 3 weeks .  During each cycle, patients received 
1dose ( 6 mg )of HSP -130(for a total of 4 doses), and chemotherapy as prescribed by 
their study doctor. The researchers tested patients’ blood throug hout the study to 
learn how the body responds to the HSP-130.

4While patients were only in the study for about 1 month (Part 1) or 4 months (Part 2) , 
the entire study took about 2 years to complete.   Patients joined the study at 1 of 7 
locations in Hungary and Spain.  It began 21 December 2015 and ended 05 October 
2017.  A total of 25 women between the ages of 39 and 78 participated.  All 
25patients (100%) completed the study. When the study ended inOctober 2017 , the 
Sponsor review edthe total infor mation collected during the study .  The Sponsor then 
created a report of the results. This is a summary of that report.
