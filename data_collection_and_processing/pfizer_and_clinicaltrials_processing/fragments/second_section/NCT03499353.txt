How was the study done?
Participants we re checked (screened) to make sure they were a good fit for the study. 
Participants received 1 milligram (mg) talazoparib once per day by mouth, for 
24weeks (participants with kidney disease received a lower dose, 0.75 mg talazoparib).  
Within 6 weeks of finishing talazoparib treatment, participants had surgery and study 
doctors took tissue samples to evaluate and remove breast cancer.
This was an “open -label” study, which means that the participants and doctors knew 
which treatment and dose they received.   Researchers wanted to know: 
How many participants had a pathologic complete response 
(complete disappearance of cancer at surgery) after 24 weeks of 
treatment with talazoparib followed by surgery?

Participants joined the study and received talazoparib for 24 weeks and were expected 
to attend a follow -up visit about 4 weeks later. Within 6 weeks of completing 
talazoparib treatment, participants had surgery (if appropriate) followed by another 
follow-up visit 4 weeks later.  Participants were thereafter contacted by phone about 
every 12 weeks for the remainder of the study.
The figure below shows what happened during this study.
Where did this study take place? 
The Sponsor ran this study at 18 locations in the United States.
When did this study take place?
It began on 27 August 2018 and ended 23 September 2020. 
Who participated in this study?
This study included adult participants who:
Had HER2 negative (HER2 is a type of protein receptor that may be on the 
surface of cancer cells) or early invasive triple -negative breast cancer
Had a BRCA 1 or BRCA 2 gene mutation 
Were appropriate to receive treatment prior to surgery
Had breast cancer which had not spread to parts of the body that are f ar away

Had not received other cancer treatment within the past 3 years (with the 
exception of treatments for breast cancer of the milk ducts only)
Had adequate ki dney, liver, and bone marrow function
A total of 61 women participated
No men participated  
All participants were between the ages of 26 and 75 years 
Participants received talazoparib treatment for 24 weeks.  Of the 61 participants who 
started the study , 45 participants (74%) completed talazoparib treatment.
A total of 16 participants (2 6%) stopped taking talazoparib early
by their choice, 
because their breast cancer was worsening,
because they had a medical problem, or
because a doctor decided it was best for them to stop talazoparib
How long did the study last?
The amount of time that each participant was in this study varied.  The entire study 
took about 2 years to complete.
After the last participant's surgical safety follow -up was completed, the st udy ended in 
September 2020, and the Sponsor began reviewing the information collected.  The 
Sponsor then created a report of the results.  This is a summary of that report.
