3join this study .All the children were healthy and had received 2 injections (primary 
injection plus booster injection) of Nimenrix orMeningitec during the previous 
studies.
The children did not receive any study vaccinations or other medicines during this 
study, since they had already received either Nimenrix or Meningitec during the 
previous studies .  Instead, the children were asked to come to up to 5 visits, each a 
year apart, at the study center.  During these visits, the researchers collected blood 
samples from the children.  The researchers looked for antibodies in the blood against 
the 4 differ ent types of meningococcus germ.
This was an “open label” study, which means that the children, their 
parents/guardians, and the researchers knew which vaccine the children received 
during the previous studies.
