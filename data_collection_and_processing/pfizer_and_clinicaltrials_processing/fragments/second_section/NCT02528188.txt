This study compared 3 groups of patients to find out if patients receiving a 
“subcutaneous injection ” or shot of tanezumab that was given under the skin every 
8 weeks had the same safety and pain relief compared to patients taking a comparator 
medicine .  In this study, th e comparator medicine was tablets or capsules of NSAIDs  
that were to be taken twice a day .  The NSAIDs were naproxen 500  mg, celecoxib 
100 mg, or diclo fenac ER 75 mg.   
The study included patients with  osteoarthritis of the hip or knee who were 18 years 
of age or older and who were taking NSAIDs for their osteoarthritis because 
acetaminophen (also known as paracetamol) had not provided enough pain relief .  
The patient  also had to be unable to take tramadol or opioids for pain relief or had 
tried these treatments but found they did not work , or was unwilling to take opioids.   
The patients and researchers did not know who took tanezumab  and who took the 
comparator  treatment in this study .  This is known as a “blinded” stu dy.  Studies  such  
 3 as this will often use a “placebo” to help evaluate drug effects.  A placebo does not 
have any medicine in it, but looks just like the medicine being studied.  In this study, 
placebo treatment was given as either an injection , tablets or capsules so that everyone 
in the study received an injection (tanezumab or placebo) every 8 weeks and tablets or 
capsules  (placebo or NSAIDs) that they had to take twice a day.  Patients  were put 
into 1 of 3 treatment groups by chance alone  (see table below) .  This is known as a 
“randomized” study.  Putting people into groups by chance helps to make the groups more equal and easier to compare.

 4 While patients were only in the study for about 21 months (80 weeks), the entire study 
took over 3 and a half years to complete.  The sponsor ran this study at 307 locations in 17 countries in Europe, North and South America, and in the Asia -Pacific area.  It 
began on 21  July 2015  and ended on 27 February 2019.  1043 men and 1953 women 
participated.  All patients were between the ages of 28 and 90 years.  
Patients were to be treated for up to 56 weeks and this was then followed by a 
24-week safety follow -up period when the patients were observed and no treatment 
was given (total of 80 weeks).  Of the 2996 patients who started the study an d 
received at least 1  injection in the study, 1312  patients finished the treatment period 
and 1684 patients did not finish the treatment period.  A total of 2227  patients 
completed the safety follow -up part of the study, whether or not they completed the 
treatment period.  A total of 769  patients left before the study was over by their 
choice or a doctor decided it was best for a patient to stop the study.  
When the study ended in February 2019, the Sponsor began reviewing the 
infor mation collected.  The Sponsor then cr eated a report of the results.  This is a 
summary of that report.
