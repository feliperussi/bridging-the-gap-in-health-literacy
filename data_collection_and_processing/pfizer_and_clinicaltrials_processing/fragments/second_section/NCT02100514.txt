Researchers wanted to know if patients taking a statin who took bococizumab had 
lower LDL cholesterol than patients who took a placebo .  A placebo does not have 
any medicine in it, but looks just likethe medicine being tested .
Thisstudy included adult men and women who:
Had high cholesterol that require dmedicine to treat
Were already taking a statin treatment for at least 6 weeks, and did not plan 
to change or stop taking their statin
Had a high or very high risk of heart disease because of other health 
problems, like smoking, diabetes, or damage to their blood vessels
Patients were assigned either bococizumab or placebo treatment by chance alone.  
This is known as a “randomized” study.  This is done to make the groups more 
similar for things like age and the number of men and women. Reducing differences 
between the groups makes the groups more even to compare.  
The patients ,study doctors ,and Sponsor did not know who took what medicine 
during the study.  This is known as a “double -blinded” study .  Researche rs use 
“double -blinded” studies to make sure that the results are not influenced in any way.
Descriptions of Medicines Given in Each Group
Group Medicines Given Why the Group Was Used in this Study
1 Bococizumab 150 mg To see if bococizumab lowered LDL cholesterol
2 Bococizumab placeboTo compare bococizumab with taking noother 
medicine besides their statin
For 4 weeks, patients were checked (screened) to make sure they met all the needs to 
be in the study.  Next, patients were put into 1 of the 2treatment groups and were 
treated for 1 year.  Twice as many patient swere assigned bococizumab as placebo (a

42:1 ratio).  At the end of 1 year, patients were followed by researchers for 6 weeks 
(follow -up phase) to see how they did after taking the study medicines .
While each patient was only in the study for about 14 months, t he whole study took 
almost 2 years to finish.  Of the 746patients who started the study, 643finished the 
whole study .  103 patients left before the study was over by their choice or a doctor 
decided it was best for a patient to stop the study.   2 patients died in the bococizumab 
group, and 2 patients died in the placebo group.  Study doctors and the Spons or 
determined that s tudy medicines did not cause their deaths.  
The study took place at 17 0locations in 12 countries in North America and Western 
Europe, Easter nEurope, and Asia.  It began on 28 October 2014 and ended 
15July2016.  746 patients started this study.  416 patients were men and 330 patients 
were women.  All patients were between the ages of 26 and 86.
As soon as the study ended in July 2016 , the Sponsor began looking at the study 
results .  The Sponsor then cr eated a report of the results. This is a summary of that 
report.
