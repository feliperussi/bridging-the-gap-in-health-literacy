This study evaluated a group of patients who received dacomitin ib in previous studies 
for advanced NSCLC, to have them continue treatment with dacomitinib.

3strengths of dacomitinib oral tablets were planned:
45 mg per day
30 mg per day
15 mg per day
The dose strength patients started on in this study, was the same as the dose the 
patient ended on in the previous study.  There were 7 patients included in this study; 
5patients started at a dose of 15 mg once a day and 2 patients started at a dose of 
30mg once a day.
This was an “open -label” study, which means that the patients and the researchers 
knew which medicine the patients received.
The figure below shows what happened during the study.

4Three (3) men and 4 women participated.  All patients were between the ages of 68 
and 76 and had an average weight of 56 kg.  The study doctor was allowed to change 
the strength of the dacomitinib dose during the study, depending on how the 
treatment made the patients feel.
Patients were to be treate d until there was evidence of the study drug helping to relief 
NSCLC symptoms, as determined by the study doctor.  All 7 patients left before the 
study was over by their choice or a doctor decided it was best for a patient to stop 
being in the study, of wh ich 3 patients left as dacomitinib became available on the 
market.
