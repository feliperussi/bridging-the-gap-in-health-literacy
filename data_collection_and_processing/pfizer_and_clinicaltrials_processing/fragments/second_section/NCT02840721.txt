All 50 patients who were enrolled in this study received the investigational medicine. 
The study included men and women with moderate to severe UC who:
Were between the ages of 18 and 75
Were diagnosed with UC 4 or more months before entering the study
Had active disease above the rectum (the lowest part of the large intestines)
Were unable to tolerate, did not respond to, or lost response to at least 
1conventional therapy for UC (such as steroids, medications that suppress the 
immune system, or anti -TNF/anti -integrin inhibitors)
Did not have another medical condition that could be made worse by 
treatment with the study medication
This study consisted of a screening period, a treatment period, and a follow -up period.

In this study, “improvement” in a patient’s UC was measured using a test called the 
Mayo endoscopic subscore.  This test measures how severe a patient’s UC is on a 
scale of 0 to 3 (0 being the best and 3 being the worst).  Improvement was defined as 
reaching a Mayo endoscopic subscore of “0” or “1”.
While patients were only in the study for 8 months, the entire study took 2 years to 
complete.  The Sponsor ran this study at 13 locations in 6 countries in North

4America, Europe, and Asia.  It began on 26 October 2016 and ended 22 August 2018.  
28men and 22 women participated.  All patients were between the ages of 20 and 68. 
Patients were to be treated until 14 weeks after their last dose of the investigational 
medicine, or until 2 or more patients devel oped the same serious medical problem or 
an abnormal heartbeat.  Of the 50 patients who started the study, 42 finished the 
follow -up period.  1 patient did not finish the study because the study medication 
wasn’t working, and 1 patient did not finish the s tudy because of a medical problem.  
6 patients left before the study was over by their choice or a doctor decided it was 
best for a patient to stop being in the study.
When the study ended in August 2018, the Sponsor began reviewing the information 
collect ed.  The Sponsor then created a report of the results.  This is a summary of that 
report.
