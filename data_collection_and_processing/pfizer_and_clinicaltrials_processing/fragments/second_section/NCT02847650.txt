This study compared 2 groups of patients to find out if motor symptoms would 
decrease in patients taking PF-06649751 , compared to patients taking placebo. The 
study included patients with early stage Parkinson’s disease who had motor 
symptoms.  To be elig ible to join the study, patients must not have used a dopamine 
medicine for longer than 28 days, or within 7 days of beginning the study.
Patients in this study were assigned to receive either PF-06649751 or placebo.  The 
patients and researchers did not k now who took PF-06649751 and who took the 
placebo.  This is known as a “blinded” study.  Patients were assigned to each 
treatment group by chance alone.  This is known as a “randomized” study.  Putting 
people into groups by chance helps make the groups more similar so they can be 
compared.

3First, patients were checked by a study doctor to mak e sure they met the requirements 
to join the study.  This was called the screening period, which lasted 30 days.
During the treatment period, which lasted 15 weeks, patients received either 
PF-06649751 or placebo.  The treatment period included 2 parts:
9-week “dose optimization period”.  During this part of the study, the dose was 
gradually increased each week, as tolerated by the patient.  The target dose was 
3 to 15 milligrams of PF-06649751 or matching placebo, taken each day. 
6-week “maintenance perio d”.  During this part of the study, patients were to 
receive the target dose of PF-06649751 or matching placebo each day.
During the treatment period, patients hadstudy appointment visits to be checked by 
study doctors to determine if motor symptoms were improving.  Patients were also 
asked about any medical problems they were having.
Finally, patients came to 2 follow -up visits after their last dose of PF-06649751 or 
placebo, at week 17 and week 19.
This study ended early in January 2018, because another study that was being done 
with PF-06649751 did not show benefit for patients with Parkinson’s disease.  So, the 
sponsor decided to stop this study, as well.  However, patients who were already 
enrolled in the study were allowed to complete it.
The figure o n the following page shows what happened during this study.

4Patients were in this study for up to 23 weeks, but the entire study took more than 
15months to complete.  The sponsor ran this study at 23 locations in Germany, 
France, Israel, and the United States.  It began 17 October 2016 and ended 29 January 
2018.  34 men (60%) and 23 women (40%) joined the study and received study 
treatment.  All patients were between the ages of 45 and 79 years.
Patients were to complete the 15 -week treatment period andthen enter a 28 -day 
follow -up period.  Of the 57 patients who started the study and received study 
treatment, 54 patients (95%) completed the follow -up period.  However, a total of 
10out of 57 patients (18%) stopped taking study treatment early by their choice or 
because they had a medical problem.

5When the study ended early in January 2018, the Sponsor began reviewing the 
information collected.  The Sponsor then created a report of the results.  This is a 
summary of that report.
