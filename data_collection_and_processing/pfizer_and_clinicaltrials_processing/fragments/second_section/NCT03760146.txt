This study included 3 different age ranges of participants to learn about the safety and 
about the antibody response to 20vPnC . The main age range studied was participants 
60 years old and above.  The vaccines used in this study included 20vPnC, 13vPnC, 
PPSV23, and salt water (saline) placebo.  A placebo is given in the same way as the 
vaccines used in study but does n ot have active ingredients.  20vPnC and 13vPnC 
looked the same; however, the saline and PPSV23 looked different and were injected 
by staff that were not involved in other aspects of the study. Participants were asked 
to turn their heads when the PPSV23 or saline was injected so they would not know 
which one they had received.  
Participants were checked (screened) to make sure they were a good fit for the study.  
This study included adult men and women who:
Were at least 18 years old
Were considered to be healthy or with stable chronic disease by the study 
doctors

4Did not have a disease or take medicine that would be associated with a 
weakened immune system
Never received any vaccine for S.pneumoniae
Never had a disease caused by S.pneumoniae
Never had a severe medical problem caused by a vaccine or an allergic reaction 
to any of the components in the vaccines used in this study
Participants of 3 different age ranges were entered into the study.
60 years of age and older ( 3009 participants)
50 through 59 y ears of age (445 participants)
18 through 49 years of age (44 8participants)
Next, participants in the 3 age ranges were assigned to vaccine groups by chance 
alone, and received the following vaccinations :
60 years and older :  
Vaccine Group 1: 20vPnC at Visit 1 and placebo at Visit 2 one month later 
(1507participants)
Vaccine Group 2: 13vPnC at Visit 1 and PPSV23 at Visit 2 one month later 
(1490participants )
50 through 59 years of age:
Vaccine Group 1: 20vPnC at Visit 1 (33 4participants)
Vaccine Group 2: 13vPnC at Visit 1 (111 participants)
18 through 49 years of age: 
Vaccine Group 1: 20vPnC at Visit 1 (335 participants)
Vaccine Group 2: 13vPnC at Visit 1 (112 participants)
This was a “randomized” study, which means that participants were assigne d to 
groups based on chance alone.  Randomization is done to make the groups similar so 
that differences in antibody response or safety are most likely due to the different 
vaccines p articipants received.

5This study was also “double -blinded”.  This means that participants and study staff 
members who administered the vaccine did not know who was given which vaccine.  
This was done to make sure that the study results were not influenced in any way.
Participants 60 years of age and older were expected to par ticipate in 3 study visits.   
At the first visit, blood samples were collected first and then participants received 
either 20vPnC or 13vPnC.  The second visit was done about 1 month after the first 
visit. Blood samples were collected before the participants received either saline 
placebo or PP SV23, and they were checked for medical problems.  The third visit was 
done about 1 month after the second visit.  Blood samples were collected and 
participants were asked about medical problems.
Participant s 18 to 59 years of age were expected to participate in 2 study visits.  At the 
first visit, blood samples were collected first and then participants received either 
20vPnC or 13vPnC.  The second visit was done about 1 month after the first visit. 
Blood s amples were collected and participants were asked about medical problems.
All participants were also contacted over the phone about 6 months after Visit 1.  The 
participants were asked about medical problems and whether they had received any 
other vaccines besides the study vaccines.

than a year to complete as participants entered the study at different times.  The 
Sponsor ran this study at 61 locations in the United States and Sweden.  It began 
12December 2018 and ended 16 December 2019.  1558 men (40%) and 2331 women 
(60%) received the study vaccines .  All participants were between the ages of 18 and 
91years. 
Of the 3902 participants who joined the study, 3690 (95%) completed it.  A total of 
212 participants (5%) left the study early. The most common reasons for leaving early 
were the participant's choice or because a doctor decided it was best for them to stop 
the study.
Throughout the course of the study, the Sponsor reviewed the data. When the study 
ended in December 2019 and after antibody testing was completed, the Sponsor then 
created a report of the results.  This is a summary of that report .
