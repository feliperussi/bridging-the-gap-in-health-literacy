This study compared 2groups of patients .  Researchers wanted to find out if 
PF-05280014 worked similarly to Herceptin in patients with breast cancer.   
This study included adult women who:

3Had HER2 -positive breast cancer
Had breast cancer that had spread to another part of the body
Had at least 1 breast cancer tumor that could be measured
The patients and researchers di d not know who received PF-05280014 and who 
received Herceptin .  This is known as a “ double -blind ed” study.   Researchers use 
“double -blinded” studies to make sure that the results of the study are not influenced 
in any way.  
First, patients were checked (screened) to make sure they met all the requirements to 
be in the study.  Then, p atients were put into 1 of 2 treatment groups by chance alone .  
This is known as a “randomized” study.  This is done to make the groups more 
similar for things like age and r ace.  Reducing differences between the groups makes 
the groups more even to compare.  Patients had a 50% chance (1 in 2 chances, like 
the flip of a coin) of getting either treatment.
For at least the first 33 weeks of the study, patients were treated with PF-05280014 or 
Herceptin every week.  Depending on how the patient was doing, t he treatments were
given in at least 6 “cycles”, with a new cycle starting every 4weeks.  Paclit axelwas 
given weekly for the first 3 weeks of each cycle.  After 33 weeks and t reatment with 
paclitaxel hadstopped, depending on how the patient was doing, the study doctor 
could change the PF -05280014 or Herceptin treatment schedule to every 3 weeks.   
After completing study treatment, p atients were followed by researchers to see ho w 
they did after taking study medicines .
Patients were expected to receive study treatment until their breast cancer worsened.  
The entire study took more than 6 years to complete.  The Sponsor ran this study at 
168locations in 25countries in North America, South America, Europe, and Asia .  It 
began 2 4February 2014 and ended 27 June 2020 .  All patients were women between 
the ages of 19 and 85 years .

4Thefigure below shows what ha ppened in the study.
A total of 707 patients joined the study, but 5 patients (1%) did not receive any study 
treatment. 451patients (64%) finished the study .  251patients (35%) left before the 
study was over by their choice , because a doctor decided it was best for a patient to 
stop the study , because they passed away, or because the Sponsor stopped the study .
When the study ended inJune 2020 , the Sponsor began reviewing the information 
collected.  The Sponsor then created a report of the results.  This is a summar y of that 
report .
