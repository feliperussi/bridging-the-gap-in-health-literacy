This study compared 2 groups of patients taking either PF-06439535 plus paclitaxel 
and carboplatin or Avastin plus paclitaxel and carboplatin , to determine if 
PF-06439535 works in a similar way to Avastin .The study included adult patients 
with either newly diagnosed or recurring NSCLC .  For patients with recurring 
NSCLC, the last systemic treatment (a treatment that affects the whole body) should 
have been received at least 6 months ago.   The patients and researchers did not know 
who took which medicines .  This is known as a “blin ded” stu dy.  
Patients were screened by the study doctor to make sure they were a good fit to join 
the study.  This was known as the “screening pe riod”, which lasted up to 28 days.  
Next, patients were assigned to receive either PF-06439535 plus paclitaxel and

3carboplatin or Avastin plus paclitaxel and carboplatin.  Patients were assigned to each 
group by chance alone.  Putting people into groups by chance helps to make the 
groups more even to compare.
The medicines were given by IV infusion (a needle into the vein).   During the first 
part of this study, patients received 4 to 6 infusions of either PF-06439535 plus 
paclitaxel and carboplatin or Avastin plus paclitaxel and carboplatin .  The infusions 
were given once every 21 days.   
During the second part of this study, paclitaxel and carboplatin were stopped, and the 
infusions included only PF-06439535 or Avastin .  This lasted until the end of the 
study.   Finally, there was a follow -up period, which lasted for 28 days after the 
patients finished taking study treatment.
The figure below shows what happened during this study.
Patients were considered to have completed the study at 1 year, although some 
patients were in the study longer than 1 year.   The entire study took more than 
2½years to complete.  The sponsor ran this study at 216locations in Africa, Asia,

4Australia, Europe, North America, and South America (however, no patients joined 
the study at 57 of these locations ).  It began 20 April 2015 and ended 
22December 2017.  467men (65%)and 252women (35%) participated.  All patients 
were between the ages of 25 and 87 . 
Patients were to be treated for 1 year and complete the 28 day follow -up period . A 
total of 719 patients joined the study, but only 714 received study treat ment.  Of the se 
714 patients ,380(53%) finished the study .  There were 334 patients who left before
the study was over by their choice or a doctor decided it was best for a patient to stop 
the study , or because they passed away .
When the study ended in December 2017 , the Sponsor began reviewing the 
infor mation collected.  The Sponsor then cr eated a report of the results. This is a 
summary of that report.
