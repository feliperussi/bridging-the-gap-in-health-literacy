How was the study done?
This study was an open -label study, which means that participants and doctors knew 
what medicines were given to participants. This study was done in 2 parts .
Part 1 
The purpose of P art 1 was to find the recommended dose of binimetinib to study in 
Part 2.  During Part 1, participants were assigned to 1 of 2 treatment groups, 
Group 1A and Group 1B.  Group 1A participants received the following treatments: 
Binimetinib 45 milligram s(mg) twice daily by mouth for 4 weeks; if this dose 
level of binimetinib had DLTs, the following lower dose levels of binimetinib 
were tested in order as follows: 
o45 mg twice daily for 3 weeks then 1 week off 
o30 mg twice daily for 4 weeks 
o30 mg twice d aily for 3 weeks then 1 week off 
Nivolumab 480 mg IV over 30 minutes every 4 weeksResearchers used the results from Group 1A to determine the recommended dose to 
test in Group 1B.  After Group 1A completed study treatment, other participants 
started Grou p 1B.  Group 1B participants received the following treatments:
Binimetinib 45 milligram (mg) twice daily by mouth for 4 weeks; if this dose 
level of binimetinib had DLTs, the following lower dose levels of binimetinib 
were tested in order as follows: 
o45 mg twice daily for 3 weeks then 1 week off 
o30 mg twice daily for 4 weeks 
o30 mg twice daily for 3 weeks then 1 week off 
Nivolumab 480 mg IV over 30 minutes every 4 weeks 
Ipilimumab 1 mg per kilogram (kg) (1 mg/kg) IV over 30 minutes about every 
8 weeks
Participants received study treatments in cycles that lasted 28 days.  Participants were 
to attend visits at the study center on Days 1, 15, and 22 of the first cycle, and on 
Days 1 and 15 of the following cycles.  They were also asked to attend an end of 
treatment visit within 2 weeks of stopping study treatment, and attend follow -up visits 
30 days and 100 days after stopping treatment.  They were then contacted by phone 
150 days after stopping study treatment, and every 12 weeks until the study ended.
Thefigure below shows what happened during Part 1.Part 2
During Part 2 of the study, participants were randomly assigned to 1 of 2 treatment 
groups, Group 2A and Group 2B. Randomly means that participants were assigned 
to the treatment groups by chance, like a flip of a coin.  Participants had an equal 
chance of being in Group 2A or Group 2B. 
Group 2A participants received the following treatments:
Binimetinib at the recommended dose from Part 1, given twice a day by mouth 
for 4 weeks
Nivolumab 480 mg IV over 30 minutes every 4 weeks
Group 2B participants received the following treatments:
Binimetinib at the recommended dose from Part 1, twice a day by mouth for 4 
weeks
Nivolumab 480 mg every 4 weeks IV over 30 minutes on Day 1 of each 
treatment cycle
Ipilimumab 1 mg/kg IV over 30 minutes about every 8 weeks 
Participants received study treatments in cycles that lasted 28 days.  Participants were 
to attend visits at the study center on Days 1, 15, and 22 of the first cycle, and on 
Days 1 and 15 of the following cycles.  They were also asked to attend an end of 
treatment visit within 2 weeks of stopping study treatment, and attend follow -up visits 
30 days and 100 days after stopping t reatment.  They were then contacted by phone 
150 days after stopping study treatment, and every 12 weeks until the study ended .
The figure below shows what happened during Part 2.Where did this study take place? 
The Sponsor ran this study at 22 locatio ns in 5 countries (Belgium, the Netherlands, 
Spain, the United Kingdom, and the United States) .
When did this study take place?
It began 18 October 2017 and ended 25 February 2021 .
Who participated in this study?
The study included participants who:
Were a t least 18 years of age
Had metastatic colorectal cancer that was microsatellite stable
Had RAS mutation
Had received at least 1 but no more than 2 prior systemic treatments 
(treatments that travel through the blood cells to all over the body) for 
colorect al cancer, and were either unable to tolerate the treatment or had 
unsatisfactory results
Had never received certain other treatments for colorectal cancer
A total of 75 participants enrolled in the study and received study treatment.  During 
Part 1, there were 10 participants in Group 1A and 11 participants in Group 1B.  
During Part 2, there were 27 participants in Group 2A and 27 participants in 
Group 2B.
The participants included:
A total of 48 men participated
A total of 27 women participated
53 participants were less than age 65 years old
22 participants were age 65 years old or older
Participants could continue receiving study treatment until their colorectal cancer got 
worse (up to a maximum of 2 years for nivolumab and ipilimumab) .  Of the 
75participants who started the study:
1 (3% )participant who received binimetinib + nivolumab completed the study 
through the follow -up part of the study
5 (13% )participants who received binimetinib + nivolumab + ipilimumab
completed the study through the follow -up part of the study
36 (97%) participants who took binimetinib + nivolumab did not finish the study 
because they:
Passed away: 28 (76%) participants
Withdrew consent: 5 (1 4%) participants
Were lost to follow -up: 3 ( 8%) participants33 (87%) participants who took binimetinib + nivolumab + ipilimumab did not finish 
the study because they:
Passed away: 29 (76%) participants
Withdrew consent: 2 (5%) participants
Were lost to follow -up: 1 (3%) participant
Other reason: 1 (3%) participant
How long did the study last?
The entire study took about 3 years and 4months to complete.
When the study ended in February 2021, the Sponsor began reviewing the 
information collected.  The Sponsor then created a report of the results.  Th is is a 
summary of that report.
