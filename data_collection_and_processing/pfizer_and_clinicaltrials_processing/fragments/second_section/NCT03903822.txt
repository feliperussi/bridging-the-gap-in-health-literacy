This study compared patients using different dose strengths and 2 application 
schedules to find out if patients who were treated with brepocitinib cream were more 
likely to have their AD improve compared to patients treated with a vehicle cream .  
The study included adults and childre n who were diagnosed with mild to moderate 
ADat least 3 months before enrolling in the study.  Study participants must not have 
taken drugs like brepocitinib ( called “TYK2 inhibitors” or “JAK inhibitors ”) in the 
3months before they were screened for the study .
The patients and doctors did not know who used brepocitinib cream and who used 
the vehicle cream.  This is known as a “double -blinded” study.  This is done to make 
sure the results of the research study cannot be unfairly influenced by anyone .  
Patients were assigned to 1 of the 8treatment groups by chance (like the flip of a coin 
or drawing straws).  This is known as a “randomized and vehicle -controlled” study.
While patients were only in the study for up to 16 weeks, the entire study took 
12month s to complete.  The Sponsor ran this study at 70 locations in 10 countries in 
North America, Australia, Europe ,and Japan.  It began on 13 May 2019 and ended on 
07May 2020.  A total of 136 men/boys and 156 women participated.  All patients 
were between th e ages of 13 and 74. 
Patients were to be treated until they completed the study treatment phase, until they 
chose to stop, or until they had certain medical problems .  Of the 292 patients who 
started the study, 240 finished the treatment phase and 245 fin ished the follow -up 
phase of the study.  A total of 52 patients did not finish the treatment phase and 
47patients did not finish the follow -up phase of the study.  A total of 22 patients 
stopped treatment before the study was over by their choice , and 2 p atients stopped 
treatment because a doctor decided it was best for a patient to stop being in the study.

4When the study ended in May 2020 , the Sponsor began reviewing the information 
collected.  The Sponsor then created a report of the results. This is a summary of that 
report.
