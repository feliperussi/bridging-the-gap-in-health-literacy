This study included adult patients with ATTR -PN who had participated in prior 
studies with tafamidis and never had a heart or liver transplant. 
All patients in this study received tafamidis 20 milligrams, taken once per day every 
day by mouth. Patients w ere asked to attend clinic visits every 6 months, and were 
contacted by phone 3 months after each clinic visit .  There was also a follow -up 
contact 30 days after patients stopped taking tafamidis to check for any medical 
problems.  This was an “open -label” study, which means that both the patients and 
researchers knew what medicine was being given.
The figure below shows what happened during this study.

3There was no specific amount of time that patients were required to stay in the study, 
but the time from when the first patient started to when the last patient ended was
about 11 years. The Sponsor ran this study at 9 locations in North America, South 
America, and Europe.  It began 5 August 2009 and ended 8 July 2020. 47 patients 
(51%) were women and 46patients (49%) were men.  All patients were between the 
ages of 26 and 78years old when they started in th isstudy.
Patients could be treated for up to 10 years or until tafamidis became available by 
prescription in their country.  Patients who left the study when they got a prescription 
for tafamidis were called completers. Of the 93 patients who started the study, 
68patients (73%) were completers .  25 patients (27%) left before the study was over 
by their choice or a doctor decided it was best for a patient to stop the study, or 
because they passed away.

4When the study ended in July 2020, the Sponsor began reviewing the information 
collected.  The Sponsor then created a repo rt of the results.  This is a summary of that 
report.
WHAT MEDICAL PROBLEMS DID PATIENTS 
HAVE DURING THE STUDY?
The researchers recorded any medical problems the pa tients had during the study.  
Patients could have had medical problems for reasons not relat ed to the study (for 
example, caused by another illness they have or by chance).  Or, medical problems 
could also have been caused by a study treatment or by another medicine the pa tient
was taking.  Sometimes the cause of a medical problem is unknown.  By comparing 
medical problems across many treatment groups in many studies, doctors try to 
understand what the side effects of an experimental drug might be.
86 out of 93 patients (93%) had at least 1 medical problem, including 35 out of 
38patients (92%) with Val30Met who received tafamidis only in their previous study , 
33 out of 37 patients (89%) with Val30Met who received placebo followed by 
tafamidis in their previous study , and 18 out of 18 patients (100%) without Val30Met 
who received tafamidis in the ir previous study .  
A total of 6 patients (7%) left the study due to medical problems, including 3 patients 
(8%) with Val30Met who received tafamidis in their previous study , 1 patient (3%) 
with Val30Met who received placebo followed by tafamidis in their previous study , 
and 2 patients (11%) without Val30Met who received tafamidis in their previous 
study .  
The most common medical problems are listed below.

WERE THERE ANY SERIOUS MEDICAL 
PROBLEMS?
A medical problem is considered “serious” when it is life -threatening, needs hospital 
care, or causes lasting problems.  
25 out of 93 patients (27%) had at least 1 serious medical problem, including 6 out of 
38 patients (16%) with Val30Met who received ta famidis in their previous study , 9 out 
of 37 patients (24%) with Val30Met who received placebo followed by tafamidis in 
their previous study , and 10 out of 18 patients (56%) without Val30Met who received 
tafamidis in their previous study .
A total of 11 out of 93 patients (12%) died during the study or the follow -up period, 
including 3 patients with Val30Met who received tafamidis in their previous study
(8%), 1 patient with Val30Met who received placebo followed by tafamidis in their 
previous study (3%), an d 7 patients without Val30Met who received tafamidis in their 
previous study (39%).  None of these deaths were considered to be related to 
tafamidis by the study doctors. 
The table below shows the most common serious medical problems.

Overall, the study results suggest that long -term treatment with tafamidis 
20milligrams, taken once per day every day by mouth, was well -tolerated in patients 
with ATTR -PN.  No new safety concerns were identified during this study.
