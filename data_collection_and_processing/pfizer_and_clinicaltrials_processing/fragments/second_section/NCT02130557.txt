How was the study done?
Researchers tested bosutinib on a group of study participants to find out if 
participants taking bosutinib 400 mg reached MMR at 48 weeks compared to 
participants taking imatinib 400 mg.  Participants were assigned to one of the 
following treatment groups:Researchers wanted to know: 
What percentage (%) of participants receiving bosutinib 400 mg 
reached a MMR at 48 weeks compared to participants receiving 
imatinib 400 mg? A major molecular response means that 
BCR -ABL levels were 0.1% or less.

Bosutinib 400 mg, an investigational drug, which means bosutinib was not 
approved for use in this country to treat CML as initial therapy when the study 
started
Imatinib 400 mg
This was an “open -label” study, which means that doctors and participants knew
which treatment participants were receiving.  However, the laboratory that evaluated 
MMR was not aware of which treatment participants received (blinded).  Participants 
were assigned to each treatment group by chance, like a flip of a coin, and had an 
equal chance of assignment to either treatment group. This is called randomization 
and is done to make the groups more similar. 
Study Plan
During this 48 -week treatment period, participants were required to meet with their 
study doctor every 4 weeks for the first 24 weeks, then at 36 weeks, and at 48 weeks 
for an exam (Core Treatment Phase).
If participants responded to treatment, they continued to take their assigned treatment 
for 4 more years (192 weeks) (Extension Phase) after the initial 48 weeks of treat ment. 
Participants met with their study doctor for follow -up visits until they reached 5 years 
of treatment or until the CML got worse.  The participants could continue to receive 
treatment after the study was completed at the discretion of their treating physician.

Where did this study take place? 
The Sponsor ran this study at 146 locations in 26 countries in 6 regions of the world, 
including: Australia, Asia, Europe, Middle East, North America, and South Africa. 
When did this study take place?
This study began 15 July 2014 and ended 17 April 2020 .
Who participated in this study?
Participants in this study had to meet the following inclusion/exclusion criteria: newly 
diagnosed CML; molecular diagnosis of CML positive for BCR -ABL; no previous 
treatment except for hydroxyurea or anagrelide; acceptable liver and kidney function; 
no central nervous system (brain and spinal cord) involvement; and the ability to 
swallow tablets. 
A total of 311 men participated

Participants were to be treated until 5 years after starting the study.  Of the              
536 participants who started the study, 463 participants finished the study.
73 participants (14%; 14 out of 100) did not finish the study because of: 
Participant request: 24 participants (5%; 5 out of 100)
Participant passed away: 28 participants (5%; 5 out of 100)
Lost to follow -up: 13 participants (2%; 2 out of 100)
Missing: 3 participants (1%; 1 out of 100)
Other reason: 3 participants  (1%; 1 out of 100)
Physician request: (2 participants, or less than 1%, did not finish the study 
because their doctor decided it was best for a participant to stop being in the 
study).
Of the 53 3 participants who received treatment, a total of 314 participants          
(59%; 59 out of 100) were still receiving the study drug at the end of the 5 -year study 
period in both groups.
160 (60%; 60 out of 100) participants in the bosutinib group were sti ll receiving 
bosutinib at the end of the study period. 154 (58%; 58 out of 100) participants 
in the imatinib group were still receiving imatinib at the end of the study 
period.  
219 (41%; 41 out of 100) participants discontinued treatment.  The most 
commo n reasons for discontinuing treatment (occurring in ≥5% of 
participants) were:
o100 participants (19%; 19 out of 100) stopped treatment due to a 
medical problem.  67 participants (25%; 25 out of 100) in the bosutinib 
group stopped treatment because of a med ical problem and 
33participants (13%; 13 out of 100) in the imatinib group stopped 
treatment because of a medical problem.
o56 participants (11%; 11 out of 100) stopped treatment because they did 
not respond to treatment as expected (treatment failure).  1 3 participants 
(5%; 5 out of 100) in the bosutinib group and 43 participants (16%;

treatment failure.
How long did the study last?
Study participants were in the study for 5 years.  The enti re study took almost 6 years 
to complete.
The Sponsor began reviewing the information collected in 2016 and the created a 
report of the results.  The study ended in April 2020 and another report was created 
that included longer -term information.  This is a summary of the 2020 report.
