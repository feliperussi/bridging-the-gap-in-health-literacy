This study compared 3groups of patients to find out if more patients taking 
PF-04965842 had their AD improve compared to patients taking a placeb o.  A 
placebo d oes not have any medicine in it, but it looks just likethe study medicine.
The study included adult men and women, and boys and girls who were aged 12 years 
and older.  Patients included in the study:
Had chronic (long -term) ADfor at least 1 year , and had moderate to severe 
AD when they entered the study.
Also h ad one of the following :
oHad been treated up to 6 months earlier for ADwith medici nes 
applied to the skin , and their ADdid not get better;
oWere unable to use medicines on the skin because of a medical 
problem ;
oNeeded to use medicines that reach all parts of the body to control 
their AD (for example, taking medicines by mouth).
The pati ents and docto rs did not know who took PF-04965842 and who took the 
placebo.  This is known as a “ double -blinded” study.  This is done to make sure the 
results of the research study cannot be unfairly influenced by anyone .  Patient s were 
assigned to 1of 3 treatment group sby chance (like the flip of a coin or drawing straws) 
to receive either PF -04965842 at a dose of 100 mg, PF -04965842 at a dose of 200 mg or 
placebo.  Patients had an 80% (4 out of 5) chance of receiving PF -04965842 and a 
20% (1 out of 5) chance of receiving placebo. This is known as a “randomized” study.

4This study used 2 different tests to measure the severity of the patients’ AD at the 
beginning of the study and throughout 12 weeks of treatment.  The first testis called 
the Inv estigators Global Assessment (IGA) scale andmeasures the severity of AD on 
a 5-point scale (0 being the best and 4 being the worst ).  The second testis called the 
Eczema Area and Severity Index ,andmeasures how severe a patient’s AD is based on 
4 different signs , as well as the amount of skin affected by AD. The difference in 
each patient ’s score between the start of t he study and after 12 weeks of treatment 
was used to decide if their AD had improved.
While patients were only in the s tudy for 12 to 16 weeks , the entire study took 15 
months to complete.  The Sponsor ran this study at 69locations in 8countries in 
North America, Europe, and Australia .  It began 07December 2017 and ended 
26March 2019.  A total of 167 women or girls and 220men or boys participated.  All 
patients were between the ages of 12and 84. 
Patients were to be treated until the end of the 12 week treatment period .  Of the 
387patients who started the study, 333finished the study .  25patients did not finish 
the study because of medical problems. 13patients left before the study was over by

stop being in the study.
When the study ended in March 2019 as pla nned , the Sponsor began reviewing the 
information collected.  The Sponsor then created a report of the results. This is a 
summary of that report.
