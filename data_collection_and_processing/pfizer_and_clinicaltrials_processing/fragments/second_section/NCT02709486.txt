This study compared 3groups of patients to find out if patients taking tanezumab 
would have an improvement in osteoarthritis symptoms .  To answer the research 
question, the researchers looked at 3 smaller questions :
Change in amount of pain due to osteo arthritis, from before study treatment to 
week 24of the study.
Change in amount of physical difficulty due to osteo arthritis, from before study 
treatment to week 24of the study.
Change in overall functioning, from before study treatment to week 24of the 
study.

3The study inclu ded adult patients with osteoarthritis in the hip or knee, who did not 
get adequate pain relief from certain other pain medicines, or who were unable or 
unwilling to take certain other pain medicines . 
First, p atients were screened by the study doctor to make sure they were appropriate
to join the study.  This was known as the “ screening pe riod”, which lasted up to 
37days.  During this time, X -rays of the joints were taken, and osteoarthritis pain was 
assessed.
The next part of the study was the “treatment period” , which lasted 24weeks. 
Patients were assigned to 1 of 3 treatment groups in very similar numbers .  Patients 
were assigned to each group by chance alone. Putting people into groups by chance 
helps make the groups more similar so they can be compared.
Study treatments were given as an injection under the skin (subcutaneously) . Patients 
received a total of 3injections during the study, 1 on the first day of the study ,a 
second one at week 8, and a th ird one at week 16 .
The study treatments included:  
Group 1: Tanezumab 2.5 mg 
Group 2: Tanezumab 5 mg 
Group 3: Placebo 
The patients and researchers did not know who took tanezumab and who took the 
placebo (dummy drug) ,since all treatment options looked the same .  This is known as 
a “blinded” study.  
At study visits in the clinic, starting at the screening visit, the patients completed 
questionnaires, like the questionnaires about pain from osteoarthritis, physical 
disability from osteoarthritis, and overall well -being that were used to answer the 
research question. They also let the staff know about illnesses and discomforts, and 
had assessments (like physical exam, blood pressure, and more) done by the study 
doctors and other qualified personnel.

4Finally , there was a follow -up period, which lasted 24 weeks.  During this time, the 
study doctors monitored the patients for any medical problems.  Patients did not 
receive study treatments during the follow -up period.  Thefigure below shows what 
happened during this study.
While patients were only in the study for about 4 8weeks , the entire study took about
2 ½ years to complete.  The Sponsor ran this study at 104locations in Europe and 
Japan .  It began 2 March 2016 and ended 14 November 2018.  262men (31%)and 
587women (69%) participated.  All patients were between the ages of 26and 8 9. 
Patients were to be treated for 24weeks . Patients were then to complete the 24 -week
follow -up period , during which time they did not receive study treatments . A total of 
849patient s joined the study and received study treatment.  Of the se patients ,726
(85.5%) finished the study .  There were 1 23patients (14.5%)who left before the 
study was over by their choice or a doct or decided it was best for a patient to stop the 
study.

5When the study ended in November 2018, the Sponsor began reviewing the 
infor mation collected.  The Sponsor then cr eated a report of the results. This is a 
summary of that report.
