This study compared 2groups of participants to learn more abou t the long -term 
effects of MenACWY -TT. 
The sponsor asked participants who participated in aprevious stud yon Nimenrix to 
join this study .All the participants were healthy and had received vaccination with 
Nimenrix or Mencevax during the previous stud y.
The participants were placed in 2groups (the same groups as the previous study):
Group 1: Participants who received N imenrix in the previous study (235 
participants )
Group 2: Participants who received Men cevax in the previous study (76 
participants )
The participants were asked to come to up to 5 visits, each a year apart, at the study 
center.  This was known as the “persistence phase” of the study.  During these visits, 
the researchers collected blood samples from the participants .  The researchers looked 
for antibodies in the blood against the 4 different types of meningococcus germ.   
164 p articipants from the Nimenrix group and 56 participants from the Mencevax 
group received a booster dose of Nimenrix at study visit 5. This was known as the 
“booster phase” of the study.
This was an “open label” study, which means that the participants and th e researchers 
knew which vaccine the participants received.
