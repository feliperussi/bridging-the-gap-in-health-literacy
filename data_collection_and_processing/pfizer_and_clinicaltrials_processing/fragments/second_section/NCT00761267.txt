This study was for children who were diagnosed with invasive Candida infection , or 
who were at high risk for getting an invasive Candida infection. The children in this 
study were at least 1 month old , but younger than 18years oldwhen the study started .  
First, the children were checked by the study doctor to make sure they were a good fit 
for the stu dy.  This was called “screening”.

3The children were grouped by age:
Group 1 (19 children) : At least 1 month old , but younger than 2 years old 
Group 2 (19 children) : At least 2 years old, but younger than 5 years old
Group 3 (30 ch ildren) : At least 5 years old, but younger than 18 years old
All the children in this study were given anidulafungin by IV (a needle in the vein), 
and the doses were based on each child’s weight.  On the first day of treatment, 
children were given 3 milligrams (mg) of anidulafungin per kilogram (kg) of weight.  
From the second day of treatment onwards , children were giv en 1.5 mg of 
anidulafungin per kg of weight.  Children were supposed to receive anidulafungin for 
at least 10 days if they had a Candida infection and at least 5 days if they were at high 
risk of getting a Candida infection .
After the anidulafungin treat ment, the study doctor may have decided to switch s ome 
of the children to another antifungal medicine called fluconazole, given by mouth , to 
continue treatment of the Candida infection . All children could receive up to 35 days 
of anidulafungin and up to 4 9 days of total treatment (anidulafungin + fluconazole) .  
This was an “open -label” study, which means that the researchers , the children, and 
the children’s parents/caregivers knew which medicines were being given.   
Safety was carefully considered throughout the study.  The study doctors examined 
each child, did blood /urine tests, and watched for any medical problems.   The study 
doctors also followed up with the children for 6 weeks after their last dose of study 
treatment.
The figure on the followi ng page shows what happened during this study.

4While children were only in the study for up to 13weeks (treatment plus follow -up), 
the entire study took about 9 years to complete.  Children joined the study at 1 of 26
locations in 10 countries ( Brazil, Canada, Greece, Italy, Republic of Korea, Russia, 
Spain, Taiwan, United Kingdom, and United States). The first child joined the study 
on27 February 2009 and the last child finished the study on 14 February 2018.   A 
total of 30girls and 38boys joined th e study.   
Patients we re supposed to receive study treatment for up to 35 days and come to 
2follow -up visit s at week 2 and week 6of the study . Of the 68 children who started 
the study, 58 children (85%) completed it.  Ten ( 10)children (15%) did not finish the 
study by their choice or because they passed away.   The study doctors determined that 
none of these deaths were related to the study treatment.
When the study ended in February 20 18, the Sponsor began reviewing the 
information collected.  The Sponsor then created a report of the results. This is a 
summary of that report.
