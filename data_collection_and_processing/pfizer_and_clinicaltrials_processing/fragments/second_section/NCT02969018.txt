3psoriasis.  The patients and researchers did not know who took PF-06700841 and 
who took the placebo.  This is known as a “blinded” study.  Patients were assigned to 
each group by chance alone.  Putting people into groups by chance helps to make the 
groups easier to compare.
First, patients were checked by the study doctor to make sure they were a good fit to 
join the study.  This was known as the “screening period”, which could last up to 
6weeks.
During the first part of the treatment period, which lasted 4 weeks, patients received 
1of 3 possible treatments:
30 mg PF-06700841, taken once per day (“QD”)
60 mg PF -06700841, QD
Placebo, QD
During the second part of the treatment period, which lasted 8 weeks, patients were 
switched to 1 of 4 possible treatments:
10 mg PF-06700841, QD
30 mg PF-06700841, QD
100 mg PF-06700841, taken once per week (“QW”).  These patients also 
received a placebo medicine on the days that they did not take PF -06700841, so 
that the study would stay blinded.
Placebo, QD
The last part of the study was a follow -up period, which lasted for 8 weeks after the 
patients finished taking study treatment.
The figure on the following page shows what happened during this study.

4While patients were only in the study for up to 26 weeks, the entire study took more 
than 15 months to complete, because p atients joined the study at different times.  The 
sponsor ran this study at 34 locations in Canada, Poland, and the United States .  It 
began 01 December 2016 and ended 19 March 2018.  148 men (70%) and 64 women 
(30%) participated.  All patients were betwee n the ages of 18 and 75. 
Patients were to be treated for 12 weeks and complete the 8 -week follow -up period.  
Of the 212 patients who started the study, 164 finished the study.  A total of 
48patients left before the study was over by their choice , because they had a medical 
problem, or because a doctor decided it was best for a patient to stop the study.
When the study ended in March 2018, the Sponsor began reviewing the information 
collected.  The Sponsor then created a report of the results.  This is a summary of that 
report.
