The study included patients who had NSCLC (referred t o as “disease” in this 
summary) that was advanced or has spread to other parts of the body during or after 
earlier treatment and was caused by a defect in a gene called receptor tyrosine kinase 
(C-ROS1).
A total of 129 patients with ALK -negative andROS1 -positive NSCLC joined this 
study and 127 patients were treated with crizotinib.
This was an open -label study, which means that both the patients and researchers 
knew which study drug and dose they received.  The figure below shows what 
happened durin g this study.
Patients in this study took crizotinib 2 times per day in “cycles” that lasted 28 days.  
They began with a dose of 250 mg.  The patients were watched closely for any 
medical problems.

4While patients were only in the study for an average o f 102 weeks, the entire study 
took almost 7 years to complete.  The Sponsor ran this study at 40locations in 
4countries in East Asia (Japan, China, South Korea, and Taiwan).  It began 
25September 2013 and ended 22 January 2020.  Fifty -four (54) men and seventy -
three (73) women participated.  All patients were between the ages of 23 and 80. 
Patients were to be treated until their cancer stopped responding or got worse, until 
they developed unacceptable medical problems, or until they chose to stop treatm ent.  
Of the 127 patients who started the study, all patients stopped the study; 65 patients 
(51%) died.  A total of 18 patients (14%) had stopped the study by their choice or a 
doctor decided it was best for a patient to stop the study.  Forty -four (44) patients 
(35%) were still ongoing in the study when the study was closed and, if they were still 
on treatment, they were moved to either commercial treatment available in their 
country or they enrolled into another study (Study A8081067).  
When the study e nded in January 2020, the Sponsor began reviewing the information 
collected.  The Sponsor then created a report of the results.  This is a summary of that 
report.
