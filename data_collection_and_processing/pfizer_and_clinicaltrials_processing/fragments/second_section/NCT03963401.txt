How was the study done?
Researchers tested PF-06700841 on a group of study participants to find out if study 
participants with PsA taking PF-06700841 (the test medicine) had a higher ACR20 
score than study participants with PsA taking placebo.  A description of how the 
study was done can be seen in Figure 1 below.Researchers wanted to know: 
Did the participants taking PF-06700841 have better effectiveness in 
the treatment of PsA when compared to placebo?
Researchers wanted to determine the American College of Rheumatology 20 
(ACR20) score of participants taking PF-06700841 and compare it to the 
ACR20 score of participants taking placebo after 16weeks of treatment. 
The ACR20 score was used to assess and establish the improvement by 20% 
in tender swollen joints of participants along with a 20% improvement in at 
least three of the following five factors: 
oInflammation in joints. 
oParticipants tr eatment response and progress. 
oDoctors’ observations of participants treatment response and progress.
oDaily pain in joints.
oHow much PsA interferes with the participants daily activities.
Whether PF-06700841 caused any medical problems in 
participants?
Researchers also wanted to learn more about the safety of PF-06700841 .  
They monitored the pa rticipants for any medical problems that happened 
while they were in the study.

Figure 1.  A description of how the study was done.  The ACR20 was 
determined at 16 weeks.
The study participants and researchers did not know who took PF-06700841 and who 
took the placebo.  This is known as a “blinded” study.  Study par ticipants were 
assigned to each group by chance alone.
The study was only slightly affected by the COVID -19 pandemic as the study 
participants had already completed the treatment portion of the study. 
Where did this study take place? 
The Sponsor ran this study at 47 locations in 11 countries in Australia , Asia, and 
Europe.
When did this study take place?
It began 13 June 2019 and ended 15 January 2021.
Who participated in this study?
The study included participants who were between the ages of 18 and 75years old, 
had symptoms of PsA for at least 6 months, and had active PsA despite taking 
anti-inflammatory medications for at least 4 weeks before the start of the study.
A total of 102men participated
A total of 116women participated
All participants were between the ages of 21and 73 years

Participants were to be treated until the ACR20 scores at the Week 16 and Week 52 
study visits were determined .  Of the 218participants who started the study, 
203participants completed the study v isit at Week 16.  Of the 203participants who 
completed the study visit at Week 16, 168participants completed the study visit at 
Week 52.
Fifteen participants did not complete the Week 16 study visit because:
The participants left the study by their own c hoice, and/or
The participants did not experience an improvement in their PsA, and/or
The participants experienced medical problems
After Week 16, an additional 35 participants left before the study was over by their 
choice or a doctor decided it was best for a participant to stop being in the study.
How long did the study last?
Study participants were in the study for about 12months .  The entire study took 
19months to complete.
When the study ended in January 2021 , the Sponsor began reviewing the information 
collected.  The Sponsor then created a report of the results.  This is a summary of that 
report.
