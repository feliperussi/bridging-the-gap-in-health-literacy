This study compared 3 groups of patients taking avelumab with other investigational 
and approved cancer medications to see what DLTs the patients had, and to see if 
their DLBCL improved.
The study included adult patients with relapsed or refractory DLBCL w ho met the 
following conditions:
They had completed at least 2 (but no more than 4) cycles of treatment with 
rituximab and chemotherapy, with or without a stem cell transplant.  If they 
were not eligible to be treated with a stem cell transplant and/or int ensive 
chemotherapy (for example, due to medical problems), they must have 
completed 1 cycle of treatment with rituximab and chemotherapy.
They did not have evidence of cancer in the brain or spinal cord.
They had not received an organ transplant.
They had not been treated before with certain monoclonal antibody 
medications or non -drug anti -cancer therapies.
They had not received any anti -cancer therapy in the 2 weeks before starting 
the study medications.
Patients were put into 1 of the 3 treatment groups by chance alone.  This is known as 
a “randomized” study.  This is done to make the groups more similar and more even 
to compare.  The patients and researchers knew which medications the patients were 
takin g.  This is known as an “open -label” study.   The medications given to each 
treatment group are shown in the table below.  All medications were given through a 
needle into a vein (intravenous) except for azacitidine, which was given by injection 
under the skin (subcutaneous).

5A diagram of the study is shown below.
This study took 3 years to complete.  The Sponsor ran this study at 15 locations in
5countries in Europe, the United States , and Australi a.  It began 16 December 2016 
and ended on 02 December 2 019.  A total of 24 men and 5 women participated.   Ten 
(10) patients were under the age of 65 and 19 patients were 65 years of age or older. 
Patients were to be treated until the patient or their doctor decided it was best for 
them to stop treatment.  Of the29 patients who started the study, no patients finished 
thefirst phase of the study .  The most common reason for patients leaving the study 
wasbecause their DLBCL got worse.  Two (2) patients left before the study was over 
by their choice or a doctor decided it was best for a patient to stop being in the study .

6The study was stopped before the second phase (Phase 3) began . Group A and 
Group B were closed to enrollment in May 2018, due to less than 2 patients in these 
groups having their DLBCL get bet ter.  Enrollment in Group C was closed in 
September 2018 due to lack of new patients enrolling in the study.
When the study ended in December 2019, the Sponsor reviewed the information 
collected.  The Sponsor then created a report of the results.  This is a summary of that 
report.
