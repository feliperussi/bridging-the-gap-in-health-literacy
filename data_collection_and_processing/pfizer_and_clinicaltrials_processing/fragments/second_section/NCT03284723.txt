How was the study done?
Researchers studied a group of participants to learn more about the safety and the 
possible effectiveness of PF-06804103 , and to determine the recommended dose of 
PF-06804103 to study further .  
Participants included in the study :
Were examined by a study doctor and determined to be appropriate to 
participate 
Were adultsMen could join Part 1A of the study; other parts of this study enrolled women 
only
Had breast cancer that was estrogen -receptor or progesterone -receptor positive 
(meaning that hormones stimulate the growth of the tumor); Part 1A also 
enrolled participants with gastric cancer
Had cancer that was HER2 -positive or HER2 -lowassessed by a diagnostic test
Had cancer that either did not adequately improve with standard treatments, 
returned after initially improving with standard treatments, or for which no 
standard treatments were available
Had cancer that was considered to be advanced (unlikely to be cured), or that 
had spread to other parts of the body beyond the breast or stomach
Part 1A
This part of the study included men and women with breast cancer or stomach 
cancer.  Participants received increasing doses of PF-06804103 ,starting with 
0.15 milligrams (mg) per kilogram (kg) of body weight every 3 weeks, to help 
determine the recommended dose to study further.  Part 1A participants were 
assigned to “cohorts” (smaller groups) of about 2 to 4 participants.  So, the first 
coho rt received 0.15 mg/kg, the second cohort received 0.5 mg/kg, and so on.  The 
study doctors monitored the participants for DLTs. If participants from a cohort had 
too many DLTs, PF-06804103 doses would not be increased any further.
The chart below shows t he doses that were to be tested in Part 1A.
Cohort/Dose Level PF-06804103 Dose
(mg/kg)* 1 (Starting Dose) 0.15
2 0.5
3 1.2
4 2.0
5 3.0
6 4.0
7 5.0Part 1B
This part of the study included 2 women with breast cancer.  Participants received 
2mg/kgPF-06804103 .  Additionally, participants in Part 1B received 125 mg 
palbociclib by mouth every day for 3 weeks and 2.5 mg letrozole by mouth every day 
for 4 weeks (standard treatments for breast cancer).  
Part 2A
This part of the study included 46 women with breast cancer.  Participants were 
randomly assigned (like the flip of a coin) to receive either PF -06804103 4 mg/kg 
every 3 weeks or PF -06804103 3 mg/kg every 3 weeks.
It was also planned to have a Part 2B, but the study was stopped before any 
participants were treated in that part of the study.
Depending on the part of the study they were in, participants were expected to attend 
visits at the study center as follows:
Treatment Cycle 1: Days 1, 4, 8, 15
Treatment Cycles 2 and 3 : Days, 1, 8, 15
Treatment Cycle 4: Days 1, 4, 8, 15
Treatment Cycles 5 and Later: Days, 1, 8, 15
Participants were also expected to attend an end -of-treatment visit and a 
follow -up visit about 1 month later.
Study participants had the option to receive acetaminophen and d iphenhydramine 
about ½ hour to 2 hours before their PF -06804103, to help prevent possible adverse 
reactions.  This was an open -label study, which means that the participants, 
researchers, and study doctors knew which treatments the participants received.
The figure below shows what happened during the study.Where did this study take place? 
The study was conducted at 36 locations in Australia, Italy, Russia, Spain, South 
Korea, and the United States.
When did this study take place?
It began 01November 2017 and ended 31 August 2021.
Who participated in this study?
A total of 95 participants joined this study: 47 participants in Part 1A, 46 participants 
in Part 2A, and 2 participants in Part 1B.
A total of 77 women (81%) and 18 men (19%) participated
All participants were between the ages of 32 and 77 years 
Participants could be treated as long as they continued to benefit from PF-06804103 , 
or until the study ended.  Of the 95 participants who started the study, 93 (98%) 
entered the follow -up phase of the study and 56 participants (59%) completed the 
follow -up phase of the study. 
A total of 3 7participants ( 39%) did not finish the follow -up phase because :
they w ithdrew from the study : 19 participants (20%)
they were lost to follow -up (could not be contacted by study staff): 
5participants (5%)
they passed away : 5 participants (5%)
the sponsor ended the study: 4 participants (4%)
other reason: 4 participants (4%)
How long did the study last?
The amount of time that participants were in the study varied depending on how they 
responded to study treatment.  The entire study took almost 4 years to complete.  The 
Sponsor decided to end the study in August 2021.  This decision was made for 
business reasons and was not due to any safety concerns about PF-06804103.  T he 
Sponsor began reviewing the information collected and created a report of the results.  
This is a summary of that report.
What medical problems did participants have during 
the study?
The researchers recorded any medical problems the participants had during the study.  
Participants could have had medical problems for reasons not related to the study (for 
example, caused by an underlying disease or by chance).  Or, medical problems could 
also have been caused by the study treatment or by another medicine the participant 
was taking.  Sometimes the cause of a medical problem is unknown.  By comparing medical problems across many treatment groups in many studies, doctors try to 
understand wha t effects a study medication might have on a participant.
All 95 participants (100%) in this study had a medical problem, and 89 participants 
(94%) had a medical problem that was considered to be related to the study treatment.
A total of 39 (41%) participants stopped taking study treatment because of medical 
problems.  The table below shows the most common medical problems —those 
occurring in at least 30% of participants —that happened during the study, some of 
which resulted in participants having to stop treatment.
Below are instructions on how to read Tables 1 and 2. 
Instructions for Understanding Tables 1 and 2. 
The 1stcolumn of Table 1 lists medical problems that were commonly reported 
during the study.  All medical proble ms reported by at least 30% of participants are 
listed.
The 2ndcolumn tells how many of the 95 participants treated with PF-06804103
reported each medical problem.  Next to this number is the percentage of the 
95participants treated with PF-06804103 who reported the medical problem. 
Using these instructions, you can see that 43 (45%) participants reported hair loss.Did study participants have any dose -limiting toxicities (DLTs)?
During Part 1A, 4 out of 47 (9%) participants had DLTs:
1 participant in the PF-06804103 3 mg/kg cohort had joint pain and 
nerve pain
1 participant in the PF -06804103 3 mg/kg cohort had musculoskeletal 
(muscles, bones, and joints) pain 
1 participant in the PF-06804103 4 mg/kg cohort had decreased ability of 
the heart to pump bloodTable 1. Commonly reported medical problems by study participants 
Medical Problem PF-06804103 
(95 Participants)
Hair loss 43 out of 95 participants
(45%)
Feeling tired 39 out of 95 participants
(41%)
Numbness, pain, or weakness in hands or feet 
caused by nerve damage31 out of 95 participants
(33%)
Muscle pain 30 out of 95 participants
(32%)
Constipation 29 out of 95 participants
(31%)
Rash 29 out of 95 participants
(31%)1 participant in the PF-06804103 4 mg/kg coho rt had muscle pain, joint 
pain, and tiredness
Based on these results, the researchers selected 4 mg/kg as the recommended dose to 
study further, with flexibility to reduce to a lower dose (such as 3 mg/kg), if needed.
Did study participants have any serious medical 
problems?
A medical problem is considered “serious” when it is life -threatening, needs hospital 
care, or causes lasting problems.  A total of 38 out of 95 (40%) participants had 
serious medical problems, and 19 (20%) participants had seriou s medical problems 
that were considered to be related to study treatment.  The table below shows the 
most common serious medical problems —those occurring in 2 or more 
participants —that happened during the study.Eight participants (8%) died during this study.  These deaths were due to worsening 
cancer and were not considered to be related to study treatment.
