This study compared 3groups of children to find out if toddlers made immune 
system proteins, called antibodies, after taking bivalent rLP2086 , and how the side 
effects compared to taking HAV plus placebo .A placebo does not have any medicine 
in it, but looks just like the medicine.
Children in both age groups were put into 1 of 3 study groups by chance alone.  This 
is known as a “randomized” study, and is done to reduce differences between the 
study groups.  Reducing dif ferences between groups makes comparing the groups 
more fair.
In 2 of the 3 groups, children received the experi mental vaccine bivalent rLP2086. 
One group received a 60 µg dose of bivalent rLP2086, and the second group received 
a120µg dose. The third group received HAV and a placebo.  About 64% (6 out of 
10) of children received bivalent rLP2086 and 33% (3 of 10) received HAV plus 
placebo. Researchers use da placebo to see if the study medicine is safe and works 
better than not taking anything.
The s tudy included children who were age d12 months to less than 24 months.
This study was done in two stages. In Stage 1 ,your child was followed for about 
18months.  During Stage 1, each child received 3 injections, at one of two differen t
dose levels (60 µg or 120 µg) of inve stigational bivalent rLP2086, or HAV and 
placebo. The injections were given at:
Visit 1 (Day 1)
Visit 4 (Month 2) .Children who were randomized to receive HAV receive da 
placebo (sterile saline) injection at this visit .
Visit 6 (M onth 6)
Only children who were originally randomized to the bivalent rLP2086 group in 
Stage 1 were eligible to be enrolled in Stage 2 of the study.  In Stage 2 ,your child was 
followed for about 2 years.  This stage measured how long the immune response 
lasted after the third vaccination with bivalent rLP2086.

4While patients were only in thethe study for about 18 months , stage 1 of the study 
took 2 years to complete.  Patients joined the study at 1 of 25locations in Australia, 
Czechia, Finland, and Poland.   It began 31 August 2015 and is ongoing .  396 children 
participated.   All children were between the ages of 12 months and 24 months . 
Children were supposed to be treated until all vac cinations had been given . Of the 396
children who started the st udy, 381 completed the study .  15 did not finish the study.

5All 15 children left before the study was over by their parent’s choice or because a 
doctor decided it was best for thechild to stop the study.
In August 2017 ,the Sponsor began reviewing the information collected.  The Sponsor 
then cr eated a report of the results. This is a summary of that report.
