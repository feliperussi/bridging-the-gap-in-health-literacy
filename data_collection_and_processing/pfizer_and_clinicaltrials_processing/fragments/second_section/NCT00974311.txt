This study compared 2 groups of patients to find out how long patients would survive
after receiving enzalutamide ,compared to plac ebo.  A placebo does not have any 
active medicine in it, but looks just like the medicine. The study included patients who 
had prostate cancer that was spreading to other parts of the body, despite receiving 
1or 2 prior chemotherapy regimens, including at least 1 regimen with a chemotherapy 
medicine called docetaxel.  These patients were also receiving treatment to block 
androgens.  
Patients in this study were assigned to receive either enzalutamide or placebo.  The 
patients and researchers did not know who took enzalutamide and who took the 
placebo.  This is known as a “blinded” study.  Patients were assigned to each 
treatment group by chance alone.  This is known as a “randomized” study.  Putting

3people into groups by chance helps make the groups more similar so they can be 
compared. 
First, patients were checked by a study doctor to make sure they met the requirements 
to join the study.  This was called the screening period.
During the treatment period, patients received the following treatments:
Grou p 1: 8 00patients received enzalutamide at a dose of 160 milligrams, taken 
by mouth each day
Group 2: 399patients received placebo, taken by mouth each day
During the treatment period, p atients came to study visits every 4 weeks for the first 
49 weeks, then every 12 weeks thereafter.   At the study visits, imaging tests were done 
and patients were checked by study doctors to determine if p rostate cancer was 
getting worse (known as prostate cancer “progression”) .  Patients were also asked 
about any medical problems they were having.
Patients came to a follow -up visit 30days after their last dose of enzalutamide or 
placebo (after prostate cancer progression ).Next, patients who were receiving 
placebo had the option to enter the “open -label extension” part of the study.   During 
this part of the study, all patients received enzalutamide and were followed -up every 
12 weeks.   “Open -label” means that the patients and researchers knew which 
medicine the patients were taking.
The figure on the following page shows what happened during this study.

4The amount of time that patients were in the study varied , but the entire study took
more than 8 years to complete , including both the main part of the study and the 
open -label extension part of the study .  The spon sor ran this study at 156locations in 
15countries in Africa, Australia, Europe, North America , and South America .It 
began 30September 20 09and ended 02November 2017.  1,199men joined the study 
and received study treatment .  All patients were between the ages of 41and 9 2years . 
Patients were to continue receiving study treatment until it was confirmed that their 
prostate cancer had gotten worse, and they were scheduled to begin taking another 
treatment for prostate cancer .Of the 1,199patients who started the study,
250patients (2 1%) were still receiving study treatment when the main part of the

5study ended in September 201 1.  949patients (7 9%) stopped taking study treatment 
by their choice , because a doctor decided it was best for a patient to stop the study , 
because they had a medical problem, because prostate cancer got worse ,or because 
they passed away .  A total of 109 patients from the enzalutamide group and
50patients from the placebo group entered the open -label extension part of the stu dy.
When the study ended in November 2017 , the Sponsor began reviewing the
infor mation collected.  The Sponsor then cr eated a report of the results. This is a 
summary of that report.
