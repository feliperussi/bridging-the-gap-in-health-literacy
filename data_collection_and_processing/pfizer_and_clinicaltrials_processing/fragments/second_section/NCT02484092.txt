Researchers in t his study initially intended to look at 3 groups of patients treated with
fidanacogene elaparvovec at 1 of 3 dose levels .  This was done to see if patients had 
any medical problems after this treatment and also see if this treatment could prevent 
bleeding episodes.  Fidanacogene elaparvo vecwas given as an intravenous ( IV)
infusion, which means that a needle is placed in the vein and the study drug slowly 
drips into the vein .
A total of 22 patient s were screened, 15 patients received fidanacogene elaparvovec . 
All 15 patients received the lowest dose in the study (5 x 1011vg/kg). No patient 
received the 2 higher dose sof fidanacogene elaparvovec . Results presented here are 
from the lowest dose level.
Patients were treated with 100 IU/kg of their us ual FIX protein product ov er more or 
less 10minutes at Day 0 visit. After this , the patients were treated with fidanacogene 
elaparvovec (5 x 1011vg/kg) for approximately 60 minutes via infusion pump , as 
shown in the figure below .
