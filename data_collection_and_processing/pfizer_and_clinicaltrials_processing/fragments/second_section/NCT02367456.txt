This study included patients who:
Were diagnosed with AML ,or medium to high risk MDS or CMML , and had 
not received treatment for their AML , MDS, or CMML before  
Aged ≥18 years 
Had adequate liver and kidney function
Were appropriate for treatment with az acitidine
Able to walk around, take care of themselves, and be active for more than 50% 
of the day (Phase 1 only)
Were not healthy enough to be treated with intensive chemotherapy (Phase 2 
only)
What happened during Phase 1 of the study?
During Phase 1 of this study , 12 patients received glasdegib in combinatio n with 
azacitidine.  The goal of Phase 1 was to learn more about the safety of glasdegib in 
combination with azac itidine.  The starting dose of glasdegib was 100 mg in pill form, 
once daily by mouth for28 days. The starting dose of azacitidine was75 mg per 
square meter of body surface area , given as injections under the skin .  Patients took 
azacitidine in cycles, which means that it was taken for only the first 7 days of each 
28days.  The patients were monitored for medical problems.
What happened during Phase 2 of the study?
The goal of Phase 2 was to find out how many patients would achieve complete 
remission.  30 patients with MDS or CM ML and 30 patients with AML received 
glasdegib in combinatio n with aza citidine. The starting dose of glasdegib was 100 mg 
in pill form, once daily by mouth for 28 days. The starting dose of azacitidine was 
75mg per square meter of body surface area , given as injections under the skin or into 
the vein .  Patients took azacitidine in cycles, which means that it was taken for only 
the first 7 days of each 28 days.  Patients with MDS or CM ML were monitored for at 
least 28 weeks, and patients with AML were monitored for at least 24 weeks.

4The amount of time that patients were in the study varied depending on their 
response to study treatment , but the entire study took almost 5 years to complete.  
The Sponsor ran this study at 32 locations in 6 countries in North America and 
Europe.  It began 28 April 2015 and ended 29 January 2020.  A total of 5 women 
(42%) and 7 men (58%) participated in Phase 1, and 18 women (30%) and 42 men 
(70%) participated in Phase 2.  All pati ents were between the ages of 55 and 89 . 
Patie nts were t o be treated until their AML, MDS , or CMML stopped responding or 
got worse, until they developed unacceptable medical problems, or until they chose to 
stop treatment or started a new treatment for AML, MDS, or CCML .  Of the 
60patients who starte d Phase 2 of the study, 21 were still in the study at the time of 
this report .  A total of 3 9patients left Phase 2 before the st udy was over by their 
choice, because a doctor decided it was best for a patient to stop being in the study , or 
because the pat ient died .  This included 15 patients (50%) with MDS or CMML and

524 patients (80%) with AML.  Patient death was the most common reason that 
patients left the study early. 
When the study ended in January 2020 , the Sponsor reviewed the information 
collected .  The Sponsor then created a report of the results.  This is a summary of that 
report.
