This study evaluate da group of participant s to learn more about the safety of 
pregabalin.  The study included participant s between the ages of 1 month and 16 years 
who were diagnosed with epilepsy with partial onset seizures, and participants 
between the ages of 5 years and 65 years who were diagnosed with epilepsy with 
PGTC seizures.  Some of these participant s had participat ed in a previous study with 
pregabalin, and all participants were already taking 1 to 3 other treatments for epilepsy 
(antiepileptic drugs to help prevent seizures ) in addition to pregabalin .  Participant s 
continued to take their other antiepileptic drugs during the study.  
This was an “open -label” study, which means that the participants and the researchers 
knew which treatment sand dose sthey received during the study.  Pregabalin was 
divided into 2 or 3 daily doses and taken by mouth, either as tablets or a liquid, for 
approximately 1 year.

3For participants between 1 month and 16 years old, the beginning pregabalin dose 
was based on weight:   
2.5 milligrams (mg) for each kilogram (kg) of body weight per day, for 
participants who weigh 30 kg (66 pounds) or more 
3.5 milligrams for each kilogram of body weight per day, for participants who 
weigh less than 30kg (66 pounds)
For participants 17 years and older, the beginning pregabalin dose was a total of 
150mg per day, divided into 2 dail y doses of 75 mg.
The study doctor may have adjusted the sedoses, as needed, but study participants did 
not receive more than 600 mg of pregabalin per day.
Participants were asked to attend 9 visits at the study center, and were contacted by 
phone at leas t once per month.  Participants (or their parents) were also asked to 
record any seizures in a diary.
The figure on the following page shows what happened during this study.

4The sponsor ran this study at 142locations in 31countries in Asia, Europe, and 
North America .  It began 21 February 2012 and ended 22 August 2019.  A total of 
319(53%)males and 286(47%)females participated.   491 (81%) participants were 
16years or younger, and 114 (19%) participants were 17 years or older.
A total of 76% (462 of 605 ) oftheparticipant s who started the study, finished.  A 
total of 24% (142 of 605 ) of the p articipant s left before the study was over by their 
choice ,a doctor decided it was best that they stop the study , or they passed away for a 
reason not cause d by taking pregabalin .  Additionally, 1 (less than 1%) participant left 
the study safely, but further information could not be reported due to an issue with 
the approval required by local healthcare authorities.
When the study ended in August 2019, the Sponsor reviewed the infor mation 
collected.  The Sponsor then cr eated a report of the results. This is a summary of that 
report.
