This study was done to learn more abou t the use of dalteparin in children who have a 
VTE.   The children who entered the study had to have VTE, and may also have had a 
090177e1906a44c9\Approved\Approved On: 22-Feb-2019 06:22 (GMT)type of cancer.  
First, the children were checked by the study doctor to make sure they were a good fit 
for the study.  This was called “screening”.  
The children were grouped by age:
Group 1 ( 1 child ): 0 weeks old to less than 8 weeks old
Group 2 ( 2children): At least 8 weeks old, but less than 2 years old
Group 3 ( 8children): At least 2 years old, but less than 8 years old
Group 4 ( 7child ren): At least 8years old, but less than 1 2 years old
Group 5 ( 20children): At least 12 years old, but less than 19 years old
This was an “open label” study, which means that the children, their 
parents/guardians, and the study doctors knew which medicine the children received 
during the study. In this study, all children received dalteparin.
There w ere 3 phases to this study.  Phase 1 was known as the “do se adjustment 
phase”.  This phase started when the child received their first (starting) dose of study 
medicine and continued for up to 7 days.  
The starting dose depended on the age and weight of thechild, as follows:
Group 1: 125 IU per kilogram (kg) o f weight  
Group 2: 150 IU per kg of weight  
Group 3: 125 IU per kg of weight  
Group 4 :125 IU per kg of weight  
Group 5 :100 IU per kg of weight  
Then, d uring this 7 -day “dose adjustment phase”, the study doctors tested the child’s 
anti-Xa levels.  Each child’s dalteparin dose was adjusted (upward or downward) ,as 
needed, until the child’s anti -Xa test result was between 0.5 and 1.0 (the “target ”
range).  The dose that put the child ’s anti -Xa level into that target range is called the 
“maintenance dose”. This is the dose that would be used going forward, in order to 
keep the child’s anti -Xa level within the target range. 
Once the children had reached the target anti -Xa level, they entered Phase 2 of the 
090177e1906a44c9\Approved\Approved On: 22-Feb-2019 06:22 (GMT)study.  Phase 2 was known as the “pharmacodynamics phase” , and it lasted between
1and7 days (enough time to collect 2 blood samples from each child).  During this 
time, children received their maintenance dose from Phase 1, given every 12 hours.  
After they completed Phase 2, the children entered Phase 3 of the study.  Phase 3 was 
known as the “follow -up phase” , and it lasted until the end of the study.  The children 
continued receiving their maintenance dose of dalteparin, given every 12 hours. The 
study doctors tested the children’s blood to make sure anti -Xa was still within the
target range (0.5 to 1.0) .  
The figure below shows what happened during this study.
While children were only in the study for up to 90 days , the entire study took a lmost
9years to complete.  The sponsor ran this study at 15 locations in Norway, Russia, 
Slovenia, Spain, and the United States.  It began 20August 2009and finished  
20March 2018.  A total of 14 girls and 24boys participated   All children were 
between the ages of 0and 1 8years old .
The study required the children to come to a total of 7 visits at the study center. Of 
the 38children who were treated in the study, 26children (68%) completed all of the 
090177e1906a44c9\Approved\Approved On: 22-Feb-2019 06:22 (GMT)study visits .  At total of 12children (32%) did not finish the study , either due to 
medical problems or by their parent /guardian ’s choice.   
When the study ended in March 2018, the Sponsor began reviewing the information 
collected .  The Sponsor then created a report of the results. This is a summar y of that 
report.
