This study compared 2 groups of participants to find out what happens to 
dacomitinib in the body of participants who have severe hepatic impairment 
compared to participants with no hepatic impairment.   
The study included adult participants who weighed more than 50 kg (110 lb) with 
severe hepatic impairment or with no hepatic impairment.   
Participants were put into 1 of 2 treatment groups according to how well their liver 
was working.  Participants with severe hepatic impairment joined the study first and 
patients with no hepatic impairment joined afterwards.  The researchers tried to 
match the 2 groups so that the average age and average body weight of each group 
were similar.  This meant the 2 groups were similar except for how well their livers 
were working. 
All participants in the study took dacomitinib.

While participants were only in the study for 8 days (i.e., from the day before 
treatment until 7 days after treatment), the entire study took just over 6 months to 
complete.  The Sponsor ran this study at 2 locations in the US.  It began 
05 April 2019  and ended 24 October 2019.  16 men participated and all were between 
the ages of 52 and 68 years.  
Participants were admitted to the study unit the day before they were treated and had 
to stay overnight and not to eat during this time.  This meant that when they were 
treated with a single dose of 30 mg dacomitinib they had not eaten for more than 
10 hours.  Participants were then asked to stay in the study unit for 7 days.  Blood 
samples were taken during this time and they were asked how they felt.  Of the 
16 patients who started the study, all finished the study. 
When the study ended in October 2019, the Sponsor began reviewing the information 
collected.  The Sponsor then created a report of the results.  This is a summary of that 
report.
