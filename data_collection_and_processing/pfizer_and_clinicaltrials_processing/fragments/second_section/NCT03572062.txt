How was the study done?
Researchers studied RSVpreF in healthy older adults to find out if participants had 
any health problems when given RSVpreF . This study was organized into 2 different 
cohorts, Cohort 1 and Cohort 2. Cohort is just another word for a group of people in 
a clinical study.
Participants in Cohort 1 also received a flu vaccine at the same time as RSVpreF.  
These participants were a ssigned to 1 of 8 treatment groups by chance alone :

Group 1: Low dose ( 60micrograms (μg))RSVpreF with aluminum hydroxide 
(32participants)
Group 2: Low dose ( 60 μg) RSVpreF with CpG and aluminum hydroxide 
(32participants)
Group 3: Medium dose ( 120 μg) RSVpreF with aluminum hydroxide  
(32participants)
Group 4: Medium dose ( 120 μg) RSVpreF with CpG and aluminum hydroxide 
(31participants)
Group 5: High dose ( 240 μg) RSVpreF with aluminum hydroxide 
(32participants)
Group 6: High dose ( 240 μg) RSVpreF wit h CpG and aluminum hydroxide 
(32participants)
Group 7: High dose ( 240 μg) RSVpreF with no aluminum hydroxide or CpG 
and aluminum hydroxide (32 participants)
Group 8: Placebo (An injection that does not have any vaccine in it, but it 
looks just like RSVpre F)(31 participants)
The first 4 participants were watched by study staff for at least 4 hours after their 
vaccination to monitor for any medical problems, and vaccination for the rest of the 
participants could begin no sooner than 2 days later. Vaccinatio n was also limited to 
no more than 6 participants per day for the first week of the study, and participants 
were followed up for 1 year after their first vaccination.

Participants in Cohort 2 did not receive a flu vaccine during this study.  These 
participants were assigned to 1 of 2 treatment groups by chance alone .  At Visit 1, the 
participants received either:
Group 1: High dose ( 240 μg) RSVpreF with CpG and aluminum hydroxide 
(32participants)
Group 2: Placebo (31participants)
The participants then received a second dose of either RSVpreF or placebo 2 months 
later.
  
The researchers and participants from Cohort 1 and Cohort 2 did not know which 
vaccine they received. This is known as a “double -blind” study. 
Participants were expected to participate in 6 study visits over the course of 1 year. At 
the visits, blood samp les were collected, vaccines were given, and participants were 
checked for any medical problems.

Where did this study take place?
The Sponsor ran this study at 12 locations in Australia.
When did this study take place?
It began 05 June 2018 and ended 20 August 2020.
Who participated in this study?
Participants were checked (screened) by the study doctors to make sure they were a 
good fit for the study. 
This study included participants who:
Were 65 to 85 years old
Were males, or females not of childbearin g potential (able to have children)
Were considered to be healthy or with stable chronic disease by the study 
doctors
Did not have a disease or take medicine that would be associated with a 
weakened immune system
Had never received any vaccine for RSV 
Had not received a flu vaccine within the past 6 months (Cohort 1 only)
Had never had a severe medical problem or allergic reaction to any of the 
vaccine ingredients
Were informed of the risks and benefits of this study and agreed to participate
254 participa nts joined Cohort 1.  Of these, 250 (98%) participants were vaccinated 
and 247 (97%) participants completed the study. Two participants (1%) from Cohort 
1 left the study early by their own choice, and 1 participant (less than 1%) passed away 
for a reason t hat was not related to study vaccination. 
63 participants joined Cohort 2 and received the first vaccination. 57 (91%) 
participants received the second vaccination. 56 participants were withdrawn from 
Cohort 2 when the Sponsor decided to end the study early. Additionally,:
4 (6%) participants left the study early due to a medical problem
1 (2%) participant left the study early by their own choice

1 (2%) participant left the study early because they no longer met the study 
requirements
1 (2%) participant left the study early due to study doctor decision
In the overall group of participants:
A total of 145 women were vaccinated
A total of 168 men were vaccinated
All participants were between the ages of 65 and 85 years at the start of the 
study
How long d id the study last?
Participants were in the study for about 1 year. The entire study took almost 2 years to 
complete.
Cohort 1 was completed as planned. Cohort 2 ended early, 6 months after each 
participant had received their second vaccination. The Sponsor decided to end the 
study early because immune responses were not found to be different in the 
participants who received RSVpreF with CpG, compared to other RSVpreF 
formulations . This decision was not made due to any safety concerns. When the st udy 
ended in August 2020, the Sponsor began reviewing the information collected. The 
Sponsor then created a report of the results. This is a summary of that report.
