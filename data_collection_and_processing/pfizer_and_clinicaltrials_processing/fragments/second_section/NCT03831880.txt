This study compared the “treatment burden” (interference in child’s life) of a weekly 
treatment schedule with somatrogon, compare d to a daily treatment schedule with 
Genotropin.  The study included children between the ages of 3 and 18 years.  All 
children in the study had been diagnosed with growth hormone deficiency, had low 
levels of growth hormone, and were currently receiving d aily treatment with 
Genotropin for at least 3 months.
Children were evaluated by the study doctor to make sure they met the criteria to 
participate in the study.  This was known as the “screening period”, which lasted up 
to 30 days.  Next, eligible childre n were assigned to 1 of 2 treatment groups:

3Group A (43 children): 12 weeks of daily treatment with Genotropin, followed 
by 12 weeks of weekly treatment with somatrogon
Group B (44 children): 12 weeks of weekly treatment with somatrogon, 
followed by 12 wee ks of daily treatment with Genotropin
Children were assigned to each group by chance.  Putting people into groups by 
chance is called randomization.  This helps make it more likely that the groups will be 
more even to compare. 
The children, their parents, and the study doctors knew who took somatrogon and 
who took Genotropin during the study.  This is known as an “open -label” study.  
Study treatments were given at home as injections with a small needle under the skin .  
Children were expected to participat e in 7 study visits (over the phone or in person).  
At the beginning of the study and after each 12 -week treatment period, the children 
and their parents/caregivers were asked to complete a questionnaire about the 
treatment burden of Genotropin or somatrog on.  A follow -up phone visit was done 
4weeks after the last clinic visit.
The figure below shows what happened during this study.
Children were to be treated for 24 weeks.  The entire study took about 1 ½ years to 
complete.  The sponsor ran this study at 29 locations in 5 countries in Europe and the 
United States.  It began on 7 February 2019 and ended on 28 August 2020.  72 boys 
(83%) and 15 girls (17%) joined the study.  Children who joined the study were 3 to 
17 years old.

4Of the 87 children who started the study and received study treatment, 85 children 
(98%) completed the main part of the study.  2 children (2%) did not complete the 
study because of a medical problem or because they no longer met the requirements 
to parti cipate in the study.  
In August 2020, the Sponsor began reviewing the information collected.  The Sponsor 
then created a report of the results.  This is a summary of that report.
