This study evaluate d3groups of participant s to find out which study drug may be
better for treating PGTC seizures: 
Pregabalin 5 mg/kg/day , or 5 milligrams for each kilogram of body weight per 
day, to a maximum of300mgper day
Pregabalin 10 mg/kg/day , or 10 milligrams fo r each kilogram of body weight
per day , to a maximum of 600mgper day
Placebo
The study included participant s between the ages of 5 and 65 years who were 
diagnosed with epilepsy with PGTC seizures.  All of these participant s were already

3taking 1 to 3 other treatments for epilepsy (antiepileptic drugs to help prevent 
seizures ) in addition to Pregabalin or placebo.  Participant s continued to take their 
other antiepileptic drugs during the study.  
In this summary, results will be described by whether the participant was taking 
Pregabalin or placebo, although participant s were also taking other antiepileptic drugs.  
Participant s were assigned to each group by chance alone (like the flip of a coin) .  This 
is known as a “randomized” study.  This is done to make the groups more similar, 
which makes comparing the groups more fair.
The participant s and researchers did not know who took Pregabalin and who took 
placebo.  This is known as a “blinded” study.  This was done to make sure the results 
of the study could not be unfairly influenced by anyone. In case of urgent need, the 
study team could learn quickly which study drug the participant swere receiving.
The sponsor ran this study at 70locations in 21countries that included: Austria, 
Belarus, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, China, France, Greece, Hungary, India, 
South Korea, Malaysia, Montenegro, Poland, Romania, Russian Federation, Serbia, 
Slovakia, Turkey, Ukraine, United Kingdom, and United States .  It began

4Participant s were in the study for a total of 21 weeks.  In the first 8 weeks of the study 
(baseline), participant s had tests and filled out forms to see if they qualified for the 
study.  Participant s were then to be treated for 13 weeks and then had the option to 
continue in the open -label study (the participant s and researchers know who is taking 
which study drug) , which is a separate study and not discussed in this report . 
A total of 85% (187 of 219) of theparticipant s who started the study finished the 
study .  A total of 15% (32 of 2019) of the p articipant s did not finish the study because
they left before the study was over by their choice ,a doctor decided it was best that 
they stop the study , and1 participant who received placebo died due to epilepsy .
When the stud y ended in February 2019, the Sponsor reviewed the infor mation 
collected.  The Sponsor then cr eated a report of the results. This is a summary of that 
report.
