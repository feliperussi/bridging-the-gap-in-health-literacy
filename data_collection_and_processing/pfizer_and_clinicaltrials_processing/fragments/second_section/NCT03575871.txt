This study compared 3 groups of patients to find out if patients taking abrocitinib had 
their AD improved compared to patients taking placebo.  A placebo does not have 
any medicine in it, but looks just like the medicine.

3The study included adult men and women, and adolescents who were aged 12 years 
and older.  Patients included in the study:
Had chronic (long -term) AD for at least 1 year, and had moderate to severe 
AD when they entered the study.
Also had one of the followin g: 
oHad been treated up to 6 months earlier for AD with medicines 
applied to the skin, and their AD did not get better;
oWere unable to use medicines on the skin because of a medical 
problem;
oNeeded to use medicines that reach all parts of the body to contr ol 
their AD (for example, taking medicines by mouth).
The patients and researchers did not know who took abrocitinib and who took the 
placebo.  This is known as a “double -blinded” study.  This is done to make sure the 
results of the research study cannot b e unfairly influenced by anyone .  Patients were 
assigned to 1 of 3 treatment groups by chance alone (like the flip of a coin or drawing 
straws) to receive either abrocitinib at a dose of 100 mg, abrocitinib at a dose of 200 mg, 
or placebo.  Patients had an 80% (4 out of 5) chance of receiving abrocitinib and a 
20% (1 out of 5) chance of receiving placebo.   This is known as a “randomized” study.

4This study used 2 different tests to measure the severity of the patients’ AD at the 
beginning of the study an d throughout 12 weeks of treatment.  The first test is called 
the Investigators Global Assessment scale and measures the severity of AD on a 
5-point scale (0 being the best and 4 being the worst).  The second test is called the 
Eczema Area and Severity Ind ex, and measures how severe a patient’s AD is based on 
4different signs, as well as the amount of skin affected by AD.  The difference in 
each patient’s score between the start of the study and after 12 weeks of treatment 
was used to decide if their AD ha d improved.
While patients were only in the study for 12 weeks, the entire study took 14 months to 
complete.  The sponsor ran this study at 106 locations in 13 countries in the United 
States, Poland, Republic of Korea, Japan, Australia, Bulgaria, Canada, Germany, 
United Kingdom, China, Latvia, Hungary, and Czech Republic .  It began 
29June 2018 and ended 13 August 2019.  A total of 229 men or boys and 162 women 
or girls participated.  All patients were 12 years of age or older.  The average age of 
patients in this study was 31 years.  Approximately 10% of the patients were between 
the older than 12 and younger than 18 years of age.

5Patients were to be treated until the end of the 12 -week treatment period.  Of the 
391patients who started the study, 52 out of 78 patients (67%) that received placebo 
finished the study, 137 out of 158 patients (87%) that received 100 mg abrocitinib 
finished the study, and 141 out of 155 patients (91%) that received 200 mg abrocitinib 
finished the study.  Some patients did not finish the study because 26out of 
78patients (33%) on placebo, 21 out of 158 patients (13%) on 100 mg abrocitinib, 
and 14 out of 155 patients (9%) on 200 mg abrocitinib left before the study was over 
by their choice or a doctor decided it was best for a patient to stop the study.
When the study ended in August 2019, the Sponsor began reviewing the information 
collected.  The sponsor then created a report of the results.  This is a summary of that 
report.
