This study compared 2 groups of children to learn more about the safety and 
effectiveness of CAZ -AVI when given together with metronidazole , compared to 
another antib iotic medicine called meropenem .  Meropenem is commonly used to 
treat complicated IAIin children.

3This study was for children who were diagnosed with complicated IAI.The children 
in this study were at least 3month sold, but younger than 18years oldwhen the y 
started the study .  
First, the children were checked by the study doctor to make sure they were a good fit 
for the stu dy.  This was called “screening”.  
The children were grouped by age:
Group 1 (30children) : At least 12 years old, but younger than 18years old 
Group 2 (43children) : At least 6years old, but younger than 12years old
Group 3 (9children) : At least 2years old, but younger than 6years old
Group 4 ( 1child): At least 3 months old, but younger than 2 years old
The children were assigned to join 1 of 2 treatment groups.  Children in the first 
treatment group receive dCAZ -AVI plus another antibiotic called metronidazole.  
Children in the second treatment group received an antibiotic called meropenem.   
These medicines were given into a vein with a small tube , and the doses w ere based 
on each child’s weight.  The children were picked to receive either treatment by 
chance alone.  
Children receive deither CAZ -AVI plus metronidazole or meropenem for at least 
3days.  Depending on what the study doctor thought was best for each child, after 
3days of either CAZ -AVI plus metronidazole or meropenem given into a vein, some 
children may have switched to an antibiotic medicine you can take by mouth .  Some 
children could have receiv edeither CAZ -AVI plus metronidazole or meropenem for
up to 15 days.
This was a “ single -blind ” study, which means that the children , their study doctor, 
pharmacist, parents/caregivers , and most of the researchers knew which medicine
they received . However, onestudy doctor who examined the children did not know 
which medicine they were given.
Safety was carefully monitored throughout the study.  The study doctors examined 
each child , did blood or urine tests, and watched for any medical problems.   The study 
doctors also followed up with the children for 27 to 50 days after they started study 
treatment.

4While children were only in the study for up to 50days (treatment plus follow -up), the 
entire study took almost 2years to complete.  Children joine d the study at 1 of
29locations in 10countries ( Czech Republic, Greece, Hungary, Poland, Romania, 
Russian Federation, Spain, Taiwan, Turkey, and United States). The first child joined 
the study on 01August 2015,and the last child finished the study on 01June  2017.  
A total of 30girls and 53boys joined the study.  
Children could receive study treatment for a total of 7 to 1 5days,and come to a visit 
8to 15 days after the last day they got the study treatment.  The children could come 
to a follow -up visit 27 to 50 days after the first day they got the study treatment .In 
total, 83children started the study and81children (98%) completed it , including 
coming back for the last visit .  There were 2 children (2%) who did not finish the 
study b ecause of parent/guardian choice ,or because a doctor decided it was best for 
the child not to continue in the study .  
The figure below shows what happened during this study.
When the study ended in June 2017, the Sponsor reviewed the information collected.  
The Sponsor then created a report of the results. This is a summary of that report.
