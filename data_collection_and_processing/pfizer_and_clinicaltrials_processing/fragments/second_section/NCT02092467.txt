How was the study done?
Participants were checked (screened) to make sure they were a good fit for the study. 
Participants who were a good fit were assigned by chance to receive either:
tofacitinib 5 milligrams (mg) twice per day by mouth,
tofacitinib 10 mg twice per day by mouth (these participants were later 
switched to tofacitinib 5 mg twice per day, due to new safety information 
about tofacitinib), 
or a TNF inhibitor (participants in the United States, Puerto Rico, and Canada 
received adalimumab 40 mg every other week by injection under the skin, 
participants in other countries received etanercept 50 mg once per week by 
injection under the skin) 
This was an “open -label” study, which means that the participants and doctors knew 
which treatment and dose the participants received.  
Participants were expected to attend visits at the study center for the baseline visit, at 
Month 2, Month 3, then every 3 months thereafter, and to complete an end -of-study 
visit, and an end -of study visit at least 28 days later.

benefit from it, or until the study ended.  Of the 4,362 participants who started the 
study and received tre atment, 3,111 completed it.  
A total of 1,615 participants stopped taking study treatment early
by their choice, 
because they did not see significant improvement in RA symptoms, 
because they had a medical problem, or
because a doctor decided it was best for them to stop the study
How long did the study last?
The amount of time that each participant was in this study varied.  The entire study 
took more than 6 years to complete.
When the study ended in July 2020, the Sponsor began reviewing the information
