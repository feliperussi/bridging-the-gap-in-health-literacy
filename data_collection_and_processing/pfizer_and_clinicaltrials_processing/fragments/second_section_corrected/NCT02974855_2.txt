This study included 4 groups of patients given an injection of marstacimab at different doses. This was done to see if patients had any medical problems after this treatment and also see if this treatment could prevent bleeding episodes. The 4 groups and the different doses of marstacimab that were given in this study are shown in the following table. 

Description of Treatment Groups

Group Marstacimab Dose Given Number of Patients Treated per Group 

1. 300 mg injection given once a week for 5 weeks (Day 1 to Day 29) and then continued for another 7 weeks (Day 36 to Day 78). 7
If after 4 weeks the treatment in Group 1 went well then patients in Group 2 could be treated. 

2. 300 mg injection given once and then 150 mg injection given once a week for 5 weeks (Day 1 to Day 29) and then continued for another 7 weeks (Day 36 to Day 78). 6
If after 4 weeks the treatment in Group 2 went well then patients in Group 3 could be treated. 

3. 450 mg injection given once a week for 5 weeks (Day 1 to Day 29) and then continued for another 7 weeks (Day 36 to Day 78). 6
If after 4 weeks the treatment in Group 3 went well then patients in Group 4 could be treated. 

4. 300 mg injection given once a week for 5 weeks (Day 1 to Day 29) and then continued for another 7 weeks (Day 36 to Day 78). 7
It was planned that 6 patients would be included in Group 1 and while 8 were enrolled only 7 patients were treated with marstacimab as 1 withdrew their consent before receiving treatment. Patients with inhibitors to their factor replacement therapy could only join Group 4.

The study included patients who had severe hemophilia A or B, with or without “inhibitors”. Some patients with hemophilia can develop inhibitors in their blood to the proteins in factor replacement therapy. These inhibitors stop the clotting factors in the factor replacement therapy from working. This means that people with hemophilia who have these inhibitors may have more severe bleeds and may need higher doses of factor replacement therapy or alternative treatment(s) to stop any bleeding. Patients with inhibitors to their factor replacement therapy were only able to join Group 4. 

This was an open-label study, so everyone, including the patient, knew what treatment was given to each group. 
While patients were only in the study for 5 months, the entire study took 21 months to complete. The sponsor ran this study at 8 locations in 6 countries in North America, South America, Europe and South Africa. It began 08 March 2017 and ended 03 December 2018. 27 men participated and 26 were treated with marstacimab 

(1 patient decided he did not want to be treated with marstacimab before being given his first injection). All patients were between the ages of 19 and 63 years.

The 7 patients in Group 1 were treated first and were given 1 injection of marstacimab each week so that they received 5 injections of marstacimab. If these patients did not have many medical problems after 4 weeks, the 6 patients in Group 2 were treated. If the 6 patients in Group 2 did not have many medical problems after 4 weeks , then the 6 patients in Group 3 were treated. If the 6 patients in Group 3 did not have many medical problems after 4 weeks, then the 7 patients in Group 4 were treated.   

Patients were to be treated once a week for up to 3 months. Of the 26 patients who started the study, 24 (92%) finished the study and 2 (8%) did not finish the study because of medical problems. 

When the study ended in December 2018, the Sponsor began reviewing the information collected. The Sponsor then created a report of the results. This is a summary of that report.
