This study compared three groups of patients to find out if more patients taking PF-04965842 had their AD improve compared to patients taking a placebo. A placebo does not have any medicine in it, but it looks just like the study medicine. The study included adult men and women, and boys and girls who were aged 12 years and older. Patients included in the study:
-Had chronic (long-term) AD for at least 1 year, and had moderate to severe AD when they entered the study.
-Also had one of the following :
-Had been treated up to 6 months earlier for AD with medicines applied to the skin, and their AD did not get better;
-Were unable to use medicines on the skin because of a medical problem ;
-Needed to use medicines that reach all parts of the body to control their AD (for example, taking medicines by mouth).

The patients and doctors did not know who took PF-04965842 and who took the placebo. This is known as a “double-blinded” study. This is done to make sure the results of the research study cannot be unfairly influenced by anyone. Patients were assigned to one of three treatment groups by chance (like the flip of a coin or drawing straws) to receive either PF-04965842 at a dose of 100 mg, PF-04965842 at a dose of 200 mg or placebo. Patients had an 80% (4 out of 5) chance of receiving PF-04965842 and a 20% (1 out of 5) chance of receiving placebo. This is known as a “randomized” study.

This study used two different tests to measure the severity of the patients’ AD at the beginning of the study and throughout 12 weeks of treatment. The first test is called the Investigators Global Assessment (IGA) scale and measures the severity of AD on a 5-point scale (0 being the best and 4 being the worst). The second test is called the Eczema Area and Severity Index, and measures how severe a patient’s AD is based on four different signs, as well as the amount of skin affected by AD. The difference in each patient’s score between the start of the study and after 12 weeks of treatment was used to decide if their AD had improved.

While patients were only in the study for 12 to 16 weeks, the entire study took 15 months to complete. The Sponsor ran this study at 69 locations in eight countries in North America, Europe, and Australia. It began 07 December 2017 and ended 26 March 2019. A total of 167 women or girls and 220 men or boys participated. All patients were between the ages of 12 and 84.

Patients were to be treated until the end of the 12 week treatment period. Of the 387 patients who started the study, 333 finished the study. 25 patients did not finish the study because of medical problems. 13 patients left before the study was over by their choice or their parent’s choice, or a doctor decided it was best for a patient to stop being in the study.

When the study ended in March 2019 as planned, the Sponsor began reviewing the information collected. The Sponsor then created a report of the results. This is a summary of that report.
