How was the study done?
Researchers tested palbociclib (test medicine) combined with letrozole on a group of study participants with advanced breast cancer to find out if it provided a longer PFS than study participants with advanced breast cancer taking a placebo plus letrozole. A description of how the study was done can be seen in Figure 1 below.  
Figure 1. A description of how the study was done.  
After the last dose of palbociclib treatment, study participants were contacted by the study team every 6 months to ask about:  
- Any changes in the health of the participant  
- Any medications the participant was taking  
Study participants were assigned to each group by chance alone. Neither the study participants nor the researchers knew who took palbociclib and who took the placebo. This is known as a “blinded” study.  
Where did this study take place?  
The Sponsor ran this study at 52 locations across Mainland China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Thailand, and Singapore.  
When did this study take place?  
It began 23 March 2015, and the primary completion date was 31 August 2020. Primary completion date corresponds to the date when the last participant was examined or received treatment and that results for the main outcome were collected.  This study is ongoing.  
Who participated in this study?  
The study included participants with advanced breast cancer, who were between the ages of 18 and 70 years, had already experienced menopause, and had not received any systemic treatment for their advanced disease.  
- A total of 340 women participated and 339 women were treated in this study  
- All participants were between the ages of 29 and 70 years  
Participants were to be treated until disease progression, death, or inability to tolerate the treatment, or withdrawal of consent, whichever occurred first.  PFS was determined based on the disease progression or death of the study participants.  Of the 340 participants who started the study, 138 are still participating in the study.  
Two hundred and ninety participants discontinued the study treatment because:  
- The participant died  
- The participant was lost to follow-up  
- The participant’s cancer got worse  
- The participant experienced medical problems  
- The participants left by their choice or a doctor decided it was best for a participant to stop being in the study  
How long did the study last?  
The entire study took 5 years to the primary completion date, the study is still ongoing. However, when the primary completion point was reached in August 2020, the Sponsor began reviewing the information collected. The Sponsor then created a report of the results. This is a summary of that report.
