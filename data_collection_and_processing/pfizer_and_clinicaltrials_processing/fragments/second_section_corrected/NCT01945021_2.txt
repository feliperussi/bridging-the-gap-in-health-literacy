The study included patients who had NSCLC (referred to as “disease” in this summary) that was advanced or has spread to other parts of the body during or after earlier treatment and was caused by a defect in a gene called receptor tyrosine kinase (C-ROS1). 
A total of 129 patients with ALK-negative and ROS1-positive NSCLC joined this study and 127 patients were treated with crizotinib. 
This was an open-label study, which means that both the patients and researchers knew which study drug and dose they received. The figure below shows what happened during this study. 
Patients in this study took crizotinib 2 times per day in “cycles” that lasted 28 days. They began with a dose of 250 mg. The patients were watched closely for any medical problems. 
While patients were only in the study for an average of 102 weeks, the entire study took almost 7 years to complete. The Sponsor ran this study at 40 locations in 4 countries in East Asia (Japan, China, South Korea, and Taiwan). It began 25 September 2013 and ended 22 January 2020. Fifty-four (54) men and seventy-three (73) women participated. All patients were between the ages of 23 and 80. 
Patients were to be treated until their cancer stopped responding or got worse, until they developed unacceptable medical problems, or until they chose to stop treatment. 
Of the 127 patients who started the study, all patients stopped the study; 65 patients (51%) died. A total of 18 patients (14%) had stopped the study by their choice or a doctor decided it was best for a patient to stop the study. Forty-four (44) patients (35%) were still ongoing in the study when the study was closed and, if they were still on treatment, they were moved to either commercial treatment available in their country or they enrolled into another study (Study A8081067). 
When the study ended in January 2020, the Sponsor began reviewing the information collected. The Sponsor then created a report of the results. This is a summary of that report.
