How was the study done? Researchers tested PF-06700841 on a group of study participants to find out if study participants with PsA taking PF-06700841 (the test medicine) had a higher ACR20 score than study participants with PsA taking placebo. A description of how the study was done can be seen in Figure 1 below. Researchers wanted to know: Did the participants taking PF-06700841 have better effectiveness in the treatment of PsA when compared to placebo? Researchers wanted to determine the American College of Rheumatology 20 (ACR20) score of participants taking PF-06700841 and compare it to the ACR20 score of participants taking placebo after 16 weeks of treatment. 

The ACR20 score was used to assess and establish the improvement by 20% in tender swollen joints of participants along with a 20% improvement in at least three of the following five factors: Inflammation in joints; Participants' treatment response and progress; Doctors’ observations of participants' treatment response and progress; Daily pain in joints; How much PsA interferes with the participants daily activities.

Whether PF-06700841 caused any medical problems in participants? Researchers also wanted to learn more about the safety of PF-06700841. They monitored the participants for any medical problems that happened while they were in the study.

Figure 1. A description of how the study was done. The ACR20 was determined at 16 weeks. The study participants and researchers did not know who took PF-06700841 and who took the placebo. This is known as a “blinded” study. Study participants were assigned to each group by chance alone. The study was only slightly affected by the COVID-19 pandemic as the study participants had already completed the treatment portion of the study. 

Where did this study take place? The Sponsor ran this study at 47 locations in 11 countries in Australia, Asia, and Europe. When did this study take place? It began 13 June 2019 and ended 15 January 2021. Who participated in this study? The study included participants who were between the ages of 18 and 75 years old, had symptoms of PsA for at least 6 months, and had active PsA despite taking anti-inflammatory medications for at least 4 weeks before the start of the study.

A total of 102 men participated; A total of 116 women participated; All participants were between the ages of 21 and 73 years. Participants were to be treated until the ACR20 scores at the Week 16 and Week 52 study visits were determined. Of the 218 participants who started the study, 203 participants completed the study visit at Week 16. Of the 203 participants who completed the study visit at Week 16, 168 participants completed the study visit at Week 52. 

Fifteen participants did not complete the Week 16 study visit because: The participants left the study by their own choice, and/or; The participants did not experience an improvement in their PsA, and/or; The participants experienced medical problems. After Week 16, an additional 35 participants left before the study was over by their choice or a doctor decided it was best for a participant to stop being in the study. How long did the study last? 

Study participants were in the study for about 12 months. The entire study took 19 months to complete. When the study ended in January 2021, the Sponsor began reviewing the information collected. The Sponsor then created a report of the results. This is a summary of that report.
