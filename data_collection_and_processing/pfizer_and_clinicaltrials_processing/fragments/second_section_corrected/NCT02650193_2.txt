This study looked at how HSP-130 affects the body. The study included women with breast cancer who had never before taken chemotherapy. This was an “open-label” study, which means that both the patients and researchers knew what treatment was being given.

Since the study was divided into 2 parts, each patient took part in only Part 1 or Part 2. Patients were checked by the study doctor to make sure they were a good fit to join the study. This was called “screening”.

Part 1 - Without Chemotherapy: Part 1 lasted about 30 days and included 12 patients with breast cancer. The first 6 patients received 1 dose (3 mg) of HSP-130. The next 6 patients received 1 dose (6 mg) of HSP-130. HSP-130 was given as an injection just under the skin. The researchers tested patients’ blood throughout the study to see how the body responds to the HSP-130, and to decide if the lower dose (3 mg) would be used during Part 2 of the study.

Part 2 - With Chemotherapy: Part 2 lasted about 94 days and included 13 patients who had already had surgery for their breast cancer. This part of the study was divided into 4 “chemotherapy treatment cycles” that each lasted about 3 weeks. During each cycle, patients received 1 dose (6 mg) of HSP-130 (for a total of 4 doses), and chemotherapy as prescribed by their study doctor. The researchers tested patients’ blood throughout the study to learn how the body responds to the HSP-130. 

The figure below shows what happened during the study.

While patients were only in the study for about 1 month (Part 1) or 4 months (Part 2), the entire study took about 2 years to complete. Patients joined the study at 1 of 7 locations in Hungary and Spain. It began on 21-December 2015 and ended on 5-October 2017. A total of 25 women between the ages of 39 and 78 participated. All 25 patients (100%) completed the study. When the study ended in October 2017, the Sponsor reviewed the total information collected during the study. The Sponsor then created a report of the results. This is a summary of that report.
