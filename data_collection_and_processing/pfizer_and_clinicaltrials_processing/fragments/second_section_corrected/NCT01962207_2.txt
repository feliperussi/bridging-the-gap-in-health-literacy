This study compared 4 groups of children to learn more about the long-term effects of MenACWY-TT. The sponsor asked children who participated in a previous study on Nimenrix to join this study. All the children were healthy and had received vaccination with Nimenrix, Meningitec, or Mencevax during the previous study.

The children were placed in 4 groups (the same groups as the previous study): 

- Group 1: Children who received Nimenrix when they were between 1 and 2 years old (76 children) 
- Group 2: Children who received Meningitec when they were between 1 and 2 years old (23 children) 
- Group 3: Children who received Nimenrix when they were 2 to 10 years old (115 children) 
- Group 4: Children who received Mencevax when they were 2 to 10 years old (29 children) 

The children were asked to come to up to 5 visits, each a year apart, at the study center. This was known as the “persistence phase” of the study. During these visits, the researchers collected blood samples from the children. The researchers looked for antibodies in the blood against the 4 different types of meningococcus germ. 181 children received a booster dose of Nimenrix at study visit 5. This was known as the “booster phase” of the study.

This was an “open label” study, which means that the children, their parents/guardians, and the researchers knew which vaccine the children received. The figure on the following page shows what happened during this study.

Children were in this study for up to 4 years, but the entire study took almost 5 years to complete. Children joined the study at 1 of 9 locations in Finland. The first child joined the study on 09 October 2013 and the last child finished the study on 11 June 2018. A total of 122 girls and 121 boys joined the study. The children were between 7 and 18 years old when they began the study.

Children were supposed to come to up to 5 visits, each a year apart, at the study center. Of the 243 children who joined the study, 191 (79%) completed it. A total of 52 children (21%) left before the study was over by their parent/guardian’s choice or a doctor decided it was best for a patient to stop the study.

When the study ended in June 2018, the Sponsor began reviewing the information collected. The Sponsor then created a report of the results. This is a summary of that report.
