This study evaluated two groups of participants given weekly injections of Marstacimab at different doses. This was done to see if participants had any medical problems while taking Marstacimab and to see if this treatment could prevent bleeding episodes. The study was open to male participants, between 18 and 75 years old, with a diagnosis of severe hemophilia type A or B, with or without inhibitors. Twenty (20) participants enrolled in the study: 18 of these participants had participated in a previous Marstacimab study (B7841002) and the other 2 participants, both without inhibitors, were taking Marstacimab for the first time. This was an open-label study, so everyone, including the participants, knew what treatment was given to each group. 

While participants were only in the study for 1 year, the entire study took 26 months to complete. The Sponsor ran this study at 11 locations in 9 countries in Africa, Europe, North America and South America. It began 30 May 2018 and ended 05 August 2020. Twenty (20) men and no women participated. All participants were between the ages of 19 and 57 years old. 

Participants were to be treated until the end of their 1 year study period. Of the 20 participants who started the study, 18 finished the study. Two (2) participants left before the study was over by their choice or a doctor decided it was best for a participant to stop being in the study. 

When the study ended in August 2020, the Sponsor began reviewing the information collected. The Sponsor then created a report of the results. This is a summary of that report.
