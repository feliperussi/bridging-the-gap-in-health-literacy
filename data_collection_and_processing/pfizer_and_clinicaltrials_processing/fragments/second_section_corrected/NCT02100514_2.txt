Researchers wanted to know if patients taking a statin who took bococizumab had lower LDL cholesterol than patients who took a placebo. A placebo does not have any medicine in it, but looks just like the medicine being tested. This study included adult men and women who: 
- Had high cholesterol that required medicine to treat
- Were already taking a statin treatment for at least 6 weeks, and did not plan to change or stop taking their statin
- Had a high or very high risk of heart disease because of other health problems, like smoking, diabetes, or damage to their blood vessels.

Patients were assigned either bococizumab or placebo treatment by chance alone. This is known as a “randomized” study. This is done to make the groups more similar for things like age and the number of men and women. Reducing differences between the groups makes the groups more even to compare. 

The patients, study doctors, and Sponsor did not know who took what medicine during the study. This is known as a “double-blinded” study. Researchers use “double-blinded” studies to make sure that the results are not influenced in any way.

Descriptions of Medicines Given in Each Group:
- Group 1: Bococizumab 150 mg. This was used to see if bococizumab lowered LDL cholesterol.
- Group 2: Bococizumab placebo. This was used to compare bococizumab with taking no other medicine besides their statin.

For 4 weeks, patients were checked (screened) to make sure they met all the needs to be in the study. Next, patients were put into 1 of the 2 treatment groups and were treated for 1 year. Twice as many patients were assigned bococizumab as placebo (a 2:1 ratio). At the end of 1 year, patients were followed by researchers for 6 weeks (follow-up phase) to see how they did after taking the study medicines. 

While each patient was only in the study for about 14 months, the whole study took almost 2 years to finish. Of the 746 patients who started the study, 643 finished the whole study. 103 patients left before the study was over by their choice or a doctor decided it was best for a patient to stop the study. 2 patients died in the bococizumab group, and 2 patients died in the placebo group. Study doctors and the sponsor determined that study medicines did not cause their deaths. 

The study took place at 170 locations in 12 countries in North America and Western Europe, Eastern Europe, and Asia. It began on 28 October 2014 and ended 15 July 2016. 746 patients started this study. 416 patients were men and 330 patients were women. All patients were between the ages of 26 and 86. 

As soon as the study ended in July 2016, the Sponsor began looking at the study results. The Sponsor then created a report of the results. This is a summary of that report.
