How was the study done?

Researchers tested 2 different doses of danuglipron on a group of adult participants with obesity, but who were otherwise healthy, to learn how the amount of rosuvastatin and midazolam in the blood was changed when taken with danuglipron. Participants were to stay at the study center for study periods 1 to 8 and were to take rosuvastatin (one 10 mg dose), midazolam (one 2 mg dose) and danuglipron (at different doses) as follows:

- Period 1 (5 days): one dose of 10 mg rosuvastatin only
- Period 2 (2 days): one dose of 2 mg midazolam only on the first day
- Period 3 (28 to 29 days): gradual dosing of danuglipron up to 120 mg twice daily
- Period 4 (4 days): danuglipron 120 mg twice daily and one dose of 10 mg rosuvastatin on the first day
- Period 5 (1 day): danuglipron 120 mg twice daily and one dose of 2 mg midazolam
- Period 6 (16 days): gradual dosing of danuglipron up to 200 mg twice daily
- Period 7 (4 days): 200 mg danuglipron twice daily and one dose of 10 mg rosuvastatin on the first day
- Period 8 (2 days): 200 mg danuglipron twice daily and one dose of 2 mg midazolam on the first day

Researchers took samples of blood from participants during the study. Researchers also checked the participants’ health during the study and asked them how they were feeling.

At the end of Period 8, participants had to return to the study center 7 to 10 days after their last dose of study medication for health checks. They then received a telephone call 28 to 35 days after their last dose of study medication to check on their health.

The study design is shown in the following figure.

Researchers compared the levels of rosuvastatin and midazolam in the blood of participants who had taken these medicines along with 2 different doses of danuglipron.

The participants and researchers knew who took each type of medicine. This is known as an “open-label” study.

Where did this study take place? 

The Sponsor ran this study at a single location in the United States.

When did this study take place?

It began 15 December 2020 and ended 13 May 2021.

Who participated in this study? 

This study included adult participants with obesity, but who were otherwise healthy.
- A total of 8 men participated
- A total of 8 women participated
- All participants were between the ages of 30 and 63 years

Of the 16 participants who started the study, 13 participants finished the study. 

Three (3) participants stopped taking the study treatment by their choice or a doctor decided it was best for a participant to stop treatment. Two (2) of these participants stopped treatment, either permanently due to a fall or temporarily because of retching or dry heaving, and 1 participant stopped treatment because of other reasons.

How long did the study last?

Study participants were in the study for about 17 weeks. The entire study took around 5 months to complete. When the study ended in May 2021, the Sponsor began reviewing the information collected. The Sponsor then created a report of the results. This is a summary of that report.
