This study compared 3 groups of patients to find out if patients taking PF-06651600 or PF-06700841 had their AA improved compared to patients taking placebo. A placebo does not have any medicine in it, but looks just like the medicine. The study included adult men and women who were aged 18 to 75 years. Patients included in the study had moderate to severe AA with: at least 50% hair loss on the scalp and no hair growing back within 6 months. Current episode of hair loss started less than 7 years ago. The patients and researchers did not know who took PF-06651600, who took PF-06700841 and who took the placebo. This was done to make sure that the trial results were not influenced in any way. This is known as a "double-blinded" study.

Patients were put into 1 of 3 treatment groups by chance alone (like the flip of a coin or drawing straws) to receive either PF-06651600, PF-06700841, or placebo. Patients had a 33% (1 in 3) chance of receiving PF-06651600, a 33% (1in 3) chance of receiving PF-06700841, and a 33% (1 in 3) chance of receiving placebo in the initial 24 weeks of the treatment period. This is known as a "randomized" study. This is done to make the groups more similar. Reducing differences between the groups (like age or the number of men and women), makes the groups more even to compare.

While patients were only in the study for 24 weeks for the first part of the study, the entire study took 29 months to complete. The sponsor ran this study at 55 locations in 3 countries in Australia and North America. It began 15 December 2016 and ended 15 May 2019. Forty-four (44) men and 98 women participated. All patients were between the ages of 18 and 68 years old.

Patients were to be treated until the end of week 24. Of the 142 patients who started the study, 114 finished the initial 24-week treatment period. 8 patients did not finish the initial 24-week treatment period because of medical problems. Twenty (20) patients stopped taking the study medication by their choice or a doctor decided it was best for a patient to stop being in the study.

When the study ended in May 2019, the sponsor began reviewing the information collected. The sponsor then created a report of the results. This is a summary of that report.
