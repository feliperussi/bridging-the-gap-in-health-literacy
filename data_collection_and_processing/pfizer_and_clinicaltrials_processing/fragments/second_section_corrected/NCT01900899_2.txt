This study compared two groups of children to learn more about the long-term effects of MenACWY-TT. The sponsor asked children who participated in two previous studies on Nimenrix to join this study. All the children were healthy and had received two injections (primary injection plus booster injection) of Nimenrix or Meningitec during the previous studies.

The children did not receive any study vaccinations or other medicines during this study, since they had already received either Nimenrix or Meningitec during the previous studies. Instead, the children were asked to come to up to five visits, each a year apart, at the study center. During these visits, the researchers collected blood samples from the children. The researchers looked for antibodies in the blood against the four different types of meningococcus germ.

This was an "open label" study, which means that the children, their parents/guardians, and the researchers knew which vaccine the children received during the previous studies. The figure below shows what happened during this study.

Children were in this study for up to four years, and the entire study took a little more than four years to complete. Children joined the study at one of nine locations in Finland. The first child joined the study on 16 July 2013 and the last child finished the study on 08 November 2017. A total of 84 girls and 100 boys joined the study. The children were between 7 and 10 years old when they began the study.

Children were supposed to come to up to five visits, each a year apart, at the study center. Of the 184 children who joined the study, 174 (95%) completed it. A total of 10 children (5%) did not finish the study by their parent /guardian's choice.

When the study ended in November 2017, the Sponsor began reviewing the information collected. The Sponsor then created a report of the results. This is a summary of that report.
