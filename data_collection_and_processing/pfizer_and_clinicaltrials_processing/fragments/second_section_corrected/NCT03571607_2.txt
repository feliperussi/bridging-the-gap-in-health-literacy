This study compared two groups of participants, children and adolescents aged 6 to under 18 years and adults aged 18 to under 65 years, to find out if participants given 13vPnC were able to make antibodies that recognize 13 common types of S. pneumoniae. The researchers also wanted to see if the participants had any safety issues in the month after having the 13vPnC vaccine. The study participants were all Japanese people with illnesses that mean they are more likely to get pneumococcal disease. 

All participants in this study received a single dose of 13vPnC on day 1 at the start of the study. While participants were only in the study for approximately one month, the entire study took approximately four months to complete. The sponsor ran this study at eight locations across Japan. It began on 12 July 2018 and ended on 16 November 2018. There were 31 boys and 22 girls aged 7 to 17 years as well as 76 men and 77 women aged 18 to 64 years who participated. All of the 206 participants were between the ages of 7 and 64 years. 

Participants were given a single dose of the 13vPnC vaccine. Of the 206 participants who started the study, all 206 finished the study and all were asked to write down if they had experienced any reactions to the 13vPnC vaccine. 

When the study ended in November 2018, the Sponsor began reviewing the information collected. The Sponsor then created a report of the results. This is a summary of that report.
