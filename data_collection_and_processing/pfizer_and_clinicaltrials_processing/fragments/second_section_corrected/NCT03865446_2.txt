This study compared two groups of participants to find out what happens to dacomitinib in the body of participants who have severe hepatic impairment compared to participants with no hepatic impairment. The study included adult participants who weighed more than 50 kg (110 lb) with severe hepatic impairment or with no hepatic impairment. Participants were put into one of two treatment groups according to how well their liver was working. Participants with severe hepatic impairment joined the study first and patients with no hepatic impairment joined afterwards. The researchers tried to match the two groups so that the average age and average body weight of each group were similar. This meant the two groups were similar except for how well their livers were working. All participants in the study took dacomitinib.

While participants were only in the study for eight days (i.e., from the day before treatment until seven days after treatment), the entire study took just over six months to complete. The Sponsor ran this study at two locations in the US. It began on 05 April 2019 and ended on 24 October 2019. Sixteen men participated and all were between the ages of 52 and 68 years.

Participants were admitted to the study unit the day before they were treated and had to stay overnight without food during this time. This meant that when they were treated with a single dose of 30 mg dacomitinib they had not eaten for more than ten hours. Participants were then asked to stay in the study unit for seven days. Blood samples were taken during this time and they were asked about how they felt. Of the sixteen patients who started the study, all finished the study.

When the study ended in October 2019, the Sponsor began reviewing the information collected. The Sponsor then created a report of the results. This is a summary of that report.
