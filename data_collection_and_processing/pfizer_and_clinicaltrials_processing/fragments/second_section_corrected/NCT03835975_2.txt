This study was done to learn about the safety and the antibody response to 20vPnC in participants 65 years old and older. The vaccines used in this study included 20vPnC, 13vPnC, and PPSV23. This study included adult men and women who: 

- Were at least 65 years old 
- Were considered to be healthy or with stable chronic disease by the study doctors 
- Did not have a disease or take medicine that would be associated with a weakened immune system 
- Never had a disease caused by S.pneumoniae 
- Never had a severe medical problem caused by a vaccine or an allergic reaction to any of the components in the vaccines used in this study 
- Had previously been vaccinated with 13vPnC and/or PPSV23 

Participants were placed into 3 categories based on which vaccines they had previously received: 

- Category 1: Received PPSV23 between 1 and 5 years before the study started, but had never received 13vPnC (375 participants) 
- Category 2: Received 13vPnC at least 6 months before the study started, but had never received PPSV23 (375 participants) 
- Category 3: Received 13vPnC followed by PPSV23 1 year later, and the PPSV23 dose had been received at least 1 year before the study started (125 participants) 

Next, participants in Category 1 and Category 2 were assigned by chance alone to receive the following study vaccines: 

- Category 1: 1 dose of either 20vPnC (253 participants) or 13vPnC (122 participants) 
- Category 2: 1 dose of either 20vPnC (248 participants) or PPSV23 (127 participants) 

A control group is a group of participants who do not receive the vaccine being studied. In this study, 13vPnC and PPSV23 were used as the controls to look at safety of 20vPnC because they are commonly used in this age group. This was a “randomized” study, which means that participants were assigned to groups based on chance alone. Randomization is done to make the groups similar so that differences in antibody response or safety are most likely due to the different vaccines participants received. 

The participants who had been vaccinated with both 13vPnC and PPSV23 in the past (Category 3, 125 participants) received 20vPnC only. This study was also “open-label”. This means that participants and study staff members who administered the vaccine knew who was given which vaccine. 

However, the researchers who did the antibody testing did not know this information until after the antibody testing was completed. Participants were expected to participate in 3 study visits. At the first visit, participants were checked (screened) to make sure they were a good fit for the study, blood samples were collected, and then participants received study vaccine. The second visit was done about 1 month after the first visit. Participants were checked for medical problems and blood samples were collected. In the participants who received 20vPnC, the researchers measured the amount of antibodies in the blood. 

The third visit (follow-up) was done over the phone about 6 months after the first visit. The participants were asked about medical problems and whether they had received any other vaccines besides the study vaccines. 

The figure below shows what happened during the study. While participants were in this study for about 6 months, the entire study took 1 year to complete as participants entered the study at different times. The Sponsor ran this study at 33 locations in the United States and 8 locations in Sweden. It began 12 February 2019 and ended 12 February 2020. 398 men (46%) and 475 women (54%) received the study vaccines. All participants were between the ages of 65 and 92 years. 

Of the 875 participants who joined the study, 865 (99%) completed it. A total of 10 participants (1%) left the study early. The most common reasons for leaving early were the participant's choice or because a doctor decided it was best for them to leave the study. 

Throughout the course of the study, the Sponsor reviewed the data. When the study ended in February 2020 and after antibody testing was completed on the participants who received 20vPnC, the Sponsor then created a report of the results. This is a summary of that report.
