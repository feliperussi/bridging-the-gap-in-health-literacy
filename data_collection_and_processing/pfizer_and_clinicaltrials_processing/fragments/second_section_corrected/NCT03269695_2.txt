How was the study done?  
Researchers tested PF-06687234 in a group of study participants to find out if study participants taking this treatment could achieve remission of their UC when also given infliximab. Infliximab is a licensed treatment for UC. Researchers then compared the results of study participants taking the study medication to the results of study participants taking placebo and infliximab. A placebo does not have any medicine in it, but it looks just like the study medication. The study participants and researchers did not know who took PF-06687234 and who took the placebo. This is known as a “blinded” study. Study participants were assigned to each group by chance alone. The figure on the next page shows what happened during this study. 

SC = subcutaneous. 
Note: All participants were to remain in the study for 22 weeks even if they stopped the study treatment before they had completed 12 weeks of treatment so that they could be monitored for safety. 

Where did this study take place? 
The Sponsor ran this study at 27 locations in 11 countries in the United States, Europe, the Middle East, Asia, and Australia. 

When did this study take place? 
It began 20 December 2017 and ended 07 January 2021. 

Who participated in this study? 
The study included participants who had active UC and who had partially responded to treatment with infliximab, but who had not achieved remission. Participants did not have other bowel diseases, such as Crohn’s disease, infectious colitis, or colon cancer. 
- A total of 13 men participated  
- A total of 7 women participated  
- All participants were between the ages of 20 and 73 years. 
Participants were to be treated for 12 weeks with PF-06687234 and infliximab and a further 10 weeks when PF-06687234 was to be stopped but infliximab was continued. 

Of the 20 participants who started the study, 19 participants finished the study and completed the safety follow-up. There were 15 participants who finished the 12 weeks of treatment (7 in the PF-06687234 group and 8 in the placebo group) and 5 participants did not finish treatment. The participants who did not finish treatment included: 
- 3 participants in the PF-06687234 group  
- 1 participant because of medical problems  
- 1 participant because of lack of treatment effect  
- 1 participant by their own choice  
- 2 participants in the placebo group  
- Both because of medical problems. 

How long did the study last? 
Study participants were in the study for 22 weeks. The entire study ran for just over 3 years. This study was stopped because PF-06687234 was not working as well as the researchers hoped. 

When the study ended in January 2021, the Sponsor began reviewing the information collected. The Sponsor then created a report of the results. This is a summary of that report.
