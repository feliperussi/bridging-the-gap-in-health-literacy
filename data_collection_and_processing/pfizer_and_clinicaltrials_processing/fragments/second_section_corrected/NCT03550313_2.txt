How was the study done?
Researchers studied c7vPnC in a group of healthy infants to find out if infants had any health problems when given c7vPnC with or separately from Prevnar 13:
- When given both c7vPnC and Prevnar 13 at 2, 4, 6, and 12 months of age
- When given Prevnar 13 at 2, 4, 6, and 12 months of age, and c7vPnC at 3, 5, 7, and 13 months of age (every other month from Prevnar 13). 

Researchers then compared the results of infants getting both c7vPnC and Prevnar 13 (given either together or separately) at 2, 4, 6, and 12 months of age to the results of infants getting Prevnar 13 at 2, 4, 6, and 12 months of age and a supplemental dose of c7vPnC at 13 months of age. In this study, Prevnar 13 was used for comparison because it is an approved and recommended vaccine for use in infants for preventing S pneumoniae diseases. It was given to all infants in the study. 

The families of the infants and the researchers knew which infants were given c7vPnC at the same time as Prevnar 13, every other month (separately) from Prevnar 13, or as a supplemental dose after the 4 doses of Prevnar 13. This is known as an “open label” study. Infants were assigned to each group by chance alone. All infants had an equal chance of being assigned to each group.

Infants were expected to participate in 6 to 10 study visits, depending on which group they were in. At the visits, blood samples were collected, vaccines were given, and infants were checked for any medical problems. Families were also contacted over the phone about 6 months after the last vaccine, to check on the infant’s health.

Infants in this study also received a Pediarix vaccine (an infant diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, hepatitis B, poliovirus-containing vaccine recommended by the American Academy of Pediatrics) with the first 3 vaccinations. They may have also received other recommended vaccines at the visits or at other times while they were enrolled in the study, which were not part of the study.

The figure below shows what happened during the study.

Where did this study take place?
The Sponsor ran this study at 39 locations in the United States.

When did this study take place?
It began 01 June 2018 and ended 05 November 2020.

Who participated in this study?
Infants were checked (screened) by the study doctors to make sure they were a good fit for the study. 
This study included infants who:
- Were full term when they were born (at least 36 weeks into the pregnancy)
- Were about 2 months old when they joined the study
- Were considered to be healthy or with stable chronic disease by the study doctors
- Did not have a disease or take medicine that would be associated with a weakened immune system
- Had never received any vaccine for S pneumoniae.
 
565 infants joined this study, but 2 study sites were removed from participation in the study, leaving 512 infants remaining. Of these a total of 484 infants received at least 1 vaccine dose during the study:
- A total of 244 boys were vaccinated
- A total of 240 girls were vaccinated
- All infants were between the ages of 43 and 126 days at the start of the study. 

Out of the 512 infants in the study:
- 424 infants (83%) received Dose 3 of c7vPnC, and 376 infants (73%) completed their 1-month visit after Dose 3.
- 89 infants (17%) left the study before their 1-month visit after Dose 3, by their family’s choice, because a doctor decided it was best for the infant to stop being in the study, or the sponsor no longer required the visit.
- 296 infants (58%) received Dose 4 and 238 infants (47%) completed their 1-month visit after Dose 4. 37 infants (7%) left the study after Dose 4 but before their 1-month visit after Dose 4.
- 88 infants (18%) received the supplemental dose and 66 infants (13%) completed their supplemental dose 1-month visit. 15 infants (3%) left the study after Dose 4 but before their supplemental dose 1-month visit.
- Overall, 389 infants (76%) completed the 6-month follow-up phone visit, and 276 infants (54%) completed all study visits.

How long did the study last?
Infants were in the study for up to 17 months. The entire study took a little more than 2 years to complete.
When the study ended in 05 November 2020, the Sponsor began reviewing the information collected. The Sponsor then created a report of the results. This is a summary of that report.
