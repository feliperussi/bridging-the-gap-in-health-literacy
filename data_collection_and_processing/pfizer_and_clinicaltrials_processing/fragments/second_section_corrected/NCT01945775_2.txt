This study compared two groups of patients to find out if patients taking talazoparib had more time without their cancer getting worse compared to patients taking other commonly used chemotherapies. 

The study included patients who:
- Were at least 18 years old
- Had breast cancer that was advanced or had spread to other parts of the body 
  (also called “metastatic cancer”)
- Inherited the BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene mutation
- Did not have more than 3 chemotherapy treatments for their advanced cancer
- Had previously taken at least one of the commonly used cancer chemotherapies
- Had good organ function and adequate blood counts

This trial was an open-label study. This means that both the patient and the doctor knew whether the patient received talazoparib or chemotherapy.

Patients joined the study at one of 145 locations in the US, Europe (Belgium, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Poland, Spain, UK, Israel, Russia, and Ukraine), Brazil, South Korea, Australia, and Taiwan. It began on 14 October 2013 and ended on 05 March 2021. A total of 7 men and 424 women participated in this study. All patients were between the ages of 24 and 88. Patients were to be treated until their doctor determined that their cancer was getting worse, the side effects were too severe, or until they chose to stop participation in the study. All of the 431 patients who started the study had stopped treatment by the end of the study, mostly due to the patient’s cancer getting worse, the patient chose to stop, or a doctor decided it was best for a patient to stop their assigned treatment.

The Sponsor reviewed the study results in September 2017, September 2019, and March 2021. The Sponsor then created reports of the results collected up to those time points. This is a summary of those reports.
