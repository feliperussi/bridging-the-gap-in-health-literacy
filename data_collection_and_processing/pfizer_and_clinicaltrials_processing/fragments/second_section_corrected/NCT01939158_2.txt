How was the study done?
This study compared 4 groups of children to learn more about the effects of MenACWY-TT when given alone or together with 13-Valent Pneumococcal Conjugate Vaccine. Children were assigned to 1 of 4 groups by chance alone.
- Group 1: Children received 1 dose of MenACWY-TT (203 participants).
- Group 2: Children received 2 doses of MenACWY-TT, given 2 months apart (197 participants).
- Group 3: Children received 1 dose of MenACWY-TT together with 1 dose of 13-Valent Pneumococcal Conjugate Vaccine (201 participants).
- Group 4: Children received 1 dose of 13-Valent Pneumococcal Conjugate Vaccine, followed by 1 dose of MenACWY-TT given 2 months later (201 participants).

All children were between 12 and 14 months of age when they received their first dose of study vaccine. Children and their parents/guardians were expected to attend 7 in-person study visits and 1 phone visit. The researchers collected blood samples from the children throughout the study. They looked for antibodies in the blood against the four different types of meningococcus germ.

This was an “open label” study, which means that the children, their parents/guardians, and the researchers knew which vaccines the children received. 

Where did this study take place?
The study took place at 54 locations in 6 countries.

When did this study take place?
It began 02 October 2013 and ended 05 December 2019.

Who participated in this study?
Children were checked (screened) by the study doctors to make sure they were a good fit for the study. This study included children who:
- Were between 12 and 14 months of age when they received their first study vaccine.
- Were considered to be healthy or with stable chronic disease by the study doctors.
- Did not have a disease or take medicine that would be associated with a weakened immune system.
- Had never had meningococcal disease.
- Had been vaccinated with 13-Valent Pneumococcal Conjugate Vaccine and Diphtheria, Tetanus, and Pertussis containing vaccine (DTP) at least 5 months before joining the study.
- Had not received certain other vaccines.
- Had never had a severe medical problem or allergic reaction to any of the study vaccine ingredients.
- Parents/guardians were informed of the risks and benefits of this study and agreed to participate.

Of the 802 children who completed vaccination, 619 (77%) returned for their 5-year follow-up visit. 184 children (23%) left the study early by their parent/guardian’s choice or because they passed away for a reason that was not related to study vaccination (2 participants).

- A total of 375 girls (47%) were vaccinated.
- A total of 427 boys (53%) were vaccinated.
- All children were between the ages of 12 and 14 months when they received their first study vaccine.

How long did the study last?
Children were in the study for about 62 months. The entire study took more than 6 years to complete. This study was completed as planned. When the study ended in December 2019, the Sponsor began reviewing the information collected. The Sponsor then created a report of the results. This is a summary of that report.
