This study included three different age ranges of participants to learn about the safety and about the antibody response to 20vPnC. The main age range studied was participants 60 years old and above. The vaccines used in this study included 20vPnC, 13vPnC, PPSV23, and salt water (saline) placebo. A placebo is given in the same way as the vaccines used in study but does not have active ingredients. 20vPnC and 13vPnC looked the same, however, the saline and PPSV23 looked different and were injected by staff that were not involved in other aspects of the study. Participants were asked to turn their heads when the PPSV23 or saline was injected so they would not know which one they had received.

Participants were checked (screened) to make sure they were a good fit for the study. This study included adult men and women who: were at least 18 years old, were considered to be healthy or with stable chronic disease by the study doctors, did not have a disease or take medicine that would be associated with a weakened immune system, never received any vaccine for S.pneumoniae, never had a disease caused by S.pneumoniae, never had a severe medical problem caused by a vaccine or an allergic reaction to any of the components in the vaccines used in this study.

Participants of three different age ranges were entered into the study: 60 years of age and older (3009 participants), 50 through 59 years of age (445 participants), 18 through 49 years of age (448 participants). Next, participants in the three age ranges were assigned to vaccine groups by chance alone and received the following vaccinations: 

60 years and older: Vaccine Group 1: 20vPnC at Visit 1 and placebo at Visit 2 one month later (1507 participants), Vaccine Group 2: 13vPnC at Visit 1 and PPSV23 at Visit 2 one month later (1490 participants).

50 through 59 years of age: Vaccine Group 1: 20vPnC at Visit 1 (334 participants), Vaccine Group 2: 13vPnC at Visit 1 (111 participants).

18 through 49 years of age: Vaccine Group 1: 20vPnC at Visit 1 (335 participants), Vaccine Group 2: 13vPnC at Visit 1 (112 participants).

This was a “randomized” study, which means that participants were assigned to groups based on chance alone. Randomization is done to make the groups similar so that differences in antibody response or safety are most likely due to the different vaccines participants received.

This study was also “double-blinded”. This means that participants and study staff members who administered the vaccine did not know who was given which vaccine. This was done to make sure that the study results were not influenced in any way.

Participants 60 years of age and older were expected to participate in three study visits. At the first visit, blood samples were collected first and then participants received either 20vPnC or 13vPnC. The second visit was done about one month after the first visit. Blood samples were collected before the participants received either saline placebo or PPSV23, and they were checked for medical problems. The third visit was done about one month after the second visit. Blood samples were collected and participants were asked about medical problems.

Participants 18 to 59 years of age were expected to participate in two study visits. At the first visit, blood samples were collected first and then participants received either 20vPnC or 13vPnC. The second visit was done about one month after the first visit. Blood samples were collected and participants were asked about medical problems.

All participants were also contacted over the phone about six months after Visit 1. The participants were asked about medical problems and whether they had received any other vaccines besides the study vaccines.

While participants were in this study for about six months, the entire study took more than a year to complete as participants entered the study at different times. The sponsor ran this study at 61 locations in the United States and Sweden. It began 12 December 2018 and ended 16 December 2019. 1558 men (40%) and 2331 women (60%) received the study vaccines. All participants were between the ages of 18 and 91 years.

Of the 3902 participants who joined the study, 3690 (95%) completed it. A total of 212 participants (5%) left the study early. The most common reasons for leaving early were the participant's choice or because a doctor decided it was best for them to stop the study.

Throughout the course of the study, the sponsor reviewed the data. When the study ended in December 2019 and after antibody testing was completed, the sponsor then created a report of the results. This is a summary of that report.
