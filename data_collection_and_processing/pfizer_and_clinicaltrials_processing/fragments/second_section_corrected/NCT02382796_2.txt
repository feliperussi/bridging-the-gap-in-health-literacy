This study evaluated a group of patients who received dacomitinib in previous studies for advanced NSCLC to have them continue treatment with dacomitinib. The study included patients who had advanced NSCLC and who received dacomitinib in a previous study in Japan (Study A7471009 or Study A7471050) without unpleasant side effects based on the researcher’s evaluation. For this study, three different dose strengths of dacomitinib oral tablets were planned, 45 mg per day, 30 mg per day, and 15 mg per day. The dose strength patients started on in this study was the same as the dose the patient ended on in the previous study. There were seven patients included in this study; five patients started at a dose of 15 mg once a day and two patients started at a dose of 30mg once a day. 

This was an “open-label” study, which means that the patients and the researchers knew which medicine the patients received. The Sponsor ran this study in Japan. It began 10 July 2015 and ended 30 May 2019. Three men and four women participated. All patients were between the ages of 68 and 76 and had an average weight of 56 kg. The study doctor was allowed to change the strength of the dacomitinib dose during the study, depending on how the treatment made the patients feel. 

Patients were to be treated until there was evidence of the study drug helping to relieve NSCLC symptoms, as determined by the study doctor. All seven patients left before the study was over by their choice or a doctor decided it was best for a patient to stop being in the study, of which three patients left as dacomitinib became available on the market. When the study ended in May 2019, the Sponsor began reviewing the information collected. The Sponsor then created a report of the results. This is a summary of that report.
