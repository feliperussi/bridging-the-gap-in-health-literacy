How was the study done? Researchers tested 2 different regimens on a group of healthy male participants to learn how ervogastat was handled by the body:
- At the beginning of the first period (Regimen A), participants took one 300 mg dose of radiolabeled ervogastat by mouth.
- At the beginning of the second period (Regimen B), participants first took one 300 mg dose of unlabeled ervogastat by mouth. After 3 hours, the participants then received one 100 microgram (µg) dose of radiolabeled ervogastat by injection into a vein or intravenously (IV).

Researchers took samples of blood, urine, and feces from participants during the study and measured the amount of ervogastat and its metabolites. Researchers also checked the participants’ health during the study and asked them how they were feeling. A diagram of the study design is shown on the next page. This study was an “open-label” study. An open-label study means that the participants and researchers knew what was being given to each participant during the study.
