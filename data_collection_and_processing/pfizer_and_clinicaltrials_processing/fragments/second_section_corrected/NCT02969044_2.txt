This study compared two groups of patients taking either PF-06651600 or a placebo, to find out if they would have an improvement in RA. The study included adult patients with RA who had tried certain other RA medicines, such as methotrexate, but did not get adequate relief. The patients and researchers did not know who took PF-06651600 and who took the placebo. This is known as a “blinded” study. Patients were assigned to each group by chance alone. 
First, patients were screened by the study doctor to make sure they were a good fit to join the study. This was known as the “screening period”, which lasted up to 5 weeks. Next, patients were assigned to receive either PF-06651600 200 milligrams (mg) or a placebo. The medicines were taken by mouth every day for 8 weeks. During this time, patients were to continue taking methotrexate and certain other medicines, as prescribed by their doctor. Patients were assigned to each group by chance alone. Putting people into groups by chance helps make the groups more even to compare. 
After patients completed study treatment, there was a follow-up period that lasted for 4 weeks. The figure below shows what happened during this study. While patients were only in the study for about 12 weeks (treatment plus follow-up), the entire study took about 1 year to complete. The sponsor ran this study at 32 locations in 9 countries in Europe and North America. It began 20 December 2016 and ended 12 December 2017. 13 men (19%) and 57 women (81%) participated. All patients were between the ages of 24 and 74. Patients were to be treated for 8 weeks then complete the 4 week follow-up period. Of the 70 patients who started the study, 59 (84%) finished it. 11 patients (16%) left before the study was over by their choice or a doctor decided it was best for a patient to stop the study. 
When the study ended in December 2017, the Sponsor began reviewing the information collected. The Sponsor then created a report of the results. This is a summary of that report.
