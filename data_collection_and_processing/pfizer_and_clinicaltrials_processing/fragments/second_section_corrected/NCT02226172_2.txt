First researchers checked to see if patients were eligible to enter the study at the screening visit. Next, eligible patients were enrolled into the “Lead In” phase of the study and started the study medicine, Glasdegib at the Baseline visit. Over the course of the Glasdegib treatment, patients were evaluated for safety and remained on treatment for as long as they tolerated and derived clinical benefit from the treatment as determined by their study doctor. 

The picture below shows what happened during the study. Although the safety of Glasdegib was considered acceptable in the “Lead-In” phase of the study, the study did not proceed into the “Randomized” phase because Glasdegib did not appear to reduce the spleen volume. 

While patients were only in the study for about 8 months, the entire study took 4 years to complete. Some patients were in the study for longer than 8 months because they took the medicine as long as they were having clinical benefit from the study medicine.

The sponsor ran this study at 10 locations in 2 countries, in Japan and the United States. It began 06 October 2014 and ended 31 October 2018. 13 men and 8 women participated. All patients were between the ages of 58 and 83 years.

Patients were supposed to be treated with Glasdegib for at least 6 months. Of the 21 patients who started the study, 4 finished the 6 months of treatment with Glasdegib. 17 patients did not finish the study. 1 patient died before finishing the study due to progression of their disease. 12 patients did not finish the study because they discontinued due to a medical problem they experienced. 4 patients left before the study was over by their choice or a doctor decided it was best for a patient to stop the study.

When the study ended in October 2018, the sponsor reviewed the information collected. The sponsor then created a report of the results. This is a summary of that report.
