Researchers in this study initially intended to look at 3 groups of patients treated with fidanacogene elaparvovec at one of three dose levels. This was done to see if patients had any medical problems after this treatment and also to see if this treatment could prevent bleeding episodes. Fidanacogene elaparvovec was given as an intravenous (IV) infusion, which means that a needle is placed in the vein and the study drug slowly drips into the vein. 

A total of 22 patients were screened, 15 patients received fidanacogene elaparvovec. All 15 patients received the lowest dose in the study (5 x 1011vg/kg). No patient received the 2 higher doses of fidanacogene elaparvovec. Results presented here are from the lowest dose level.

Patients were treated with 100 IU/kg of their usual FIX protein product over more or less 10 minutes at Day 0 visit. After this, the patients were treated with fidanacogene elaparvovec (5 x 1011vg/kg) for approximately 60 minutes via infusion pump, as shown in the figure below.

This was an open-label study, so everyone, including the patient, knew what treatment was given.

The study included patients who were men of 18 years of age and older with less than or equal to 2% FIX levels.

While patients were only in the study for 1 year, the entire study took more than 3 years to complete. The Sponsor ran this study at 5 locations in 2 countries (Australia and United States). It began on 18th November 2015 and ended on 8th April 2019. All patients were men. All patients were between the ages of 18 and 61 years.

Patients were to be treated with a single IV infusion. Of the 15 patients who started the study, all finished the study.

When the study ended in April 2019, the Sponsor began reviewing the information collected. The Sponsor then created a report of the results. This is a summary of that report.
