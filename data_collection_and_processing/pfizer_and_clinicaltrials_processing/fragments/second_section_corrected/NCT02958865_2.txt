How was the study done? 

Researchers tested various doses of ritlecitinib or brepocitinib on groups of study participants to find out if study participants taking these study medicines experienced relief from their UC symptoms. 

- Ritlecitinib (total of 150 participants): 51 participants received 20 mg, 49 participants received 70 mg, 50 participants received 200 mg
- Brepocitinib (total of 142 participants): 48 participants received 10 mg, 47 participants received 30 mg, 47 participants received 60 mg
- Placebo (total of 25 participants) 

The study participants and researchers did not know who took ritlecitinib or brepocitinib and who took the placebo. This is known as a “double -blinded” study. Study participants were assigned to each group by chance alone. Researchers measured the symptom relief of UC for each treatment group by using a Mayo score. This is a scoring system that measures how many stools were passed each day, amount of rectal bleeding (if any), mucosal appearance (doctors use a camera on the end of a tube to look at the inside lining of the colon), and a rating of the disease by a doctor (normal, mild, moderate or severe).

The Mayo score ranges from 0 to 12:

- Mayo score 0 to 2: Participant is in remission (no disease activity)
- Mayo score 3 to 5: Participant has mild disease
- Mayo score 6 to 10: Participant has moderate disease
- Mayo score 10 and higher: Participant has severe disease 

All participants in the study started with moderate to severe UC according to their Mayo score. The difference in their score after the induction period would indicate how effective the study treatment was.

Where did this study take place? 

The Sponsor ran this study at 154 locations in 19 countries (United States, Australia, Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Denmark, Georgia, Germany, Hungary, Israel, Italy, Republic of Korea, Romania, Russian Federation, Serbia, Slovakia, Spain, Poland, Turkey and Ukraine).

When did this study take place?

It began 03 February 2017 and ended 10 May 2021.

Who participated in this study?

The study included participants who had moderate to severe UC, even although they had tried other treatments. A total of 182 men participated and a total of 135 women participated. All participants were between the ages of 18 and 73. Participants were to be treated in the induction period for 8 weeks. Of the 317 participants who started the study, 281 finished the induction phase. Ten (10) participants in the ritlecitinib group, 4 participants in the brepocitinib group, and zero participants in the placebo group, did not finish the induction phase because of medical problems.

Overall, 36 participants left before the study was over by their choice or a doctor decided it was best for a participant to stop being in the study.

How long did the study last?

Study participants were in the induction phase of the study for 8 weeks. The entire study took 51 months to complete. The study was completed as planned. When the study ended in May 2021, the Sponsor began reviewing the information collected. The Sponsor then created a report of the results. This is a summary of that report.
