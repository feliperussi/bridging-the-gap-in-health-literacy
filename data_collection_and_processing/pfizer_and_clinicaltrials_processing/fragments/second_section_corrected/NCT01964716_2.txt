This study included 500 infants in The Gambia. The infants who took part in this study were healthy and were between 6 and 10 weeks old when the study started. The study was explained to the parents, and each of the parents could choose whether they wanted their infant to be part of the study. 

The infants received all other vaccines that were recommended for them in The Gambia. In addition, 250 of the infants received Prevenar 13 from a single-dose syringe, and the other 250 infants received Prevenar 13 from a multi-dose vial. All of the infants received their first dose of Prevenar 13 at about 2 months of age. 

Each infant received another injection of Prevenar 13 when he or she was about 3 months old, and another when he or she was about 4 months old. After each injection, people working on the study went to visit the parentsâ€™ home every day for 5 days. They asked the parents about any health problems that the infants might be having, and they wrote down all of this information. 

When each infant was about 5 months old, the family met with the study doctors for the last time. The study doctors asked about any health problems that the infant might be having. They also collected a small amount of blood, about 1 teaspoon, from the infant. Tests were performed on the blood to find out how well the vaccine worked. 

Each infant was part of the study for about 3 months. Because the study included 500 infants, it took about 8 months to finish the whole study. It started on 09 January 2014 and finished on 01 September 2014. 

Of the 500 infants who started the study, 489 finished the study. 11 infants left the study before it was over. The most common reason why infants left the study was that their parents decided that they did not want their infant to be part of the study anymore.
