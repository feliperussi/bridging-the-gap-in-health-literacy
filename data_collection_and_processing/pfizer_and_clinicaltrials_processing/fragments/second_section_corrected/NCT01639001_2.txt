This study compared two groups of patients to find out if patients treated with crizotinib would have more time before their cancer began to grow, or before they passed away from any cause, compared to patients treated with platinum-based chemotherapy. The study included men and women who were 18 to 70 years of age who met the following criteria:

-Diagnosed with NSCLC that also had the following:

-Positive test for ALK fusion gene

-Locally advanced NSCLC and not suitable for local treatment, or

-Metastatic NSCLC (cancer had spread outside of the lungs)

-Had not been treated for their NSCLC before using “systemic” medicines (taken by mouth or intravenously)

-Had not been treated before with medicines that block ALK activity

-Had any major surgeries completed at least 4 weeks before entering the study

-Had any radiation procedures completed at least 2 weeks before entering the study, and had mostly recovered from radiation side effects

-Were able to at least walk around and care for themselves, and were out of bed at least 50% of the day.

The patients were assigned to either take 250mg of crizotinib twice daily by mouth, or to receive platinum-based chemotherapy. If the patient was assigned to receive platinum-based chemotherapy, they received standard doses of pemetrexed and either cisplatin or carboplatin, with the patient’s doctor deciding whether cisplatin or carboplatin was best for the patient. The patients were assigned to either group by chance alone. This is known as a “randomized” study. This is done to reduce the differences between groups (like age or the number of men and women), which makes the groups more even to compare. Patients who were assigned to receive platinum-based chemotherapy and had their NSCLC get worse were allowed to switch, or ‘cross over’, into the crizotinib treatment group.

The diagram below shows what happened during the study.

While patients taking crizotinib were treated for an average of 106 weeks, the entire study took over 7 years to complete. The sponsor ran this study at 35 locations in 5 countries in East Asia. It began 29 September 2012 and ended 08 January 2020. A total of 114 women and 93 men participated. All patients were between the ages of 23 and 69.

Patients were to be treated until their NSCLC got worse, they had too many medical problems or couldn’t tolerate the medicines, their overall health declined, or they passed away. Of the 205 patients who started treatment in the study, 55 finished the study. A total of 123 patients passed away before the study was completed, and 3 patients did not finish the study because of other reasons. Twenty-one (21) patients left before the study was over by their choice or a doctor decided it was best for a patient to stop being in the study. In addition, 3 patients were lost to follow-up.

When the study ended in January 2020, the sponsor reviewed the information collected. The sponsor then created a report of the results. This is a summary of that report.
