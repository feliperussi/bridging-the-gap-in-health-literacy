This study was done to learn more about the use of dalteparin in children who have a VTE. The children who entered the study had to have VTE, and may also have had a type of cancer. First, the children were checked by the study doctor to make sure they were a good fit for the study. This was called “screening”. The children were grouped by age:
- Group 1 (1 child): 0 weeks old to less than 8 weeks old
- Group 2 (2 children): At least 8 weeks old, but less than 2 years old
- Group 3 (8 children): At least 2 years old, but less than 8 years old
- Group 4 (7 children): At least 8 years old, but less than 12 years old
- Group 5 (20 children): At least 12 years old, but less than 19 years old

This was an “open label” study, which means that the children, their parents/guardians, and the study doctors knew which medicine the children received during the study. In this study, all children received dalteparin.
There were 3 phases to this study. Phase 1 was known as the “dose adjustment phase”. This phase started when the child received their first (starting) dose of study medicine and continued for up to 7 days.

The starting dose depended on the age and weight of the child, as follows:
- Group 1: 125 IU per kilogram (kg) of weight
- Group 2: 150 IU per kg of weight
- Group 3: 125 IU per kg of weight
- Group 4: 125 IU per kg of weight
- Group 5: 100 IU per kg of weight

Then, during this 7-day “dose adjustment phase”, the study doctors tested the child’s anti-Xa levels. Each child’s dalteparin dose was adjusted (upward or downward), as needed, until the child’s anti-Xa test result was between 0.5 and 1.0 (the “target” range). The dose that put the child’s anti-Xa level into that target range is called the “maintenance dose”. This is the dose that would be used going forward, in order to keep the child’s anti-Xa level within the target range.

Once the children had reached the target anti-Xa level, they entered Phase 2 of the study. Phase 2 was known as the “pharmacodynamics phase”, and it lasted between 1 and 7 days (enough time to collect 2 blood samples from each child). During this time, children received their maintenance dose from Phase 1, given every 12 hours.

After they completed Phase 2, the children entered Phase 3 of the study. Phase 3 was known as the “follow-up phase”, and it lasted until the end of the study. The children continued receiving their maintenance dose of dalteparin, given every 12 hours. The study doctors tested the children’s blood to make sure anti-Xa was still within the target range (0.5 to 1.0).
The figure below shows what happened during this study.

While children were only in the study for up to 90 days, the entire study took almost 9 years to complete. The sponsor ran this study at 15 locations in Norway, Russia, Slovenia, Spain, and the United States. It began 20 August 2009 and finished 20 March 2018. A total of 14 girls and 24 boys participated. All children were between the ages of 0 and 18 years old.

The study required the children to come to a total of 7 visits at the study center. Of the 38 children who were treated in the study, 26 children (68%) completed all of the study visits. At total of 12 children (32%) did not finish the study, either due to medical problems or by their parent/guardian’s choice.

When the study ended in March 2018, the Sponsor began reviewing the information collected. The Sponsor then created a report of the results. This is a summary of that report.
