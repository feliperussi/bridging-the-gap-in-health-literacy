How was the study done?
Researchers tested the study treatments of abrocitinib tablets, abrocitinib liquid (Liquid 1), and abrocitinib tablets when taken 2 hours after famotidine on groups of healthy participants to learn how abrocitinib acted in the body in Part A. The researchers also wanted to know what the participants thought about the taste of different abrocitinib liquids in Part B. Participants had to stay at the study center for the entire study (Part A and Part B). Participants were assigned to each group by chance alone and the treatments in Part A and in Part B were given in a random order as shown in the following figure. In Part A, participants were to take abrocitinib tablets, abrocitinib liquid (Liquid 1), and abrocitinib tablets 2 hours after having taken famotidine tablets. The dose of abrocitinib was 200 milligrams or mg and this was taken after an overnight fast (nothing to eat or drink except water). The participants took the study treatments in a random order. The participants and the researchers knew who was taking what treatment and this is known as an “open-label study”. There was to be at least 3 days between each dose in Part A, and also 3 days between Period 3 of Part A and Period 4 of Part B. 

In Part B, participants were to take all 6 different liquid formulations of 200mg abrocitinib and were asked about the taste. The 6 liquids were to be taken in a random order with at least 1 day between each dose. Some participants also took famotidine. The participants did not know what was in each formulation of abrocitinib, but the researchers knew what was in the liquids. This is known as a “single-blind study”. The results of this taste testing are not included in this report. 

Researchers took samples of blood and urine from participants during the study for safety tests and for testing for abrocitinib. Researchers then compared the levels of abrocitinib in the blood of the participants. Researchers also checked the participants’ health during the study and asked them how they were feeling.

Where did this study take place?
