This study compared 3 groups of participants to learn about the body’s antibody response to 20vPnC. The information from the combined 20vPnC groups and a “control group” that received 13vPnC were used to learn about safety. A control group is a group of participants that do not receive the vaccine being studied. In this study, 13vPnC was used as the control because it is commonly used for preventing S. pneumoniae diseases.

Participants were checked (screened) to make sure they were a good fit for the study. This study included adult men and women who:
- Were between the ages of 18 and 49 years
- Were considered to be healthy or with stable chronic disease by the study doctors
- Did not have a disease or take medicine that would be associated with a weakened immune system
- Had never received any vaccine for S.pneumoniae

This was a “randomized” study, which means that participants were assigned to groups based on chance alone. Randomization is done to make the groups similar so that differences in antibody response or safety are most likely due to the different vaccines people received. 

This study was also “double-blinded”. This means that participants and study staff members who administered the vaccine did not know who was given which vaccine. This was done to make sure that the study results were not influenced in any way.

Participants who were a good fit for the study were assigned by chance alone to receive 1 of 4 vaccines:
- 20vPnC, Lot 1 (488 participants)
- 20vPnC, Lot 2 (489 participants)
- 20vPnC, Lot 3 (486 participants)
- 13vPnC (245 participants)

Participants were expected to participate in 3 study visits. At the first visit, blood samples were collected, and the participants received the vaccine. The second visit was done about 1 month after the first visit. Blood samples were collected, and participants were checked for any medical problems. The third visit was done over the phone at the end of the study, and participants were asked about any medical problems.

While participants were in this study for about 6 months, the entire study took about 9 months to complete since not all participants entered the study at the same time. The Sponsor ran this study at 21 locations in the United States. It began 14 February 2019 and ended 9 October 2019. 593 men (35%) and 1115 women (65%) participated. All participants were between the ages of 18 and 49 years.

Of the 1708 participants who joined the study and received vaccine, 1635 (96%) finished it. A total of 73 participants (4%) left the study early by their choice or because a doctor decided it was best for them to stop the study.

Throughout the course of the study, the Sponsor reviewed the data. When the study ended in October 2019 and after antibody testing was completed, the Sponsor then created a report of the results. This is a summary of that report.
