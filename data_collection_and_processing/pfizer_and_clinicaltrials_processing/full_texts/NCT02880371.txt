2WHY WAS THIS STUDY DONE?
Many treat ments for cancer work by trying to help the body’s immune system attack 
and kill cancer cells.  However, these treatments do not work for all patients, and 
some only work for a short time before the patient’s cancer gets worse.  Researchers 
think that comb ining different medications that help the immune system fight cancer 
in different ways could help patients’ cancer get better.
ARRY -382 is a study drug that has not been approved by the United States Food and 
Drug Administration (FDA).  ARRY -382 is taken by mouth once a day.  ARRY -382 is 
thought to work by helping the immune system slow or stop the growth of cancer 
cells.  Pembrolizumab is approved by the FDA for the treatment of patients with 
many different types of cancer, and is given through a needle i nto a vein (IV).  
Pembrolizumab also works by helping the immune system slow or stop the growth of 
cancer cells, but in a different way than ARRY -382.  Studies in animals found that 
combining these 2 types of medicines helped the immune system do a better job of 
slowing the growth of tumors.
This study was divided into 2 parts, or “phases”. The main purpose of the first phase 
of the study (Phase 1) was to determine the best dose of ARRY -382 to use in Phase 2 
when given with the drug pembrolizumab.  To do this, the researchers asked,
What dose -limiting toxicities, or “DLTs”, did patients have when taking 
ARRY -382 with pembrolizumab?
DLTs are certain medical problems caused by taking ARRY -382 with 
pembrolizumab which require the patient to lower the dose or stop taking the 
medicine temporarily or permanently.
Phase 2 of the study was designed to see whether ARRY -382, when taken together 
with the drug pembrolizumab, had a beneficial effect on the patients’ cancer 
(improved symptoms, reduced rate of tumor growt h or decreased the size of tumors 
in the body). To do this, the researchers asked,
How many patients had their cancer get better when taking ARRY -382 
with pembrolizumab?
The researchers also monitored the patients for any medical problems that they had 
during the study.

3WHAT HAPPENED DURING THE STUDY?
This study included patients who met the following conditions:
Aged 18 years or older
For Phase 1:
oDiagnosed with one of certain types of cancer, such as of the ovaries, 
breast, head and neck, bladder, colon, pancreas, stomach, skin, or lung
oCancer had not responded to standard treatment, was not currently 
treatable, or the patient had refused standard treatment
For Phase 2:
oAdvanced solid tumor cancer that had gotten worse while being treated 
with certain typ es of anti -cancer therapy (called “PD -1/PD -L1 inhibitor 
resistant”)
oAdvanced cancer of the ovaries, abdomen (peritoneum), or fallopian 
tubes that got worse within 6 months of being treated with ≥ 4 cycles of 
platinum -based chemotherapy (called “platinum -resistant”)
oAdvanced pancreatic cancer (PDS) that had been treated at least once 
before
Able to walk around, take care of themselves, and do light house work or office 
work
Had adequate kidney, liver, bone marrow, and heart function
Had not been treated bef ore with cancer medications called ‘checkpoint 
inhibitors’ (such as a PD -1, PD -L1, or CTLA -4 inhibitor)
This was an “open -label” study, which means that the patients and doctors knew what 
dose of ARRY -382 and pembrolizumab the patients were receiving. 
What happened during Phase 1 of the study?
Phase 1 of this study compared 3 groups of patients that were assigned to 1 of 3 doses 
of ARRY -382 (either 200 mg, 300 mg, or 400 mg per day) to find the recommended 
dose of ARRY -382 for the Phase 2 portion of the study.  The figure below shows 
what happened during Phase 1 of the study.

4During Phase 1, each patient took 1 of 3 doses of ARRY -382 in pill form, once daily 
by mouth for 21 days.  The patients were also treated with pembrolizumab IV once 
every 3 weeks and monitored for medical problems.
What happened during Phase 2 of the study?
Phase 2 of this study compared 3 groups of patients with different types of cancer to 
see if their cancer got better with ARRY -382 and pembrolizumab treatment.  Based 
on the Pha se 1 results, all of the patients in Phase 2 were assigned to take 200 mg 
ARRY -382 once daily.  The figure below shows what happened during Phase 2 of the 
study.

5While many patients were only in the study for a few months, the entire study took 
just over 3years to complete.  The Sponsor ran this study at 15 locations in the 
United States of America.  It began on 01 September 2016 and ended 
24October 2019.  A total of 10 men and 9 women participated in Phase 1 and 
22men and 35 women participated in Phas e 2.  All patients were between the ages of 
30 and 8 7. 
Patients were to be treated until their cancer stopped responding or got worse, until 
they developed unacceptable medical problems, or until they chose to stop treatment.  
All patients who started Pha se 1 or Phase 2 of the study stopped taking the study 
medicines before the study ended.  Most patients left before the study was over 
because their cancer had gotten worse, by their choice, or because a doctor decided it 
was best for a patient to stop bein g in the study.

6This study was stopped when early results showed that too few patients had their 
cancer get better when taking ARRY -382 and pembrolizumab.  When the study ended 
in October 2019, the Sponsor reviewed the information collected.  The Sponsor t hen 
created a report of the results.  This is a summary of that report.
WHAT WERE THE RESULTS OF THE STUDY?
During Phase 1 of the study, what dose -limiting toxicities (DLT) 
were reported when taking ARRY -382 with pem brolizumab?
During Phase 1, researchers wanted to find the correct dose of ARRY -382 for treating 
patients with cancer when taken with pembrolizumab.  To find the correct dose, the 
researchers needed to know how many patients in each dose group had a DLT during 
their first 21 -day treatment cycle.
There were 2 patients who took 400 mg ARRY -382 and 1 patient who took 300 mg 
ARRY -382 who had DLT .  Of the 3 patients, 1 had increased muscle enzyme levels in 
their blood (CPK), 1 had increased liver enzymes in their blood (ALT/AST and 
bilirubin), and 1 h ad acute pancreatitis.  S ome of the other patients who took 200 mg, 
300 mg, or 400 mg of ARRY -382 once a day had other medical problems that caused 
them to temporarily stop or lower their dose of ARRY -382.  Using this information, 
the researchers decided t hat 300 mg once a day was the correct ARRY -382 dose to 
use with pembrolizumab during Phase 2 of the study.
During Phase 2 of the study, how many patients had their cancer get 
better when taking ARRY -382 with pembrolizumab?
One (1) patient out of 27 (4%) with pancreatic cancer (PDA) had their cancer get 
better while taking ARRY -382 with pembrolizumab.  None of the patients with 
“PD-1/PD -L1 inhibitor resistant” cancer or “platinum -resistant” ovarian cancer had 
their cancer get better.  The percentage of pat ients whose cancer stayed the same was 
42% for PD -1/PD -L1 refractory cancer, 19% for pancreatic cancer (PDA), and 36% 
for platinum -resistant ovarian cancer.  These results did not show that one treatment 
was better than another.  The differences seen could have been due to chance.

7This does not mean that everyone in this study had these results.  Other studies may 
produce different results, as well.  These are just some of the main findings of the 
study, and more information may be available at the websit es listed at the end of this 
summary.  
WHAT MEDICAL PROBLEMS DID 
PARTICIPANTS HAVE DURING THE STUDY?
The researchers recorded any medical problems the participants had during the study.  
Participants could have had medical problems for reasons not related to the study (for 
example, caused by an underlying disease or by chance).  Or, medical problems could 
also have been caused by a study treatment or by another medicine the participant was 
taking.  Sometimes the cause of a medical problem is unknown.  By c omparing 
medical problems across many treatment groups in many studies, doctors try to 
understand what the side effects of an experimental drug might be.
Eighteen (18) out of 19 patients in Phase 1 of this study had at least 1 medical 
problem.  Two (2)patientsin Phase 1 left the study because of medical problems.  
Fifty-six (56) of 57 patients in Phase 2 of this study had at least 1 medical problem.  A 
total of 10 patients in Phase 2 left the study because of medical problems.  The most 
common medical pro blems in Phase 1 and Phase 2 are listed below and on the next

WERE THERE ANY SERIOUS MEDICAL 
PROBLEMS?
A medical problem is considered “serious” when it is life -threatening, needs hospital 
care, or causes lasting problems.  A total of 7 patients in Phase 1 (37%, or 7 out of 
19patients) had serious medical problems.  A total of 28 patients in Phase 2 (49%, or 
28 out of 57 patients) had serious medical problems.  Most were not thought to be 
related to ARRY -382 treatment.  Fifteen (15) patients in Phase 1 and 35 patients in 
Phase 2 passed away during the study.  Most deaths were due to the patients’ cancer 
getting worse.  The most common serious medical problems in Phase 1 and Ph ase 2 
are shown in the table on the next page.
