1CLINICAL TRIAL RESULTS
This summary reports the results of only one study.  Researchers must look at the 
results of many types of studies to understand if a study medicine works, how it 
works, and if it is safe to prescribe to patients.  The results of this study might be 
different than the results of other studies that the researchers review.

2WHY WAS THI S STUDY DONE?
Acute myeloid leukemia (or “AML”), myelodysplastic syndrome (or “MDS”), and 
chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (or “CMML”) are types of blood cancers that 
usually affect patients over the age of 40.  These cancers are caused by too many 
immature white blood cells being made in the bone marrow.  This reduces the ability 
of the body to make normal blood cells such as white blood cells (that fight off 
infections), red blood cells (that deliver oxygen to muscles and organs), and platelets 
(that help blood clot).  
The treatment options for AML, MDS, and CMML are limited if the patient can’t 
receive “intensive” chemotherapy (strong medications) because of other medical 
problems.  Researchers are looking for new medicines that can help patients with 
AML , MDS, and CMML live longer without their cancer rapidly getting worse.
Glasdegib (now approved under the brand name Daurismo®in the United States) was 
the investigational medicine tested in this study, and it was not yet approved at the 
beginning of this study.  Glasdegib was developed to help reduce growth of cancerous 
stem cells in the bone marrow.  Cancer stem cells are cells that self -regenerate and 
contribute to tumor growth.  These cancer stem cells may be one of the reasons why 
some cancers return after chemotherapy treatment.  
The main pu rpose of this study was to learn more about the use of glasdegib in 
patients with AML, MDS, and CMML, when given in combination with a 
chemotherapy medicine called azacitidine.  Azacitidine is the standard treatme nt that 
is usually given for patients with AML, MDS, and CMML.  This study was divided 
into 2 parts, or “phases”.  Researchers asked these questions :
Phase 1: What me dical problems did patients have during treatment with 
glasdegib and azacitidine ?
Phase 2: How many patients would achieve “complete remission” when 
taking glasdegib and azacitidine ? 
In this study, complete remission or complete response meant that the patients no 
longer had any evidence of AML, MDS , or CMML .

3WHAT HAPPENED DURING THE STUDY?
This study included patients who:
Were diagnosed with AML ,or medium to high risk MDS or CMML , and had 
not received treatment for their AML , MDS, or CMML before  
Aged ≥18 years 
Had adequate liver and kidney function
Were appropriate for treatment with az acitidine
Able to walk around, take care of themselves, and be active for more than 50% 
of the day (Phase 1 only)
Were not healthy enough to be treated with intensive chemotherapy (Phase 2 
only)
What happened during Phase 1 of the study?
During Phase 1 of this study , 12 patients received glasdegib in combinatio n with 
azacitidine.  The goal of Phase 1 was to learn more about the safety of glasdegib in 
combination with azac itidine.  The starting dose of glasdegib was 100 mg in pill form, 
once daily by mouth for28 days. The starting dose of azacitidine was75 mg per 
square meter of body surface area , given as injections under the skin .  Patients took 
azacitidine in cycles, which means that it was taken for only the first 7 days of each 
28days.  The patients were monitored for medical problems.
What happened during Phase 2 of the study?
The goal of Phase 2 was to find out how many patients would achieve complete 
remission.  30 patients with MDS or CM ML and 30 patients with AML received 
glasdegib in combinatio n with aza citidine. The starting dose of glasdegib was 100 mg 
in pill form, once daily by mouth for 28 days. The starting dose of azacitidine was 
75mg per square meter of body surface area , given as injections under the skin or into 
the vein .  Patients took azacitidine in cycles, which means that it was taken for only 
the first 7 days of each 28 days.  Patients with MDS or CM ML were monitored for at 
least 28 weeks, and patients with AML were monitored for at least 24 weeks.
The figure below shows what happened during the study.

4The amount of time that patients were in the study varied depending on their 
response to study treatment , but the entire study took almost 5 years to complete.  
The Sponsor ran this study at 32 locations in 6 countries in North America and 
Europe.  It began 28 April 2015 and ended 29 January 2020.  A total of 5 women 
(42%) and 7 men (58%) participated in Phase 1, and 18 women (30%) and 42 men 
(70%) participated in Phase 2.  All pati ents were between the ages of 55 and 89 . 
Patie nts were t o be treated until their AML, MDS , or CMML stopped responding or 
got worse, until they developed unacceptable medical problems, or until they chose to 
stop treatment or started a new treatment for AML, MDS, or CCML .  Of the 
60patients who starte d Phase 2 of the study, 21 were still in the study at the time of 
this report .  A total of 3 9patients left Phase 2 before the st udy was over by their 
choice, because a doctor decided it was best for a patient to stop being in the study , or 
because the pat ient died .  This included 15 patients (50%) with MDS or CMML and 
090177e194ca8c27\Approved\Approved On: 01-Sep-2020 02:57 (GMT)
524 patients (80%) with AML.  Patient death was the most common reason that 
patients left the study early. 
When the study ended in January 2020 , the Sponsor reviewed the information 
collected .  The Sponsor then created a report of the results.  This is a summary of that 
report.
WHAT WERE THE RESULTS OF THE STUDY?
During Phase 2 of the study, how many patients achieved 
complete remission while taking glasdegib?
6 out of 30 patients with AML (20%) achieved complete remission during Phase 2 .  
4out of 30 patients with MD Sor CMML (13%) achieved complete remission during 
Phase 2 .  Based on these results, the researchers have decided that the results are not 
likely due to chance.  The test medici ne may be an option for treating patients with 
AML, MDS, or CMML.
These results are shown in the graph below .

6This does not mean that everyone in this study had these results.  Other studies may 
produce different results, as well.  These are just some of the main findings of the 
study, and more information may be available at the websites listed at the end of this
summary.  
WHAT MEDICAL PROBLEMS DID PATIENTS 
HAVE DURING THE STUDY?
The researchers recorded any medical problems the patients had during the study.  
Patients could have had medical problems for reasons not related to the study (for 
example, caused by an underlying disease or by chance).  Or, medical problems could 
also have been caused by a study treatment or by another medicine the patient was 
taking.  Sometimes the cause of a medical problem is unknown.  By comparing 
medical problems across many treatm ent groups in many studies, doctors try to 
understand what the side effects of an experimental drug might be.
During Phase 1, all patients in this study (100%) had at least 1 medical problem.  A 
total of 6patients (50%) left the study because of medical p roblems .  Researchers also 
looked at how severe the medical problems were determined to be by the study 
doctors. The most common medical problems during Phase 1 are listed below , along 
with their severity .

10WERE THERE ANY SERIOUS MEDICAL 
PROBLEMS?
A medical problem is considered “serious” when it is life -threatening, needs hospital 
care, or causes lasting problems.  
During Phase 1, 9out of 12 patients (7 5%) had serious medical problems , including
7patients (58%) with serious medical problems that were considered to be related to 
study treatment.   The table below shows the most common serious medical problems 
during Phase 1, along with their severity.
