2WHY WAS THIS STUDY DONE?
Atopic dermatitis (or “AD”), which is also sometimes called atopic eczema, is a 
common skin disorder that causes patches of flaky, red, and very itchy skin.  AD 
occurs in 1% to 3% of adults and 15% to 20% of children worldwide.  Some of the 
current medicines available for AD can only be used for short time periods, or can 
cause other health problems.  Researchers are looking for new treatments for AD that 
can be taken for long periods of time.
While researchers think that many things cause AD, it is made worse by the body’s 
immune system (the body’s defense against infection) causing redness and swelling 
(inflammation).  Cells in the immune system cause inflammation by making special 
proteins called “cytokines”.  Researchers think that medicines that lower the amount 
of cytokines that the body makes could help treat patients with AD. 
The drug tested in this study was PF -04965842, which now has the generic name 
abrocitinib.  Abrocitinib is an experimental drug that has not been approved for sale.  
Abrocitinib blocks the activity of a protein called “Janus kinase 1”, which acts like a 
switch for the cells of the immune system.  By turning off this switch, the cells of the 
immune system are expected to produce fewer cytokines that are believed to make 
AD worse.  The researchers wanted to ask,
• Are patients who take abrocitinib more likely to have their AD 
improve compared to patients who are treated with a placebo?  
To do this, researchers u sed 2 tests to measure the severity of each patient’s AD at the 
beginning of the study.  The researchers measured the severity of AD during 12 weeks 
of study treatment.  The difference in severity was used to decide if a patient’s AD 
had improved or not.
WHAT HAPPENED DURING THE STUDY?
This study compared 3 groups of patients to find out if patients taking abrocitinib had 
their AD improved compared to patients taking placebo.  A placebo does not have 
any medicine in it, but looks just like the medicine.

3The study included adult men and women, and adolescents who were aged 12 years 
and older.  Patients included in the study:
Had chronic (long -term) AD for at least 1 year, and had moderate to severe 
AD when they entered the study.
Also had one of the followin g: 
oHad been treated up to 6 months earlier for AD with medicines 
applied to the skin, and their AD did not get better;
oWere unable to use medicines on the skin because of a medical 
problem;
oNeeded to use medicines that reach all parts of the body to contr ol 
their AD (for example, taking medicines by mouth).
The patients and researchers did not know who took abrocitinib and who took the 
placebo.  This is known as a “double -blinded” study.  This is done to make sure the 
results of the research study cannot b e unfairly influenced by anyone .  Patients were 
assigned to 1 of 3 treatment groups by chance alone (like the flip of a coin or drawing 
straws) to receive either abrocitinib at a dose of 100 mg, abrocitinib at a dose of 200 mg, 
or placebo.  Patients had an 80% (4 out of 5) chance of receiving abrocitinib and a 
20% (1 out of 5) chance of receiving placebo.   This is known as a “randomized” study.

4This study used 2 different tests to measure the severity of the patients’ AD at the 
beginning of the study an d throughout 12 weeks of treatment.  The first test is called 
the Investigators Global Assessment scale and measures the severity of AD on a 
5-point scale (0 being the best and 4 being the worst).  The second test is called the 
Eczema Area and Severity Ind ex, and measures how severe a patient’s AD is based on 
4different signs, as well as the amount of skin affected by AD.  The difference in 
each patient’s score between the start of the study and after 12 weeks of treatment 
was used to decide if their AD ha d improved.
While patients were only in the study for 12 weeks, the entire study took 14 months to 
complete.  The sponsor ran this study at 106 locations in 13 countries in the United 
States, Poland, Republic of Korea, Japan, Australia, Bulgaria, Canada, Germany, 
United Kingdom, China, Latvia, Hungary, and Czech Republic .  It began 
29June 2018 and ended 13 August 2019.  A total of 229 men or boys and 162 women 
or girls participated.  All patients were 12 years of age or older.  The average age of 
patients in this study was 31 years.  Approximately 10% of the patients were between 
the older than 12 and younger than 18 years of age.

5Patients were to be treated until the end of the 12 -week treatment period.  Of the 
391patients who started the study, 52 out of 78 patients (67%) that received placebo 
finished the study, 137 out of 158 patients (87%) that received 100 mg abrocitinib 
finished the study, and 141 out of 155 patients (91%) that received 200 mg abrocitinib 
finished the study.  Some patients did not finish the study because 26out of 
78patients (33%) on placebo, 21 out of 158 patients (13%) on 100 mg abrocitinib, 
and 14 out of 155 patients (9%) on 200 mg abrocitinib left before the study was over 
by their choice or a doctor decided it was best for a patient to stop the study.
When the study ended in August 2019, the Sponsor began reviewing the information 
collected.  The sponsor then created a report of the results.  This is a summary of that 
report. 
WHAT WERE THE RESULTS OF THE STUDY?
Were patients who took abrocitinib more likely to have their 
AD improve compared to patients who took placebo?
In this study, more patients in the abrocitinib 100 mg or 200 mg treatment groups had 
their AD improve compared to the placebo group.  
When the change in sev erity of AD was measured using the Investigator’s Global 
Assessment scale, 44 out of 155 evaluated patients (28%) in the abrocitinib 100 mg 
treatment group and 59 out of 155 patients (38%) in the abrocitinib 200 mg treatment 
group had their AD improve to ‘ clear’ or ‘almost clear’ (score of 0 or 1) and had an 
improvement of 2 points or more in their AD after 12 weeks.  In comparison, 7 out 
of 77 patients (9%) in the placebo group had their AD improve to ‘clear’ or ‘almost 
clear’ after 12 weeks.  
When the ch ange in severity of AD was measured using the Eczema Area and 
Severity Index, 69 out of 155 patients (45%) in the abrocitinib 100 mg treatment 
group and 94 out of 154 patients (61%) in the abrocitinib 200 mg treatment group 
had their AD improve by at least 75% after 12 weeks.  In comparison, 8 out of 
77patients (10%) in the placebo group had their AD improve by at least 75% after 
12weeks.  
These results are also shown in the graphs below.

6Based on these results, the researchers determined that the re sults are not likely due to 
chance.  Abrocitinib may be an option for treating AD in adults and in children aged 
12years and older.
This does not mean that everyone in this study had these results.  Other studies may 
produce different results, as well.  T hese are just some of the main findings of the 
study, and more information may be available at the websites listed at the end of this 
summary.

7WHAT MEDICAL PROBLEMS DID PATIENTS 
HAVE DURING THE STUDY?
The researchers recorded any medical problems the participants had during the study. 
Participants could have had medical problems for reasons not related to the study (for 
example, caused by an underlying disease or by chance).  Or, medical problems could 
also have been caused by a study treatment, or by another medicine the participant 
was taking.  Sometimes the cause of a medical problem is unknown.  By comparing 
medical problems across many treatment groups in many studies, doctors try to 
understand what the side effects of an experimental drug might be .
All 391 patients in this study had at least 1 medical problem.  A total of 10 out of 
78patients (13%) who took placebo, 6 out of 158 patients (4%) who took abrocitinib 
100mg, and 5 out of 155 patients (3%) who took abrocitinib 200 mg left the study 
because of medical problems.  The most common medical problems are listed below.

9WERE THERE ANY SERIOUS MEDICAL 
PROBLEMS?
A medical problem is considered “serious” when it is life -threatening, needs hospital 
care, or causes lasting problems.  
Eight patients had serious medical problems as shown in the below table.  One out of 
78patients (1%) in the placebo group, 5 out of 1 58patients (3%) in the abrocitinib 
100mg group, and 2 out of 155 patients (1%) in the abrocitinib 200 mg group had 
serious medical problems.  Six patients each had 1 serious medical problem and 
2patients had 2 serious medical problems each.  There was 1 patient who died during 
the study.  The researchers assessed that the study medication did not cause the death 
and that the patient passed away due to other medical problems.
