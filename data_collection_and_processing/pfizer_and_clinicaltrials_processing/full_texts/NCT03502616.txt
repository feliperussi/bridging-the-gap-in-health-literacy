1CLINICAL TRIAL RESULTS
This summary reports the results of only one study.  Researchers must look at the 
results of many types of studies to understand if a study medicine works, how it 
works, and if it is safe to prescribe to patients.  The results of this study might be 
different than the results of other studies that the researchers review.

2WHY WAS THIS STUDY DONE?
Ankylosing spondylitis (AS) is a disease that can cause pain and swelling 
(inflammation) in the joints around the spine.  This is because the immune system, 
whose job is to attack foreign invaders like viruses and other germs, mistakenly 
attacks the joints instead.  
Patients with AS may have pain and stiffness in the lower back, buttocks, or neck, 
along with mild fever and fatigue. There is no cure for AS at this time, but common 
treatments for AS include medicines that control pain, reduce inflammation, and 
prevent the immune system from attacking the joints.  
Tofacitinib is an oral (taken by mouth) medicine that may reduce the activity of the 
immune system.  It is being studied as a possible treatment for adults with AS, but is 
not approved for this use outside of research studies like this one.  In this study, 
researchers wanted to learn more about the use of tofacitinib in people who had not 
been helped by or could not tolerate other drugs for AS, including non -steroidal 
anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID s) and/or tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors. 
Researchers did this study to find out if tofacitinib, when compared to placebo, 
reduced AS symptoms and improved a patient’s ability to perform physical activities 
(improved physical functioning).  Researc hers wanted to answer this question:  
Does tofacitinib 5 mg given twice per day improve pain, inflammation, and 
physical functioning in patients with AS who were not helped by other drugs, 
compared to placebo?
WHAT HAPPENED DURING THE STUDY?
This study co mpared 2 groups of patients to find out if patients who took tofacitinib 
5 mg twice per day had an improvement in AS symptoms and physical functioning, 
compared to patients who took placebo.  A placebo does not have any medicine in it, 
but looks just like the medicine being tested.  Using a placebo helps researchers learn 
if the study drug works better than no treatment at all.

3This study included adult men and women who:
Had AS that was confirmed by X -ray
Were not helped by or could not tolerate treatmen t with NSAIDs, or treatment 
with both NSAID sand TNF inhibitors
Patients were checked (screened) to make sure they were a good fit for the study. 
Patients who were a good fit were assigned by chance alone to receive either 
tofacitinib or placebo for 16 wee ks.  This is known as a “randomized” study.  This is 
done to make the groups more similar.  Reducing differences between the groups (like 
age or the number of men and women) makes the groups more even to compare. 
This part of the trial was also “double -blinded”.  This means that patients and doctors 
did not know who was given which treatment.  This was done to make sure that the 
trial results were not influenced in any way.
After 16 weeks of double -blinded treatment, all patients were switched to 
“open -label” treatment with tofacitinib for 32 weeks.  Open -label means that both the 
doctors and patients knew which treatment they received.  Finally, patients were 
expected to complete a 28 -day follow -up period after they finish study treatment.
The figure be low shows what happened during the study.

4Patients were expected to be in the study for about 56 weeks total.  The Sponsor ran 
this study at 95 locations in Asia, Australia, Europe, and North America.  It began on 
7June 2018 and ended on 20 August 2020.   A total of 224 men (83%) and 45 women 
(17%) participated.  All patients were between the ages of 20and 70years. 
Of the 269 patients who started the study and received treatment, 252 (94%) 
completed it.  A total of 17 patients (6%) left the study early by their choice or 
because a doctor decided it was best for them to stop the study.
When the study ended in August 2020, the Sponsor began reviewing the information 
collected.  The Sponsor then created a report of the results.  This is a summary of that 
report.
WHAT WERE THE RESULTS OF THE STUDY?
Does tofacitinib 5 mg given twice per day improve pain, 
inflammation, and physical functioning in patients with AS 
who were not helped by other drugs, compared to placebo?
To answer this question, researchers used a scoring tool called the “ASAS20” to look 
at 4areas: spine pain, inflammation, physical functioning, and the patient’s own 
opinion on how they thought they were doing.  To achieve an ASAS20 score, the 
patients needed at least a 20% improvement in at least 3 of these areas, without 
worsening of more than 20% in the remaining area.  The researchers compared the 
percentage of patients (number of patients out of 100) in each treatment group 
(tofacitinib or placebo) who achieved ASAS20 at the end of the 1 6-week double -blind 
treatment period. 
In this study, 75 out of 133 patients (56%) who received tofacitinib during the 
16-week double -blind treatment period achieved an ASAS20 score.  40 out of 
136patients (29%) who received placebo during the 16 -week dou ble-blind treatment 
period achieved an ASAS20 score.  The figure below shows these results.

5Based on these results, the researchers have decided that the results are not likely the 
result of chance.  Tofacitinib may be an option for treating patients wit h AS who were 
not previously helped by other drugs.
This does not mean that everyone in this study had these results.  Other studies may 
produce different results, as well.  These are just some of the main findings of the 
study, and more information may be available at the websites listed at the end of this 
summary.  
WHAT MEDICAL PROBLEMS DID PATIENTS 
HAVE DURING THE STUDY?
The researchers recorded any medical problems the participants had during the study.  
Participants could have had medical problems for reasons not related to the study (for 
example, caused by an underlying disease or by chance).  Or, medical problems could 
also have been caused by a study treatment or by another medicine the participant was 
taking.  Sometimes the cause of a medical probl em is unknown.  By comparing 
medical problems across many treatment groups in many studies, doctors try to 
understand what the side effects of an experimental drug might be.

6The researchers looked at medical problems that happened during the first 48 weeks
of the study.
196 out of 269 patients (73%) in this study had at least 1 medical problem, including 
103 out of 133 patients (77%) who received tofacitinib and 93 out of 136 patients 
(68%) who received placebo for 16 weeks and switched to open -label tofaci tinib. A 
total of 1 patient (less than 1%) left the study because of medical problems.  The most 
common medical problems are listed in the table below.

7WERE THERE ANY SERIOUS MEDICAL 
PROBLEMS?
A medical problem is considered “serious” when it is life -threatening, needs hospital 
care, or causes lasting problems.  
During the 48 -week period, 9 out of 269 patients (3%) had serious medical problems.  
7 patients out of 133 (5%) who received tofacitin ib and 2 patients out of 136 (2%) 
who received placebo for 16 weeks and switched to tofacitinib had at least 1 serious 
medical problem.  No patients died during this study.  The serious medical problems 
are listed in the table below.
