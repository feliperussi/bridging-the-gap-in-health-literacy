2WHY WAS THIS STUDY DONE?
Candida is a type of fungus that is normally found in small amounts in the human 
body.   Sometimes, too much Candida can grow in the body and cause health 
problems.  This is known as a Candida infection.  
The name “invasive Candida infection” is used when the infection has spread to other 
parts of the body through the bloodstream.  Certain medicines or diseases, like cancer, 
may make a child more likely to develop an invasive Candida infection.
Anidulafungi nis a medicine that is currently used to treat Candida infections in adults.  
This study was designed to learn more about using anidulafungin to treat Candida
infections in children .  Anidulafungin has not been approved for use in children , as it 
is still being studied.
The main purpose of this study was to learn more about the safety of anidulafungin in
children with invasive Candida infection. The researchers wanted to answer this 
question:
Did the children in this study have any new or worsening medical problems?  If 
so, w hat new or worsening medical problems did the children have?
The researchers also wanted to learn more about how anidulafungin works to treat 
invasive Candida infection in children.  The researchers wanted to answer this 
question:
How many children were cured or had an improvement in Candida infection?
WHAT HAPPENED DURING THE STUDY?
This study was for children who were diagnosed with invasive Candida infection , or 
who were at high risk for getting an invasive Candida infection. The children in this 
study were at least 1 month old , but younger than 18years oldwhen the study started .  
First, the children were checked by the study doctor to make sure they were a good fit 
for the stu dy.  This was called “screening”.

3The children were grouped by age:
Group 1 (19 children) : At least 1 month old , but younger than 2 years old 
Group 2 (19 children) : At least 2 years old, but younger than 5 years old
Group 3 (30 ch ildren) : At least 5 years old, but younger than 18 years old
All the children in this study were given anidulafungin by IV (a needle in the vein), 
and the doses were based on each child’s weight.  On the first day of treatment, 
children were given 3 milligrams (mg) of anidulafungin per kilogram (kg) of weight.  
From the second day of treatment onwards , children were giv en 1.5 mg of 
anidulafungin per kg of weight.  Children were supposed to receive anidulafungin for 
at least 10 days if they had a Candida infection and at least 5 days if they were at high 
risk of getting a Candida infection .
After the anidulafungin treat ment, the study doctor may have decided to switch s ome 
of the children to another antifungal medicine called fluconazole, given by mouth , to 
continue treatment of the Candida infection . All children could receive up to 35 days 
of anidulafungin and up to 4 9 days of total treatment (anidulafungin + fluconazole) .  
This was an “open -label” study, which means that the researchers , the children, and 
the children’s parents/caregivers knew which medicines were being given.   
Safety was carefully considered throughout the study.  The study doctors examined 
each child, did blood /urine tests, and watched for any medical problems.   The study 
doctors also followed up with the children for 6 weeks after their last dose of study 
treatment.
The figure on the followi ng page shows what happened during this study.

4While children were only in the study for up to 13weeks (treatment plus follow -up), 
the entire study took about 9 years to complete.  Children joined the study at 1 of 26
locations in 10 countries ( Brazil, Canada, Greece, Italy, Republic of Korea, Russia, 
Spain, Taiwan, United Kingdom, and United States). The first child joined the study 
on27 February 2009 and the last child finished the study on 14 February 2018.   A 
total of 30girls and 38boys joined th e study.   
Patients we re supposed to receive study treatment for up to 35 days and come to 
2follow -up visit s at week 2 and week 6of the study . Of the 68 children who started 
the study, 58 children (85%) completed it.  Ten ( 10)children (15%) did not finish the 
study by their choice or because they passed away.   The study doctors determined that 
none of these deaths were related to the study treatment.
When the study ended in February 20 18, the Sponsor began reviewing the 
information collected.  The Sponsor then created a report of the results. This is a 
summary of that report.
WHAT WERE THE RESULTS OF THE STUDY? 
How  many children were cured or had an improvement in 
Candida infection?
For the 64 patients who had a Candida infection in this study, s tudy doctors examined 
how well the study treatment worked on the last day the child received study 
treatment (anidulafungin alone and anidulafungin + fluconazole) and at the follow -up 
visits.

5On the last day that all study treatment was received, Candida infection was either 
cured or improving in 46 (72%) children . At the last follow -up visit, Candida infection 
wascured in 43(67%) children .  The percentage of children who were cured in this 
study was similar to the percentage of cured patients in previous adult studies with 
anidulafungin.  
This does not mean that everyone in this study had these results.  Other studies may 
produce different results, as well.  These are just some of the main findings of the 
study, and more information may be available at the websites listed at the end of this 
summary.  
WHAT MEDICAL PROBLEMS DID PATIENTS
HAVE DURING THE STUDY?
The researchers recorded any medical problems the children hadduring the study. 
Children could have had medical problems for reasons not related to the study (for 
example, caused by an underlying disease or by chance). Or, medical problems could 
have been caused by a study treatment, or by another medicine the child was taking. 
Some times the cause of a medical problem is unknown. By comparing medical 
problems across many treatment groups in many studies, doctors try to understand 
what the side effects of an experimental drug might be.
Out of 68children in this study , 66children (97%)had at least 1 medical problem .  
The most common medical problems reported in children in this study are listed 
below.

WERE THERE ANY SERIOUS MEDICAL 
PROBLEMS?
A medical problem is considered “serious” when it is life -threatening, needs hospital 
care, or causes lasting problems.  
Out of 68 children in this study , 30 children (44%) had a serious medical problem .
For 3 childr en, study doctors determined that 1medical problem for each child
(diarrhea, bleeding of the stomach/intesti nes, high liver enzyme tests that may 
indicate liver damage) may have been related to the study treatment.  Eight (8) 
children ( 12%) passed away during the study.  The study doctors determined that 
none of these deaths (0%) were related to the study treatment.
Overall, the medical pro blems reported in this study were similar to the medical
problems reported in past studies with adults and arein line with medical problems
expected in children with Candida infection.  No new issues related to the safety of the 
study treatment were found.
