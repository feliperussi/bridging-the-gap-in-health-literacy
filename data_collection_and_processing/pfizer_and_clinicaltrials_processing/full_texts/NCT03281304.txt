2WHY WAS THIS STUDY DONE?
Ulcerative colitis (“UC”) is a long -term inflammatory bowel disease that causes 
inflammation (swelling) and ulcers (sores) in the digestive tract.  UC affects the 
mucosa (inner lining) of the large intestine (colon) and rectum.   Patients with UC 
experience occasional periods of increased inflammation, known as flares.  Flares are 
chara cterized by diarrhea (loose stools) and presence of blood in the stools, as well as 
sense of urgency.  Flares are followed by periods of remission (time with no 
symptoms) that vary in length from weeks to years.
There is no known cure for UC.  Treatment ca n greatly reduce signs and symptoms of 
UC and can even lead to long -term remission.  However, t here are few treatment 
options for patients with moderately to severely active UC.  Medication is the most 
common treatment for UC.  Tofacitinib is a medicine th at works to reduce the activity 
of the immune system.  It is an oral (taken by mouth) medication that has been 
approved, and is available by prescription, to treat adults with active, moderate to 
severe UC that did not respond well to other medications .
Researchers have continued to study tofacitinib to find out more about its safety and 
how well it works.  In one study , researchers saw that participant swith UC who took 
either 5mg or 10 mg of tofacitinib twice a day were more likely to stay in remission 
compared to participants who took placebo.  H owever, a formal study to compare a 
reduced dose of tofacitinib (5 mg twice a day) to the standard dose (10 mg twice a 
day) of tofacitinib had not been done.
In this study, researchers wanted to find out if participants with UC who were in 
stable remission (ongoing time with no symptoms) would stay in remission if the dose 
of the treatment was reduced from 10 mg of tofacitinib twice a day to 5 mg of 
tofacitinib twice a day.  Researchers wanted to answer the question:
What difference did switching from 10 mg of tofacitinib twice a day to 5 mg 
of tofacitinib twice a day have on the percent of participants in remission after 
6months compared to staying on 10 mg of tofacitinib tw ice a day?
Researchers also wanted to learn more about the safety of tofacitinib in participants

3who switched from 10 mg of tofacitinib twice a day to 5 mg of tofacitinib twice a day 
compared to participants who continued to take 10 mg of tofacitinib twice a day .  
They monitored participants for any medical problems that happened while they were 
taking tofacitinib .
The results for the primary endpoint (percent of participants in remission after 
6months) as well as safety results for participants from the start of the study until 
February 2020 (27 months) are summarized here.
WHAT HAPPENED DURING THE STUDY?
This study compared 2groups of participants with UC to find out how many
participants who were in stable remission and switched from taking 10mg tofac itinib
twice a day to 5 mg tofacitinib twice a day would be in remission 6 months later
compared to participants who continued to take 10mg tofacitinib twice a day .The 
study included participants who:
Were participating in another study of tofacitinib ( Study A3921139 ),
Had been taking 10 mg tofacitinib twice a day fo r at least 2 years in a row,
Were in stable remission for UC on 10 mg tofacitinib twice a day for 6 months 
prior to beginning this study , and
Had not been taking any oral corticosteroids for their UC for at least 4 weeks 
prior to beginning this study.
Participants were put into 1 of 2 treatment groups by chance alone.  This is known as 
a “randomized” study.  This is done to make the groups more similar.  Reducing 
differences between the groups (like age or the number of men and women), makes 
the groups more even to compare.
This trial was also “double -blinded”.  This means that participants and doctors did 
not know who was given which dose of tof acitinib .  This was done to make sure that 
the trial results were not influenced in any way.

4Each participant in the study took 2 pills twice a day by mouth:
5mg tofacitinib group: one 5 mg tofacitinib tablet and one placebo tablet 
twice a day (70 out of 140 participants in the study).
10mg tofacitinib group: two 5 mg tofacitinib tablets twice a day (70 out of 
140 participants in the study).
A placebo does not have any medicine in it, but it looks just like the study medicine.  
The pills for theinvestiga tional medicine looked exactly the same as the pills for the 
placebo.  This made it so that participants did not know to which study group they 
were assigned.
During the entire study, participants are to co me to the study site 17 times over 42 
months and havetheir UC assessed.  At 4of these visits, participants are to have a
lower endoscopy (flexible sigmoidoscopy/colonoscopy) to look for swelling or 
unusual changes to the lining of their colon .  A lower endoscopy uses a tiny camera 
on the end of a thin, flexible tube that is inserted into the anus to view the inside of 
the rectum and most of the colon.
The participant’s UC disease activity was measured using a modified Mayo score.  The 
modified Mayo score rates the activity of UC based on 3 categories.  Each category is 
graded from 0 to 3, with 3 being the most severe.  The 3 categories are:
Stool frequency (how many bowel movement s per day ?)
Rectal bleeding (is blood s een in the stool?)
Endoscopy results (how does the lining of the colon look?)
The scores from each of the 3 categories were added together to give the modified 
Mayo score.  The modified Mayo score rates the disease activity of UC on a scale 
from 0 to 9 .  Participants who had a score of 0 or 1 for the endoscopy results, a stool 
frequency score of 0 or 1, and a score of 0 for rectal bleeding were said to be in 
remission.  Any participant who experienced a wor sening of their UC disease activity 
(flares) was allowed to have their dose adjusted during the study.

5This report summarizes the findings for the primary endpoint in this study.  The 
primary endpoint is the main question in a study that researchers want to answer.  In 
some studies, like this one, results for the primary endpoint are studied while 
participants are still taking part in the rest of the study. In this study, the primary 
endpoint was studied (“primary analysis”) after all participants had been on the study 
for 6 months.  The percentage of participants in remission after taking tofacitinib for 
6months was calculated for participants in the 5 mgand 10 mg tofacitinib groups.  
The percentage of participants in remission after 6 months was compared between 
the 2 groups.
The figure below shows what is to happen during the entire study.
The Sponsor is running this study at 69locations in 20countries in Europe, North 
America, Asia, Africa, and Oceania .  The primary endpoint of the study whose results 
are reported here began 16November 2017 and ended 20February 2020; the rest of 
090177e196b5cffe\Approved\Approved On: 06-Apr-2021 07:09 (GMT)6the study is ongoing .  Ninety -two (92) men and 48 women participated.  All 
participants were between the ages of 21 and 81.   Results for the rest of the study will 
be reported when all participants have completed th e entire study.
Participants were to be treate d for 42 months, with the primary analysis occurring 
after all participants had taken tofacitinib for 6 months . Of the 140participants who 
started the study, 115finished the first 6 month partof the study . Twenty -five ( 25)
participants did not finish the first 6 month portion of the study; of these,
2participants from the 5mg group did not finish because their UC worsened and 
1participant from the 5mg group did not finish because their UC worsened and 
1participant from the 5 mg group did not finish due to pregnancy.  Twenty -two (22) 
participants left before the first 6 month part of the study was over by their choice or 
a doctor decided it was best for a participant to stop being in the study.
When datacollection for the primary endpoint ended in February 2020 , the Sponsor 
reviewed the information collected for the primary endpoint . The Sponsor then 
created a report of th oseresults. This is a summary of that report.
WHAT WERE THE RESULTS OF THE STUDY?
What difference did switching from 10 mg of tofacitinib 
twice a day to 5 mg of tofacitinib twice a day have on the 
percent of participants in remission after 6 months 
compared to staying on 10mg of tofacitinib twice a day ?
In this study, more than 75% (3 out of 4) of all participants in the study were in 
remission after 6 months of taking tofacitinib.  More participants in the 10 mg group 
(90%) were in remission after 6 months of taking tofacitinib compared to participants
in the 5 mg group (77%).

WHAT MEDICAL PROBLEMS DID 
PARTICIPANTS HAVE DURING THE STUDY?
The researchers recorded any medical problems the participants had during the study.  
Participants could have had medical problems for reasons not related to the study (for 
example, caused by an underlying disease or by chance).  Or, medical problems could 
also have been caused b y a study treatment or by another medicine the participant was 
taking.  Sometimes the cause of a medical problem is unknown.  By comparing 
medical problems across many treatment groups in many studies, doctors try to 
understand what the side effects of an experimental drug might be.
Fifty ( 50)out of 140 participants in this study had at least 1 medical problem.  A total 
of 9participants left the study because of medical problems.  Of these, 1 participant
in the tofacitinib 5 mg group and 1 participant in the tofacitinib 10 mg group left the 
study due to medical problems which the researchers believed to be related to 
tofacitinib .  The most common medical problems are listed below.

9WERE THERE ANY SERIOUS MEDICAL 
PROBLEMS?
A medical problem is considered “serious” when it is life -threatening, needs hospital 
care, or causes lasting problems.
Ten (10) participants (7%) had serious medical problems: 6participants in the 
tofacitinib 5 mg group and 4participants in the tofacitinib 10 mg group.  Two (2) of 
the 6 participants in the tofacitinib 5mg group had a flare and were allowed to start 
taking 10 mg of tofacitinib.   The serious medical problem for these 2 participants
happened after they started taking 10 mg of tofacitinib.  No participants died during 
the study.  The serious medical problems reported by participants in the study are 
shown in the table below.   Some participants reported more than 1 serious medical 
problem.
