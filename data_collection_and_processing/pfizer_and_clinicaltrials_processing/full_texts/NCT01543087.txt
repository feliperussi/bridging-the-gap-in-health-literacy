2WHY WAS THIS ST UDY DONE?
“Meningococcal disease ”is an infection that can cause swelling around the brain and 
spinal cord.  The risk of m eningococcal disease is increased in adolescents andyoung 
adults.  People who get meningococcal disease are at risk for hearing loss and other 
disabilities .  Howeve r, meningococcal disease may be prevented with a vaccine.   A 
vaccine is a medication that helps people fight off germs.
Meningococcal dis ease is caused by the meningococcus germ.   There are different 
types of this germ.  For example, m eningococcal type B disease is caused by the 
meningococcus B germ.  Since v accines were available to help fight off other types of 
meningococcus germ, but not type B ,research ers were interested in finding a vaccine 
that can protect against menin gococcal type B disease.
rLP2086 is a vaccine for meningococcal type B disease. It is approved for use in 
adolescents and young adults in Europe and the United States.   It is given by injection 
into the arm. The purpose of this study was to learn more ab out how the rLP2086 
vaccine works .  Researchers wanted to know:
How many participants would have antibodies against meningococcus B at 
6,12, 18, 24, 36, and 48 months after receiving the ir last dose of vaccine?
How many participa nts would have antibodies against meningococcus B 
1month after receiving their last dose of vaccine, before receiving a booster 
vaccine, and at 1, 12, and 26 months after receiving the booster vaccine?  
To answer th esequestion s, researchers collected blood samples from the participants .  
The researchers looked for antibodies in the blood against 4 different strains of 
meningococcus B.  Antibodies are special proteins that can recognize and help kill 
germs.  These antibodies can protect people from getting sick if they ever d o come 
into contact with the meningococcus B germ.  
Researchers were also interested in learning more about the safety of the vaccine. 
They monitored for any medical problems the participants had after receiving the 
vaccine.

3WHAT HAPPENED DURING THE STUD Y?
Adolescents who participated in 3 previous studies with rLP2086 were invited to join 
this study.  In t his study ,the participants were monitored to find out if they would 
have antibodies against the meningococcus B germ . 
The study was divided into 2 stages.  Stage 1 lasted from month 6 to month 48 after 
the last vaccine was given.  Participants came to visits at the study center up to 6 times 
to have blood samples collected.   No vaccines were given during this stage.
The b ooster stage was optional, so only some of the adolescents participated in this 
stage.  A single booster dose of rLP2086 was given at study visit 7.  This stage of the 
study lasted up to 26 months after the booster dose was given .
The figure below shows wh at happened during the study.
The entire study took about 5 ½ years to complete, although participants may have 
completed the study sooner. Participants joined the study at 1 of 50locations in the 
Czech Republic, Denmark, Germany, Sweden, Finland ,and the United States .  It 
began 07 September 2012and ended 05January 2018.  For stage 1, a total of 360 girls 
090177e1913eb986\Approved\Approved On: 19-Jul-2019 06:17 (GMT)
4(52%) and 336 boy s(48%) participated.   For the booster stage, a total of 165 girls 
(55%) and 136 boy s(45%) participated.   All participants were b etween the ages of 
11and 20 when this study began.
Participants were supposed to come to the study center up to 11 times for visits, and 
some of the participants may have received a single dose of booster vaccine. Of the
698 participants who participated in stage 1 , 623 (89%) completed it. 75participants
(11%)did not finish stage 1 by their choice or because a doctor decided it was best for 
a participant to stop the study.
When the study ended in January 2018, the Sponsor began reviewing th e information 
collected.  The Sponsor then created a report of the results.  This is a summary of that 
report.
WHAT WERE THE RESULTS OF THE STUDY?
How  many participants had antibodies against 
meningococcus B at 6, 12, 18, 24, 36, and 48 months after 
receiving their last dose of vaccine?
For stage 1, the number of participants with antibodies against meningococcus B 
decreased during the first 12 months after the last dose of vaccine , then stayed about 
the same through month 48 :
At month 1, the percenta ge of participants with antibodies against 
meningococcus B ranged from 7 4% to 100%, depending on which strain was 
tested.
At month 12, the percentage of participants with antibodies against 
meningococcus B ranged from 17% to 76%, depending on which strain was 
tested.
At month 48, the percentage of participants with antibodies against 
meningococcus B ranged from 18% to 61%, depending on which strain was 
tested.

5How  many participants had antibodies against 
meningococcus B at 1 month after receiving their last dose of 
vaccine, before receiving a booster vaccine, and at 1, 12, and 
26 months after receiving the booster vaccine?
At month 1 after receiving the booster vaccine, the percentage of participants 
with antibodies against meningococcus B ranged from 93% to 100%, 
depending on which strain was tested.
At month 12 after receiving the booster vaccine, the percentage of participants 
with antibodies against meningococcus B ranged from 59% to 100%, 
depending on which strain was tested.
At month 26 after receiving the booster vaccine , the percentage of participants 
with antibodies agains t meningococcus B ranged from 58 % to 83%, depending 
on which strain was tested.
This does not mean that everyone in this study had these results.  Other studies may 
produce different results, as well.  These are just some of the main findings of the 
study, and more information may be available at the websites listed at the end of this 
summary.  
WHAT MEDICAL PROBLEMS DID 
PARTICIPANTS HAVE DURING THE STUDY?
The researchers recorded any medical problems the participants had during the 
booster stage of the study. Participants could have had medical problems for reasons 
not related to the study (for example, caused by an underlying disease or by chance).  
Or, m edical problems could also have been caused by a study treatment, or by 
another medicine the participant was taking.  Sometimes the cause of a medical 
problem is unknown.  By comparing medical problems across many treatment groups 
in many studies, doctors try to understand what the side effects of an experimental 
drug might be.

6292 out of 301 participants (97%) in the booster stage had at least 1 medical problem.  
No participants (0%) left the study because of medical problems.  The most common 
medical prob lems during the booster stage are listed below.

WERE THERE ANY SERIOUS MEDICAL 
PROBLEMS?
A medical problem is considered “serious” when it is life -threatening, needs hospital 
care, or causes lasting problems.  
5out of 301participants (2%) in the booster stage had at least 1 serious medical 
problem , which were not considered related to the vaccine .  No participants died 
during the study .
