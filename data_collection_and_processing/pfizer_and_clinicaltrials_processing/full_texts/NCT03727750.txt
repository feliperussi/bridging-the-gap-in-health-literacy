Why was this st udy done?
What is CD33 -positive acute myeloid leukemia ?
Acute myeloid leukemia (or “AML”) is a type of blood cancer . This cancer is caused 
by too many immature white blood cells being made in the bone marrow. This 
reduces the ability of the body to make normal blood cells such as white blood cells 
(that fight off infections), red blood cells (that deliver oxygen to muscles and organs), 
and platelets (that help blood clot).
In normal cells, CD33 is a protein that is involved in helping cells communicate and
connect/bond to things . They are also involved in cell growth. Cancer cells may grow 
more quickly. 
Participants in this study had CD33 -postive AML, which means that they had the 
CD33 protein on the surface of their cancer cells. Their CD33 -positive AML was 
either:
Relapsed: This means that the patient had a response to their most recent cancer 
treatment, but the cancer came back.
Or
Refractory: This means that the patient did not have any response to their most 
recent cancer treatment, or the disease got worse while receiving the most recent 
treatment.
What is gemtuzumab ozogamicin (MYLOTARG™) ?
Gemtuzumab ozogamicin (GO) (MYLOTARG™) is an antibody that attaches to 
myeloid cells (a type of cell in the bone marrow and blood ) that have the CD33
protein . Once attached to the cancer cells, the drug delivers a substance into the cells 
and causes the diseased cell to die.

At the time of this study GO is the only approved AML therapy that specifically 
targets the CD33 protein . 
In the United States ( US), GO is appro ved for treating adults and children 1 month 
and older who have been diagnosed with CD33 -positive AML for the first time . It is 
also approved for treating relapsed or refractory CD33 -positive AML in adults and 
children 2years and older . Participants in this study had relapsed or refractory 
CD33 -positive AML.
In the European Union , GO is approved (to be given in combination with some 
other anti-cancer medications) for treating participants 15 years and older, who have 
been diagnosed with CD33-positive AML for the first time and have not previously 
been treated for their AML. 
The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) asked the researchers to do some 
additional tests to s ee whether GO has an effect on the heart function (described in 
next secti on).
What was the purpose of this study?
Themain goal of this study was to see if taking GO has an effect on the heart 
function (specifically the “QT interval”) of pa rticipants with AML .
Inthis study, researchers used an electrocardiogram (ECG) machine , to measure heart 
function . The QT interval is a measurement made on the ECG that measures the 
electrical activity for part of the heart function .
The researchers wanted to see if there were any changes in the QT interval after 
taking GO , compared to before taking GO . Specifically, researchers wanted to see if 
GO causes “QT prolongation”. QT prolongation occurs when the heart takes longer 
to contract and relax. This can affect the heart rhythm (beating of the heart ) and can 
lead to l ife-threatening hea rt rhythm disorder .
To make sure the comparisons were accurate, researchers adjusted or “corrected” the 
QT interval using a special formula . This i sso QT interval values c ould be compared 
090177e199d3c470\Approved\Approved On: 31-Mar-2022 09:40 (GMT)
fordifferent heart rates. The corrected QT interval is called “QTc”. In this study, the 
corrected QTc values used to described results is called “QTcF ”.
Researchers wanted to know:
Did the participants have a change in the irheart function
(measured by QT change) after taking GO, compared to before 
taking GO?
What happened during the study?
How was the study done?
Researchers t ested GO on a group of study participants with CD33 -positive AML to
find out if study participants taking GO had a change in their heart function. 
This was an “open -label” study, which means that the researchers and the participants 
knew what study medication they were receiving. Apart from GO, participants also 
received their normal medications to relieve their cancer symptoms . Participants were 
also given medicines to help reduce symptoms such as fever and chills, known as 
“infusion reactions ”, before receiving GO.
Before being included in the study, participants were “screened” to see if they qualify 
to be in the study. During screening, a bone marrow or blood sampl es was collected 
to see if participants had CD33 on their cancer cells. 
Participants were given 3mg/m2of GOvia intravenous (IV) infusion (using a “drip”) 
on Days 1, 4 and 7 per cycle for 1or 2cycles . Infusion of the study medication took 
about 2hours on each day . Some participants received GOfor 1cycle, and others for 
2cycles, depending on what the research doctors felt was best, and how what side 
effects the participants were having due to receiving GO.
090177e199d3c470\Approved\Approved On: 31-Mar-2022 09:40 (GMT)
Participants returned to the study un it for tests and biological sample collection on 
Days 10, 15 and 21 of each cycle , and had a final end-of-treatment (EoT) visit, 
36days after the last dose of GO , or start of new/other anticancer treatment.
After the EoT visit ,participants were monitored every 12weeks for 12 months, either 
via phone call or by being asked to return to the study unit for assessments ,during a 
Follow -up Period.
Participants had regular ECGs to monitor changes in their heart .Participants also had 
other tests, and blood sam ples collected to monitor their safety, check the level of 
GO in their blood and how GO was processed by their body . Some participants also 
had urine samples collected. Participants were also asked about how well they were 
feeling, and about any other medi cations they were taking.
The schematic of the basic study plan is shown below.
Where did this study take place?
The Sponsor ran this study at 17locations in 6countries in Europe and North 
America .
When did this study take place?

Who participated in this study?
A total of 66 potential participants were screened to see if they qualify to be in the 
study. 
In total, 52 participants (51 adults and 1 teenager ) who had CD33 -positive AML that 
was either relapsed or refractory ,qualified to be in the study .Only results for the 
51adult participants are shown in this report. 
Participants included in the study also met specific criteria with regards to the status 
of their leukemia, their heart rate measurements (specifically, QT interval), and their
current and previous treatments for their cancer . 
A total of 31 men participated
A total of 20 women participated
All participants were between the ages of 22years and82years.
Of the 51 adult participants in the study , 50 participants received at least 1 dose of 
study medication . One participant did not receive any treatment.
Of the 50 participants who received study medication:
46of the 50 participants (92%) completed Cycle 1 treatment, and
9 of the 50 participants (18%) completed Cycle 2 treatment .
Two of the participants did not complete the ir assigned treatment due to medical 
problems . 
All 51participants (including the 1 participant who did not receive any study 
medication) entered the follow -up part of the study. Most of the participants (49 of 
090177e199d3c470\Approved\Approved On: 31-Mar-2022 09:40 (GMT)
the 51 participants [96%] ) did not complete the follow -up part of the study, due to the 
following reasons:
Participant passed away : 45of the 51 participants (88%)
Participant decided they did not want to be in the study anymore : 2 of the 
51participants (4%)
Researchers were unable to contact the participant: 1 of the 51 participant s(2%)
Other reason: 1 of the 51 participant s(2%)
How long did the study last?
Study participants were in the study for about 12 months . The entire study took 1year 
and 9 months to complete.
When the study ended in April 2021 , the Sponsor began reviewing the information 
collected . The Sponsor then created a report of the results . This is a summary of that 
report.
What were the results of the study?
Did the participants have a change in their heart function (measured 
by QT change) after taking GO, compared to before taking GO?
Only r esults for all adult participants are shown below. 
The study found that GO did cause changes in heart function, measured by QT 
change. None of the changes were of concern to researchers though .

Did the study medication cause QTc prolongation?
The researc hers did a comparison (“analysis”) of QTc interval values before taking 
GO and after taking GO using statistical tests. They used QTcF for the main 
comparison. 
Figure 1 shows the average changes in QTc from before the first dose of GO was 
given (“baseline ”) to different time points in Cycle 1 after GO was given. Time points 
assessed were Day1 (at 1, 2 and 4 hours), Day 4 (at 0 and 2 hours) and Day 7 (at 0, 2, 
4 and 6 hours). Bars above the line show increases in QTcF from baseline , and bars 
below the line show decreases in QTcF from baseline .
Researchers decided beforehand on a specific cut off value that would tell them if the 
change in QTc was significant or not. The study found that the largest possible 
difference in QTc values after taking GO calculated by researchers was below the cut 
off value. This means that QTc values after taking GO were acceptable compared to 
average QTc values at baseline, for the time points in this study. The researchers did 
not think that GO causes significant QTc pr olongation.
There were no participants with individual QTc changes from baseline or maximum 
QTc values that were of concern to researchers.

This does not mean that everyone in this study had these results. This is a summary of 
just some of the main results of this study. Other studies may have different results.
What medical problems did participants have during 
the study?
The re searchers recorded any medical problems the participants had during the study . 
Participants could have had medical problems for reasons not related to the study (for 
example, caused by an underlying disease or by chance) . Or, medical problems could 
also have been caused by a study treatment or by another medicine the participant was 
taking . Sometimes the cause of a medical problem is unknown . By comparing medical 
problems across many treatment groups in many studies, doctors try to understand 
what effects a study medication might have on a participant.-505101520

Forty -nine (49) out of 50participants (98%) in this study who received GO in the 
study had at least 1 medical problem. The most common medical probl ems –those 
reported by 10% or more of participants –are described below.
Below are instructions on how to read Table 1. 
Instructions for Understanding Table 1. 
The 1stcolumn of Table 1lists medical problems that were commonly 
reported during the study . All medical problems reported by more than 
10% of participants are listed.
The 2ndcolumn tells how many of the 50 participants taking the study 
medication reported each medical problem .Next to this number is the 
percentage of the 50 participants taking the study medication who 
reported the medical problem. 
Using these instructions, you can see that 20out of the 50participants 
(40%) taking the study medication had a medical problem of low white 
blood cells count with fever.
Some participants had medical problems related to their heart rate, but most were 
mild tomoderate . One participant had medical problems of ‘irregular heartbeat ’and 
‘rapid heartbeat ’that were considered severe . 
No participants had side effects related to the electrical activity of their heart, that 
were considered life -threatening or caused the death of the participant.

Did study participants have any serious medical 
problems?
A medical problem is considered “serious” when it is life -threatening, needs hospital 
care, or causes lasting problems.
A total of 34 out of 50 participants (68%) had serious medical problems .Serious 
medical problems that were reported for 2 or more participants are shown in Table 2.
Most of the serious medical problems were not considered by researchers to be 
related to GO. A total of 5 out of 50 participants (10%) had serious med ical problems 
that researchers thought might be related to GO. 
Low white blood cell counts with fever in 3 out of 50 participants (6%)
Low blood platelets in 1 out of 50 participants (2%)
Bacterial infection of the kidneys, bladder or urethra in 1 out of 50 participants 
(2%)
Blood vessel leakage in 1 out of 50 participants (2%)
