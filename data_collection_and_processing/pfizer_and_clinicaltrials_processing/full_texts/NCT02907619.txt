2WHY WAS THIS STUDY DONE?
Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a disease that damage smuscles, causing 
muscle weakness and loss of the ability to walk.  DMD is most common in boys.   
Domagrozumab isanexperimental medicine studied for DMD.  Domagrozumab has 
not been approved for use outside of research studies.
The main goal of this study was to learn more about the long-term safety of 
domagrozumab in boys with DMD. Researchers wanted to answer thisquestion : 
What medical problems did boys have during the study?
To ans wer this question, researchers looked at:
Medical problems that caused the boyto temporarily stop taking 
domagrozumab , or that caused the dose of domagrozumab to be lowered
How severe medical problems were, whether the medic al problems were 
related to taking domagrozumab, and whether boys needed to leave the study 
because of the medical problems
Lab test findings
Findings from p hysical examination, x -rays, andother tests
WHAT HAPPENED DURING THE STUDY?
Thisstudy included boys with DMD who participated in a previous study 
(Study B5161002) with domagrozumab.  Certain lab tests were done to make sure the 
boys were a good fit to join this study.

3The previous study (Study B5161002) included 3 treatment groups, and was done in 
2parts:
Group 1: 
Part 1: Domagrozumab starting at 5 milligrams per kilogram of weight 
(mg/kg), then increased to 20 mg/kg, then to 40 mg/kg
Part 2: Domagrozumab 40 mg/kg
Group 2: 
Part 1: Domagrozumab starting at 5 mg/kg, then increased to 20 mg/kg, t hen 
to 40 mg/kg
Part 2: Placebo
Group 3: 
Part 1: Placebo
Part 2: Domagrozumab starting at 5 mg/kg, then increased to 20 mg/kg, then 
to 40 mg/kg
A placebo looks just like the medicine, but doesn’t have any medicine in it.
This was an “open -label” study, which means that t he boys, their parents, and the 
researchers knew wh atmedicine and dose the boys received during the study. 
All boys in this study received domagrozumab at a dose of 40 mg/kg, given once per 
month. Domagrozumab wasgiven as an IV infusion, which means that a needle is 
placed in the vein and the study drug slowly drips into the vein.
When boys came to study visits, lab tests, x -rays, physical examinations , and other 
tests were done, and they were asked about any medi cal problems.
The figure on the following page shows what happened during this study.

4This study was planned to last up to 4 years.  However, the Sponsor decided to stop 
the study early in November 2018, because results from the previous study did not 
show that boys benefited from taking domagrozumab.
On average, boys were in the study for about 10 months, but the entire study lasted 
about 2 years .  The sponsor ran this study at 22locations in Canada, Italy, Japan, 
United Kingdom, and United States. It began 13October 2016and ended 
22November 2018.  All 59participants were boys between the ages of 7and 1 1.
Boys were tobe treated for up to 4 years .Of the 59boys who entered the study ,no
boys (0%) completed it.  55boys (93%) left the study when the Sponsor decided to 
stop it early. Additionally, 3 boys (5%) did not complete the study by their choic e or 
their parent’s choice, and 1 boy(2%) passed away for a reason not related to taking 
domagrozumab .
The Sponsor decided to stop the study early in November 2018, because results did 
not show that boys benefited from taking domagrozu mab.  After the study ended, the 
Sponsor then created a report of the results.  This is a summary of that report.

5WHAT MEDICAL PROBLEMS DID BOYS HAVE 
DURING THE STUDY?
The researchers recorded any medical problems the boys had during the study. Boys
could have had medical problems for reasons not related to the study (for example, 
caused by an underlying disease or by chance). Or, medical problems could also have 
been caused by a study treatment, or by another medicine the boywas taking. 
Sometimes the cause of a medical problem is unknown. By comparing medical 
problems across many treatment groups in many studies, doctors try to understand 
what the side effects of an experimental drug might be.
49 out of 59 boys (83%) in this study had at least 1 medical problem.  The most 
common medical problems are listed below.

Researchers also found that:
No boys in this study had medical problems that caused them to temporarily 
stop taking domagrozumab, or that caused the dose of domagrozumab to be 
lowered.
Most of the medical problems that happened during this study were considered 
to be mild in severity.  4 boys (7%) had medical problems that were considered 
to be severe.
6 boys (10%) had medical problems that were consid ered to be related to 
taking domagrozumab.  These medical problems were considered to be mild in 
severity.
1 boy(2%) left this study and passed away because of a medical problem.  This 
medical problem was not considered to be related to taking domagrozuma b.
Findings from lab studies, physical examination, x -rays, and other tests were 
used to learn more about the safety of domagrozumab.  In this study, no 
long-term safety issues were associated with taking domagrozumab.

7This does not mean that everyone in this study had these results.  These are just some 
of the main findings of the study, and more information may be available at the 
websites listed at the end of this summary.  
WERE THERE ANY SERIOUS MEDICAL 
PROBLEMS?

care, or causes lasting problems .  
5boys in this study (9%) had serious medical problems .  1 boypassed away for a 
reason not related to taking domagrozumab .The serious medical problems are listed
