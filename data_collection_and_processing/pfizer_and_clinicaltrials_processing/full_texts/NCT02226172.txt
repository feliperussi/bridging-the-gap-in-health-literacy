1CLINICAL TRIAL RESULTS
This summary reports the results of only one study.  Researchers must look at the 
results of many types of studies to understand if a study medicine works, how it 
works, and if it is safe to prescribe to patients.  The results of this study might be 
different than the results of other studies that the researchers review.

2WHY WAS THIS STUDY DONE?
What was the purpose of this study?
Myelofibrosis (MF) is a type of bone marrow cancer, characterized by uncontrolled 
production of abnormal, undifferentiated (stem cells) bone marrow cells leading to 
development of scar tissue in bone marrow.  This can change the body’s normal 
production of blood cells.  Clinical features include abnormal blood counts, enlarged 
spleen and/or liver, bleeding, thrombosis, and debilitating constitutional symptoms 
such as fatigue, weight loss, night sweats, fever, itchiness, bone pain, abdominal pain, 
and feeling “full” quicker when eating.
Glasdegib was the medicine tested in this study .  Glasdegib has been developed  to 
help reduce the proliferation and growth of abnormal bone marrow stem cells which 
may allow this cancer to grow.  Cancer stem cells are cells that self -regenerate and 
contrib ute to tumor growth.  The cancer stem cells can lead to tumor resistance to 
treatment, and spread of the tumor (metastasis).  It can also impact a patient’s overall 
survival.
This study was planned to be conducted in two parts: a “Lead -In” phase and a 
“Ran domized” phase.  All enrolled patients participated in the “Lead -In” phase of the 
study only.
The primary purpose of the ‘Lead -In’ phase of this study was to see if glasdegib (also 
known as PF -04449913), 100 mg daily dose, taken by mouth, was safe and tol erated in 
patients with MF who had previously taken ruxolitinib.  Ruxolitinib is a medicine, 
approved for use, to treat MF.  Ruxolitinib is sold under the name of Jakafi® or 
Jakavi®, depending on where you live.
In addition, to determine how their disease responded following 24 weeks of 
glasdegib study treatment, patients were evaluated to assess if their spleen volume had 
changed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computed tomography (CT).

3Who was eligible to take part in the study?
The study include d adult patients who:
Were diagnosed with MF;
Have previously been treated with ruxolitinib for MF, for which they had to 
stop due to not working well enough, or because it was causing medical 
problems; and
Have symptoms of MF
oSymptoms could include feelin g “full” quicker when eating, abdominal 
discomfort, itchiness, night sweats, bone pain, and shortness of breath.
These were just some of the main criteria patients needed to have to enter the study.  
There were other criteria to be in the study which are n ot listed here.
WHAT HAPPENED DURING THE STUDY?
First researchers checked to see if patients were eligible to enter the study at the 
Screening visit.  Next, eligible patients were enrolled into the “Lead In” phase of the 
study and started the study medicin e, glasdegib at the Baseline visit.   Over the course 
of the glasdegib treatment patients were evaluated for safety and remained on 
treatment for as long as they tolerated and derived clinical benefit from the treatment 
as determined by their study doctor.
The picture below shows what happened during the study.

4Although the safety of 
glasdegib was considered 
acceptable in “Lead -In” phase 
of the study, the study did not 
proceed into the “Randomized” 
phase because glasdegib did not 
appear to reduce the spleen 
volume.
While patients were only in the study for about 8 months, the entire study took 
4years to complete.  Some patients were in the study for longer than 8 months 
because they took the medicine as long as they were having clinical benefit from the 
study medicine.  
The sponsor ran this study at 10 locations in 2 countries, in Japan and the United 
States .  It began 06 October 2014 and ended 31 October 2018.  13 men and 8 women 
participated.  All patients were between the ages of 58 and 83 years.
Patients were supposed to be treated with glasdegib for at least 6 months. Of the 
21patients who started the study, 4 finished the 6 months of treatment with 
glasdegib.  17 patients did not finish the study.  1 patient died before finishing the 
study due to progression of their disease.  12 patients did not finish the study because 
they discontinued due to a medical problem they experienced.  4 patients left before

5the study was over by their choice or a doctor decided it was best for a patient to stop
the study.
When the study ended in October 2018, the Sponsor reviewed the information 
collected.  The Sponsor then created a report of the results. This is a summary of that 
report.

6WHAT WERE THE RESULTS OF THE STUDY?
Was taking glasdegib safe for patients with myelofibrosis?
Patients were given a variety of different tests to see how safe glasdegib was.  These 
included physical exams by doctors, ECGs (a test to see how well your heart is 
working), collection of information (such as medical problems the patient was 
experiencing during the study), vital signs, blood and urine tests, and imaging tests.  
See below picture for a summary of the tests ran during this study.
Based on the data collected from these tests, taking 100 mg of glasdegib daily pe r 
mouth was manageable for patients with MF.  Also, taking glasdegib for longer 
periods of time did not appear to increase medical problems experienced in  these 
patients.

7Did glasdegib help to decrease patient’s spleen volume?
MF causes patients to hav e enlarged spleens.  Researchers wanted to see if glasdegib 
could help reduce spleen volume.  
5 patients did experience some reduction in spleen volume at some point in this study.  
However, after 24 weeks of treatment, the average spleen volume increased.  6 out of 
21patients were checked for spleen volume at the 24 -week visit.  There was an 
average increase of about 9% after taking glasdegib for 24 weeks.

8Did glasdegib help to improve patient’s overall disease 
symptoms?
Patients took survey s at each of the study visits to record what their symptoms of MF 
were and the severity of their symptoms.  From this survey, researchers assigned them 
a total symptom score (TSS).  Researchers wanted to see if patient’s TSS improved 
after taking glasdegib .  Researchers also wanted to see how many patient’s TSS’ 
improved at least 50% after taking glasdegib at the Week 24 visit.  A summary of the 
results are shown in the below picture.
After 12 weeks of treatment with glasdegib:
8 out of 21 patients (or 38 %) had a 20% or better improvement in symptoms.
2 out of 21 patients (or 10%) had a 50% or better improvement in symptoms.
After 24 weeks of treatment with glasdegib:
4 out of 21 patients (or 19%) had a 20% or better improvement in symptoms.
1 out of the 2 1 patients (or 5%) had a 50% or better improvement in 
symptoms.
Researchers concluded that based on these results that glasdegib may help improve 
patient’s symptoms for patients with MF previously treated with ruxolitinib. This does 
not mean that everyone in this study had these results.  Other studies may produce 
different results, as well.  These are just some of the main findings of the study, and 
more information may be available at the websites listed at the end of this summary.

9WHAT MEDICAL PROBLEMS DID PATIENTS 
HAVE DURING THE STUDY?
The researchers recorded any medical problems the participants reported during the 
study.  Participants could have had medical problems for reasons not related to the 
study (for example, caused by an underlying disease or by chance).  Or, medical 
problems could also have been caused by a study treatment, or by another medicine 
the participant was taking.  Sometimes the cause of a medical problem is unknown.  
By comparing medical problems across many treatment gro ups in many studies, 
doctors try to understand what the side effects of an experimental drug might be.
All patients in this study had at least 1 non -serious medical problem.  A “non -serious” 
medical problem is one that is not life -threatening, or does not cause lasting medical 
problems or death.  A total of 12 patients (57%, or 12 out of 21 patients) left the 
study because of medical problems.  
The most commonly reported medical problems were changes in how things tasted, 
muscle spasms, and loss of hair.  The medical problems experienced by patients did 
not lead to any new safety concerns for glasdegib in patients with MF who had 
previously taken ruxolitinib.
The table below shows a list of the medical problems experienced by more than 5% 
of all patients (o r at least 2 out of the 21 patients who participated in the study).
