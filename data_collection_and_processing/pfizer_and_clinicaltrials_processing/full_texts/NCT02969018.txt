1CLINICAL TRIAL RESULTS
This summary reports the results of only one study.  Researchers must look at the 
results of many types of studies to understand if a study medicine works, how it 
works, and if it is safe to prescribe to patients.  The results of this study might be 
different than the results of other studies that the researchers review.

2WHY WAS THIS STUDY DONE?
Plaque psoriasis is a disease that can cause a red, scaly ra sh to form on the skin. The 
rash may be painful or itchy. Plaque psoriasis can also affect other parts of the body, 
such as the joints or nails.  These problems are because the immune system, whose 
job is to attack foreign invaders like viruses and other germs, mistakenly attacks the 
body instead.
There is no cure for plaque psoriasis at this time, but common treatments include 
medicines that may control pain, reduce inflammation, and help prevent the immune 
system from attacking the body. 
PF-06700841 is a medicine that is being studied as a possible treatment for moderate 
to severe plaque psoriasis.  PF -06700841 may help to stop the immune system from 
attacking the body, and reduce inflammation.  Because it is still being tested, 
PF-06700841 has not been approved for use in patients.
The main purpose of this study was to find out how PF -06700841 works to treat 
moderate to severe plaque psoriasis, compared to a placebo.  A placebo looks just like 
the medicine, but doesn’t have any medicine in it.
Resea rchers wanted to know: 
At week 12 of the study, did patients who took PF -06700841 have an 
improvement in psoriasis symptoms, compared to patients who took placebo? 
To answer this question, the researchers used a tool called the PASI (Psoriasis Area 
and S everity Index) to measure plaque psoriasis symptoms.  The PASI looks at the 
redness, thickness, and scaling of the rash, as well as how much of the body is covered 
by the rash.
WHAT HAPPENED DURING THE STUDY?
This study compared patients taking different d ose strengths of PF-06700841 to 
patients taking placebo, to find out if they would have an improvement in psoriasis 
symptoms . The study included adult patients with moderate to severe plaque

3psoriasis.  The patients and researchers did not know who took PF-06700841 and 
who took the placebo.  This is known as a “blinded” study.  Patients were assigned to 
each group by chance alone.  Putting people into groups by chance helps to make the 
groups easier to compare.
First, patients were checked by the study doctor to make sure they were a good fit to 
join the study.  This was known as the “screening period”, which could last up to 
6weeks.
During the first part of the treatment period, which lasted 4 weeks, patients received 
1of 3 possible treatments:
30 mg PF-06700841, taken once per day (“QD”)
60 mg PF -06700841, QD
Placebo, QD
During the second part of the treatment period, which lasted 8 weeks, patients were 
switched to 1 of 4 possible treatments:
10 mg PF-06700841, QD
30 mg PF-06700841, QD
100 mg PF-06700841, taken once per week (“QW”).  These patients also 
received a placebo medicine on the days that they did not take PF -06700841, so 
that the study would stay blinded.
Placebo, QD
The last part of the study was a follow -up period, which lasted for 8 weeks after the 
patients finished taking study treatment.
The figure on the following page shows what happened during this study.

4While patients were only in the study for up to 26 weeks, the entire study took more 
than 15 months to complete, because p atients joined the study at different times.  The 
sponsor ran this study at 34 locations in Canada, Poland, and the United States .  It 
began 01 December 2016 and ended 19 March 2018.  148 men (70%) and 64 women 
(30%) participated.  All patients were betwee n the ages of 18 and 75. 
Patients were to be treated for 12 weeks and complete the 8 -week follow -up period.  
Of the 212 patients who started the study, 164 finished the study.  A total of 
48patients left before the study was over by their choice , because they had a medical 
problem, or because a doctor decided it was best for a patient to stop the study.
When the study ended in March 2018, the Sponsor began reviewing the information 
collected.  The Sponsor then created a report of the results.  This is a summary of that 
report.

5WHAT WERE THE RESULTS OF THE STUDY?
At week 12 of the study, did patients who took PF -06700841 
have an improvement in psoriasis symptoms, compared to 
patients who took placebo?
On average, patients who took PF-06700841 in this study had a greater improvement 
in psoriasis symptoms, compared to those who only took placebo.  On average, 
patients who took the following treatments had a “statistically significant” 
improvement in psori asis symptoms, which means that the researchers decided the 
improvement in symptoms is not likely a result of chance:
Study Part 1 Study Part 2
60 mg PF -06700841, QD 30 mg PF -06700841, QD
60 mg PF -06700841, QD 100 mg PF -06700841, QW
30 mg PF-06700841, QD 30 mg PF -06700841, QD
30 mg PF -06700841, QD 10 mg PF -06700841, QD
30 mg PF -06700841, QD 100 mg PF -06700841, QW
On average, patients who took the following treatments did not have a “statistically 
significant” difference in their symptoms, compared to patients who took placebo.  
This means although these patients may have seen an improvement in their 
symptoms, the differences seen could have been due to chance.

This does not mean that everyone in this study had these results.  Other studies may 
produce different results, as well.  These are just some of the main findings of the

WHAT MEDICAL PROBLEMS DID PATIENTS 
HAVE DURING THE STUDY?
The researchers recorded any medical problems the patients had during the study. 
Patients could have had medical problems for reasons not related to the study (for 
example, caused by an underlying disease or by chance).  Or, medical problems could 
also have been caused by a study treatment, or by another medicine the patient was 
taking.  Sometimes the ca use of a medical problem is unknown.  By comparing 
medical problems across many treatment groups in many studies, doctors try to 
understand what the side effects of an experimental drug might be.
149 out of 212 (70%) patients in this study had at least 1 m edical problem.  A total of 
14(7%) patients stopped taking study treatment because of medical problems.   Nine 
(9)of these patients (4%) had medical problems that were considered related to study 
treatment, including 1 patient who became pregnant and the fetus had a condition in 
which the lip did not develop properly. 
The most common medical problems are listed below.

WERE THERE ANY SERIOUS MEDICAL 
PROBLEMS?
A medical problem is considered “serious” when it is life -threatening, needs hospital 
care, or causes lasting problems.  
A total of 5 out of 212 patients (2%) had serious medical problems.  These 5 patients 
received PF-06700841 during the study. Two ( 2)of the patients (1%) had serious 
medical problems that were determined to be related to study treatment. The serious 
medical problems are listed below.
