1CLINICAL TRIAL RESULTS
This summary reports the results of only one study.  Researchers must look at the 
results of many types of studies to understand if a study medicine works, how it 
works, and if it is safe to prescribe to patients.  The results of this study might be 
different than the results of other studies that the researchers review.

2WHY WAS THIS STUDY DONE?
Atopic dermatitis is a common skin condition that can cause many symptoms, such as 
itching, redness, and a rash that is scaling or oozing.  The symptoms can look 
different on different people.  Atopic dermat itis is also known as eczema.  There is no 
known cure for this condition. People with atopic dermatitis often have this 
condition for many years, and may have “flare ups”, when their symptoms worsen for 
a time.
Researchers are looking for treatments for atopic dermatitis.  Crisaborole is a 
medicine that is used to treat atopic dermatitis. It is applied to the skin as an 
ointment.  Crisaborole may improve symptoms of atopic dermatitis by decreasing 
inflammation i n the skin.  Inflammation is the body’s immune system response, which 
can lead to symptoms such as redness.
The main goal of this study was to learn more about how crisaborole works by taking 
skin samples to analyze for “biomarkers”, which are special subs tances in the skin 
related to inflammation.   Researchers wanted to answer these main questions: 
Did atopic dermatitis “biomarkers” change in areas of skin that were treated 
with crisaborole, compared to areas of skin that were treated with pla in 
ointment ?
Did symptoms of atopic dermatitis improve in areas of skin that were treated 
with crisaborole, compared to areas of skin that were treated with plain 
ointment?
WHAT HAPPENED DURING THE STUDY?
This study included patients who were treated with both crisabo role and plain 
ointment on 2 different areas of the skin.  The areas of skin were then compared to 
see if atopic dermatitis symptoms would improve in the areas that were treated with 
crisaborole.
The study included adult patients with atopic dermatitis.  To join the study, patients 
must have had at least 2 areas of atopic dermatitis that were 3 centimeters x 
3centimeters or larger, and at least 5 centimeters apart.  Symptoms must have started

3at least 6 months before the study began, and must have been st able for at least 
1month. 
Patients were screened by the study doctor to make sure they were able to join the 
study.  This was known as the “screening period”, which lasted up to 30 days.  
Patients then entered the “double -blind” treatment period, which lasted 15 days.  
Double -blind means that patients and doctors did not know which area of skin was 
treated with which medicine.  This was done to make sure that the trial results were 
not infl uenced in any way.   For each patient, 1 area of skin was treated with 
crisaborole, and 1 area of skin was treated with plain ointment. Patients came to the 
study center twice per day during this part of the study, so that they could receive 
treatment and be checked by the study doctor.
On day 15 of the study, samples of the treated skin were collected to be used for 
testing.  Patients then entered the “open -label” treatment period, which lasted another 
28 days until day 43 of the study.  During this part o f the study, patients stopped 
using the plain ointment and could use crisaborole to treat all areas of the skin 
affected by atopic dermatitis (except the scalp).  Open -label means that patients and 
doctors knew which medicine was being used.
Patients recei ved a follow -up phone call on day 71 to check for any medical problems.  
This was considered the end of the study.
The figure below shows what happened during this study.

4While patients were only in the study for 71 days, the entire study lasted about 
9months from start to finish .  The sponsor ran this study at 1 location in Canada.  It 
began 31 July 2017 and ended 4 May 2018 .  A total of 13 men (33%) and 27 women 
(68%) participated.  All patients were between the ages of 18 and 57. 
Patients were expe cted to complete a 15 -day double -blind treatment period followed 
by a 28 -day open -label treatment period.  Of the 40 patients who started the study, 
38(95%) completed the study. 2 patients (5%) did not finish the study because they 
had a medical problem t hat was not considered related to the study treatment. 
When the study ended in May 2018, the Sponsor began reviewing the information 
collected.  The Sponsor then created a report of the results.  This is a summary of that 
report. 
WHAT WERE THE RESULTS OF THE STUDY?
Did atopic dermatitis biomarkers change in areas of skin 
that were treated with crisaborole, compared to areas of skin 
that were treated with plain ointment?
To answer this question, the researchers measured 7 skin biomarkers known to play a 
role in atopic dermatitis.  They compared biomarkers from before patients started 
treatment and at day 15 of the study, after patients completed the double -blind 
treatment phase. 
On average, all 7 biomarkers were reduced more in areas of skin treated with 
crisaborole compared to areas of skin treated with plain ointment.  The researchers 
have decided that these results are not likely the result of chance.  Crisaborole may 
reduce inflammation in skin with atopic dermatitis.
Did symptoms of atopic dermatitis i mprove in areas of skin 
that were treated with crisaborole, compared to areas of skin 
that were treated with plain ointment?

5To answer this question, the researchers used a clinical tool to rate the severity of 
atopic dermatitis symptoms on a scale from 0 (no symptoms) to 12 points (most 
severe symptoms).  They compared the severity of symptoms from before patients 
started treat ment and at day 15 of the study, after patients completed the double -blind 
treatment phase.  
On day 15 of the study, areas of skin treated with crisaborole improved an average of 
4.5 points, and areas of skin treated with plain ointment improved an averag e of 
2.1points , on the scale from 0 to 12.  The researchers have decided that these results 
are not likely the result of chance.  Crisaborole may be an option for treating patients 
with atopic dermatitis.
The figure on the following page shows these study results.

6This does not mean that everyone in this study had these results.  Other studies may 
produce different results, as well.  These are just some of the main findings of the 
study, and more information may be available at the websites listed at the end of this 
summary.  
WHAT MEDICAL PROBLEMS DID PATIENTS 
HAVE DURING THE STUDY?
The researchers recorded any medical problems the patients had during the study. 
Patients could have had medical problems for reasons not related to the study (for 
example, c aused by an underlying disease or by chance).  Or, medical problems could 
also have been caused by a study treatment, or by another medicine the patient was 
taking.  Sometimes the cause of a medical problem is unknown.  By comparing 
medical problems across many treatment groups in many studies, doctors try to 
understand what the side effects of an experimental drug might be.
29 out of 40 (73%) patients in this study had at least 1 medical problem.  A total of 
2(5%) patients left the study because of medica l problems.  The most common 
medical problems are listed below.

No patients (0%) had serious medical problems.  No patients (0%) died during the 
study.
