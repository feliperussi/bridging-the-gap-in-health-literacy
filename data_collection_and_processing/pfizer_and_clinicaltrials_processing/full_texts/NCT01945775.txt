2WHY WAS THIS STUDY DONE?
Breast cancer is one of the most common causes of cancer deaths in women.  In 
2012, about 1.7 million women were diagnosed with breast cancer and over 
522,000 women died due to the disease.  Some people carry changes or “mutations” 
in their DNA in genes called breast cancer susceptibility (BRCA) genes 1 and 2, or 
“BRCA1” and “BRCA2”.  BRCA gene mutations can be inherited by a child from 
one of their parents (germline).  When a pe rson’s BRCA1 or BRCA2 genes contain 
mutations, it can cause breast cancer.  Researchers are looking for treatments for 
breast cancer patients with BRCA mutations that can help them have more time 
without their cancer getting worse. 
Talazoparib (Talzenna®)is a drug that inhibit s(stop s) the normal activity of certain 
proteins called “Poly (ADP -ribose) polymerases”, also called “PARPs”.  PARPs are 
proteins (made from genes which are part of DNA) that are found in all normal and 
cancer cells that are involve d in the repair of DNA.  PARPs are needed to repair 
mistakes that can happen in DNA when cells divide.  If the mistakes are not repaired, 
the cell will usually die and be replaced.  Cells with mistakes in their DNA (like cells 
with BRCA1 and BRCA2 gene mut ations) that do not die can become cancer cells.  
Clinical trials have shown that the use of talazoparib, as well as other PARP inhibitors, 
can reduce tumor size or delay the cancer getting worse, and slow tumor growth in 
some cancer patients with BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations.  Talazoparib is given in a 
capsule and is taken by mouth once daily at around the same time every day.   
Talazoparib is now approved in the United States, the European Union, and other 
countries for the treatment of patients with a certai n type of breast cancer that has 
spread beyond the original tumor (“advanced”) or has spread to other parts of the 
body (“metastatic”) and have an inherited BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene mutation.  This 
study was done to see if talazoparib treatment could help patie nts with advanced or 
metastatic breast cancer, and have inherited a BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene mutation, have 
more time without their cancer getting worse when compared to commonly used 
chemotherapies.  
Researchers also wanted to learn more about the safety of t alazoparib.  They 
monitored the patients for any medical problems that happened while they were in 
the study.

3WHAT HAPPENED DURING THE STUDY?
This study compared 2 groups of patients to find out if patients taking talazoparib had 
more time without their c ancer getting worse compared to patients taking other 
commonly used chemotherapies.  
The study included patients who:
Were at least 18 years old
Had breast cancer that was advanced or had spread to other parts of the body 
(also called “metastatic cancer”)
Inherited the BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene mutation
Did not have more than 3 chemotherapy treatments for their advanced cancer
Had previously taken at least 1 of the commonly used cancer chemotherapies
Had good organ function and adequate blood counts
This trial w as an open -label study.  This means that both the patient and the doctor 
knew whether the patient received talazoparib or chemotherapy.

4Patients joined the study at 1 of 145 locations in the US, Europe (Belgium, France, 
Germany, Ireland, Italy, Poland, S pain, UK, Israel, Russia, and Ukraine) ,Brazil, South 
Korea, Australia, and Taiwan .  It began o n 14 October 2013 and ended on 
05March 2021.  A total of 7 men and 424 women participated in this study.  All 
patients were between the ages of 24 and 88. Patients were to be treated until their 
doctor determined that their cancer was getting worse, the side effects were too 
severe, or until they chose to stop participation in the study.   All o f the 431 patients 
who started the study had stopped treatment by theend of the study, mostly due to 
the patient’s cancer getting worse, thepatient chose to stop, or a doctor decided it was 
best for a patient to stop their assigned treatment.
The Sponsor reviewed the study results in September 2017 , September 2019 , and 
March2021.  The Sponsor then created reports of theresults collected up to those 
time points.  This is a summary of those reports.

5WHAT WERE THE RESULTS OF THE STUDY?
Did taking talazoparib help patients in this study have more time 
without their cance r getting worse than those treated with 
chem otherapy?
Researchers measured the “median time” between starting the study and the patients’ 
cancer getting worse, or dying of any cause.  The median time was the time point 
where half (50%) of the patients taki ng talazoparib or chemotherapy had their cancer 
get worse, or they had passed away from any cause.  For patients taking talazoparib, 
the median number of months patients went without their cancer getting worse was 
about 9 months.  For patients taking chemo therapy, it was about 6 months.
WHAT MEDICAL PROBLEMS DID PATIENTS 
HAVE DURING THE STUDY?
The researchers recorded any medical problems the patients had during the study.  
Patients could have had medical problems for reasons not related to the study (fo r 
example, caused by an underlying disease or by chance).  Or, medical problems could 
also have been caused by a study treatment or by another medicine the patient was 
taking.  Sometimes the cause of a medical problem is unknown.  By comparing 
medical prob lems over time, doctors may be able to understand what the side effects 
of an experimental drug might be.

6A total of 405 out of 412 patients in this study who received at least 1 dose of study 
medication had at least 1 medical problem (282 out of 286 on talazoparib and 123 out 
of 126 on chemotherapy) .  Most medical problems were manageable by lowering the 
dose of talazoparib or chemotherapy medications.

WERE THER E ANY SERIOUS MEDICAL 
PROBLEMS?
A medical problem is considered “serious” when it is life -threatening, causes lasting 
problems, or needs hospital care.  
A total of 142patients out of 412 (34%,or approximately 1 out of 3 patients) had 
serious medical pro blems (103 out of 286 on talazoparib and 39 out of 126 on 
chemotherapy) .  Most of these problems were not thought to be related to the study 
drug.  A total of 320out of 412 patients who had received at least 1 dose of 
talazoparib or chemotherapy medicatio n died during the study (220 out of 2 86 on 
talazoparib and 100 out of 126 on chemotherapy ).  Most deaths were due to the 
patient’s cancer getting worse.  Two (2) serious medical problems that occurred in 
patients who died (veno -occlusive liver disease in apatient receiving talazoparib and 
sepsis in a patient receiving chemotherapy ) may have been related to study treatment.  
In addition, 2 patients who received talazoparib developed blood cancer (acute 
myeloid leukemia) after they finished participating in the study that may have been 
related to the study treatment.   These patients also received other cancer treatments 
which could have helped cause their acute myeloid leukemia .
