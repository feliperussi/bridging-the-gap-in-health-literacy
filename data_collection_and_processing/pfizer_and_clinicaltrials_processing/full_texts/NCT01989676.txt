1CLINICAL TRIAL RESULTS
This summary reports the results of only one study.  Researchers must look at the 
results of many types of studies to understand if a study medicine works, how it 
works, and if it is safe to prescribe to patients.  The results of this study might be 
different than the results of other studies that the researchers review .

2WHY WAS THIS STUDY DONE?
Some women with breast cancer have high levels of a certain protein receptor on the 
surface on their cancer cells.  This protein is called HER2 (human epidermal growth 
factor receptor 2).  A cell with too many HER2 rece ptors is stimulat ed to grow and 
multiply too fast and can become a cancer tumor .  When women with breast cancer 
have too much of this protein their cancer is called “HER2 -positive”.
Trastuzumab (Herceptin®)is an approved drug for the treatment of patients with 
HER2 -positive breast cancer.  PF -05280014 was the investigational drug in this study.  
An investigational drug is one that is not approved for sale.
Researchers think that PF-05280014 may work like Her ceptin in the body.  Herceptin
isan antibod y, which is a type of protein.  Herceptin bindsto the HER2 receptor on 
the surface of cells .  By attaching to the HER2 receptor, this medicine can block the 
signals that cause the cells to grow and multiply.  
Patients who were in this study received either PF -05280014 or Herceptin in 
combination with paclitaxel .  Paclitaxel is a standard chemotherapy treatment for 
breast cancer.  It was used in this study because it iscommonly given to patients by 
doctors for t he treatment of breast cancer.  
The main purpose of this study was to find out if PF -05280014 worked similarly to 
Herceptin in patients with breast cancer.  Researchers wanted to answer this question:
What percentage of patients who received PF-05280014 and paclitaxel had a 
reduction in tumor size, compared to pa tients who received Herceptin and 
paclitaxel ?
WHAT HAPPENED DURING THE STUDY?
This study compared 2groups of patients .  Researchers wanted to find out if 
PF-05280014 worked similarly to Herceptin in patients with breast cancer.   
This study included adult women who:

3Had HER2 -positive breast cancer
Had breast cancer that had spread to another part of the body
Had at least 1 breast cancer tumor that could be measured
The patients and researchers di d not know who received PF-05280014 and who 
received Herceptin .  This is known as a “ double -blind ed” study.   Researchers use 
“double -blinded” studies to make sure that the results of the study are not influenced 
in any way.  
First, patients were checked (screened) to make sure they met all the requirements to 
be in the study.  Then, p atients were put into 1 of 2 treatment groups by chance alone .  
This is known as a “randomized” study.  This is done to make the groups more 
similar for things like age and r ace.  Reducing differences between the groups makes 
the groups more even to compare.  Patients had a 50% chance (1 in 2 chances, like 
the flip of a coin) of getting either treatment.
For at least the first 33 weeks of the study, patients were treated with PF-05280014 or 
Herceptin every week.  Depending on how the patient was doing, t he treatments were
given in at least 6 “cycles”, with a new cycle starting every 4weeks.  Paclit axelwas 
given weekly for the first 3 weeks of each cycle.  After 33 weeks and t reatment with 
paclitaxel hadstopped, depending on how the patient was doing, the study doctor 
could change the PF -05280014 or Herceptin treatment schedule to every 3 weeks.   
After completing study treatment, p atients were followed by researchers to see ho w 
they did after taking study medicines .
Patients were expected to receive study treatment until their breast cancer worsened.  
The entire study took more than 6 years to complete.  The Sponsor ran this study at 
168locations in 25countries in North America, South America, Europe, and Asia .  It 
began 2 4February 2014 and ended 27 June 2020 .  All patients were women between 
the ages of 19 and 85 years .

4Thefigure below shows what ha ppened in the study.
A total of 707 patients joined the study, but 5 patients (1%) did not receive any study 
treatment. 451patients (64%) finished the study .  251patients (35%) left before the 
study was over by their choice , because a doctor decided it was best for a patient to 
stop the study , because they passed away, or because the Sponsor stopped the study .
When the study ended inJune 2020 , the Sponsor began reviewing the information 
collected.  The Sponsor then created a report of the results.  This is a summar y of that 
report .
WHAT WERE THE RESULTS OF THE STUDY?
What percentage of patients who received PF-05280014 and 
paclitaxel had a reduction in tumor size, compared to 
patients who received Herceptin and paclitaxel ?
Throughout the study, the researchers did i maging tests (such as MRI or CT scans) t o
see if tumors were changing in size.  At Week 33 of the study :
63% of patients who were randomized to receive PF -05280014 and paclitaxel 
(220 out of 352 patients) had a reduction in tumor size (tumor got smaller or
disappeared)

567% of patients who were randomized to receive Herceptin and paclitaxel (236 
out of 355 patients) had a reduction in tumor size (tumor got smaller or 
disappeared)
In this study, PF -05280014 worked similarly to Herceptin in patients with breas t 
cancer.  Based on these results, the researchers have concluded that the results are not 
likely the result of chance.
This does not mean that everyone in this study had these results.  Other studies may 
produce different results, as well.  These are just some of the main findings of the 
study, and more information may be available at the websites listed at the end of this 
summary .  
WHAT MEDICAL PROBLEMS DID PATIENTS
HAVE DURING THE STUDY?
The researchers recorded any medical problems the pa tients had dur ing the study.  
Patients could have had medical problems for reasons not related to the study (for 
example, caused by an underlying disease or by chance).  Or, medical problems could 
also have been caused by a study treatment or by another medicine the pa tientwas 
taking.  Sometimes the cause of a medical problem is unknown.  By comparing 
medical problems across many treatment groups in many studies, doctors try to 
understand what the side effects of an experimental drug might be .
685 out of 702 patients (98%) had at least 1 medical problem , including 344 out of 
349 patients (99%) in the PF-05280014 group and 341 out of 353 patients (97%) in 
the Herceptin group .  A total of 109 patients (16%) stopped study treatment due to 
medical problems, including 57 out of 349 patients (16%) in the PF-05280014 group 
and 52 out of 353 patients (15%) in the Herceptin group .  The most common medical 
problems are listed in the table below.
