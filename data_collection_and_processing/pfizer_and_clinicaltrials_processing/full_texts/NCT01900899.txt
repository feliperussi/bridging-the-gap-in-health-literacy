2WHY WAS THIS STUDY DONE?
Invasive m eningococcal disease is an illness whichmaycause a serious infection inthe 
blood, as well as swelling around the brain and spinal cord.  Meningococcal disease is 
more common in children than adults.  Children who get this illness are at risk for 
hearing loss and other disabilities.  However, invasive meningococcal disease may be 
prevented with a vaccine.  A vaccine is a type of medic inethat helps people fight off 
germs.
Meningococcal disease is caused by the meningococcus germ.  There are different 
types of this germ.  For example, meningococcal type Adisease is caused by the 
meningococcus Agerm.  MenACWY -TT(Nimenrix) is a vaccine approved in Europe 
for the prevention of meningococcal disease .This vaccine targets 4 common types of 
meningoc occus germ: types A, C, Y, and W -135.  It is given by injection into the 
muscle .  
The main purpose of this study was to learn more about the long -term effects of 
Nimenrix in healthy children, compared to another vaccine called Meningitec®.  
Meningitec is aimed at preventing only meningococcal diseases caused by the 
meningococcus C germ .  Researchers wanted to know:
Would children still have antibodies against meningococcus germ sat 
2,3, 4, 5, and 6 years after receiving a booster injection of either 
Nimenrix or Meningitec?
To answer this question, researchers collected blood samples from the children.  The 
researchers looked for antibodies in the blood against the 4 different types of 
meningococcus germ.  Antibodies are special proteins tha t can recognize and help kill 
germs.  These antibodies can protect children from getting sick if they ever do come 
into contact with meningococcus germs.  
WHAT HAPPENED DURING THE STUDY?
This study compared 2 groups of children to learn more abou t the long -term effects 
of MenACWY -TT. 
The sponsor asked children who participated in 2 previous studies on Nimenrix to

3join this study .All the children were healthy and had received 2 injections (primary 
injection plus booster injection) of Nimenrix orMeningitec during the previous 
studies.
The children did not receive any study vaccinations or other medicines during this 
study, since they had already received either Nimenrix or Meningitec during the 
previous studies .  Instead, the children were asked to come to up to 5 visits, each a 
year apart, at the study center.  During these visits, the researchers collected blood 
samples from the children.  The researchers looked for antibodies in the blood against 
the 4 differ ent types of meningococcus germ.
This was an “open label” study, which means that the children, their 
parents/guardians, and the researchers knew which vaccine the children received 
during the previous studies.
The figure below shows what happened during t his study.
Children were in this study for up to 4 years, and the entire study took a little more 
than 4 years to complete.  Children joined the study at 1 of 9locations in Finland .
The first child joined the study on 16July2013and the last child finished the study on 
08November 2017.  A total of 84 girls and 100boys joined the study .  The children 
were between 7 and 10 years old when the ybegan the study .
Children were supposed to come to up to 5 visits, each a year apart ,at the study 
center. Of the 184 children who joined the study, 174 (95%) completed it.  A total of 
10children (5%) did not finish the study b y their parent /guardian ’s choice.

4When the study ended in November 2017, the Sponsor began reviewing the 
information collected.  The Sponsor then created a report of the results. This is a 
summary of that report.
WHAT WERE THE RESULTS OF THE STUDY? 
Did children still have antibodies against meningococcus 
germ sat 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 years after receiving a booster 
injection of either Nimenrix or Meningitec?
At each of the study visits, the majority of children from the Meningitec group still 
had antibodies against the meningococc usC germ.  At each of the study v isits, the 
majority of children from the Nimenrix group still had antibodies against each of the 
4 types of meningococcus germ .  
The 2 chart sbelow show the percentage of children ineach group who still had a 
certain level of antibodies against meningoco ccus germs at 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 years after 
receiving a booster vaccination.   Recall that the Meningitec vaccine is aimed at 
preventing diseases caused by the meningococcus C germ only.

This does not mean that everyone in this study had these results, and individual 
results could be better or worse than the overall group.  Other studies may find 
different results.  These are just some of the main findings of the study, and more 
informatio n may be available at the websites listed at the end of this summary.  
WHAT MEDICAL PROBLEMS DID CHILDREN
HAVE DURING THE STUDY?
The researchers recorded medical problems the children had during the study that 
were related to the vaccine s given during the previous study , to study participation, or 
to meningococcal disease . Children could have had medical problems for reasons not 
related to the study (for example, caused by an underlying disease or by chance). Or, 
medical problems could have been caused b y a study treatment .Sometimes the cause 
of a medical problem is unknown. By comparing medical problems across many 
treatment groups in many studies, doctors try to understand what the side effects of 
an experimental drug might be .
Out of 184children inthis study , 1 child (less than 1%) had a non-serious medical 
problem (that means a medical problem that is not life -threatening, does not cause 
lasting problems, or does not need hospital care) .  This child was in the Nimenrix
group and had arthritis (swelling in the joints).  The study doctors determined that this 
medical problem was not related to the Nimenrix vaccine that the child had received 
during the previous studies .

6WERE THERE ANY SERIOUS MEDICAL 
PROBLEMS?
A medical pr oblem is considered “serious” when it is life -threatening, causes lasting 
problems, or needs hospital care.  
No children in this study had a serious medical problem.  No children passed away 
during the study.

Please remember that researchers look at the results of many studies to find out which 
medicines work best and are safest for patients .  Additional studies with Nimenrix are 
ongoing.
Again, thank  you for volunteering.
We do research to try to find the 
best ways to help patients, and you 
helped us to do that !
