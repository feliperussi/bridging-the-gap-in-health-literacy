Clinical Study Results
This summary reports the results of only one study.  Researchers must look at the 
results of many types of studies to understand if a study medicine works, how it 
works, and if it is safe to prescribe to patients.  The results of this study might be 
different than the results of other studies that the researchers review.
Sponsor:    Pfizer Inc.
Medicine Studied: Tanezumab
Protocol Number: A4091061
Dates of Study: 28 October 2015 to 25 June 2021
Title of this Study: A Study to Learn If Tanezumab Could Lessen 
Metastatic Bone Pain in Participants Who Were Taking 
Opioids
[A Phase 3 Randomized, Double -Blind, 
Placebo -Controlled, Multicenter Study of the 
Analgesic Efficacy and Safety of the Subcutaneous 
Administration of Tanezumab (PF -04383119) in

–Thank You –
If you participated in this study, Pfizer, the Sponsor, would like to thank you for your 
participation.
This summary will describe the study results.  If you have any questions about the study 
or the results, please contact the doctor or staff at your study site.Why was this study done?
What are “bone metastasis” and “metastatic bone pain”?
“Bone metastasis” happens when cancer has spread from its original site to a bone.  
Bone metastasis is the most common cause of cancer pain.
“Metastatic bone pain” happens when bone metastasis causes pain.  Metastatic bone 
pain is called MBP.
What is tanezumab?
Tanezumab is astudy medicine that has not been approved for use in patients.  
Researchers think it could help lessen MBP. Tanezumab was injected under the skin
using a needle .
What was the purpose of this study?
Researchers wanted to know:
Did tanezumab help participants lessen MBP?
MBP can last for a long time and has a negative impact on well -being. While there are 
treatments for cancer pain, good control of MBP remains a challenge .
Patients who have MBP may need to take “opioids.”   Opioids are a kind of medicine 
for pain relief .  They are given for pain that is rated as medium to wors t.  But, opioids 
alone may give poor control of MBP.
Researchers wanted to learn if tanezumab could lessen MBP in participants who were 
taking opioids.What happened during the study?
How was the study done?
At the start of the study , participants were taking an opioid daily for MBP .  When 
they began a study treatment ,they kept on taking opioids at the same time.
What were the study treatments?
Tanezumab 20 mg
Tanezumab 10 mg
“Placebo”
A placebo does not have any medicine in it, but it looks just like tanezumab .
The participants and researchers did not know who were given tanezumab and who 
were given the placebo.  This is known as a “blinded” study.  Participants were 
assigned to agroup by ch ance alone.
Tanezumab 20 mg group: 72 participants were given tanezumab 20 mg.
Tanezumab 10 mg group:   9 participants were given tanezumab 10 mg.
In the middle of study, t he sponsor removed the tanezumab 10 mg group.
Tanezumab 10/20 mg group:   1 participant was first given tanezumab 10 mg, 
but was later switched to tanezumab 20mg.
Placebo group: 74 participants were given placebo.
Researchers compared the results of participants taking tanezumab to the results of 
those taking a placebo.The figure below shows what happened during the study.

Lasted 24 weeks
Study doctors and staff :
checked the participants’ 
health and did tests to 
find out who could join 
the study.
made sure the opioid dose
helped to partly lessen 
MBP of participants .
check ed if participants 
could endure the side 
effect sof the opioid dose.Participants were given a
study treatment once every 
8weeks for a total of 3 times.
Study treatments:
Tanezumab 20 mg
Tanezumab 10 mg
PlaceboParticipants were 
nolonger taking a 
study treatment .
They had check -ups 
by phone calls and 
clinic visits.
Through outthe study :
Participants took an opioid daily for MBP.  They took opioids by mouth or as a skin 
patch. They kept a record of their pain scores and medicines taken in a diary.  They 
answered survey questions about their MBP .
Study doctors or staff checked the participa nts’ health.  They asked participants how 
they were feeling and what medicines they were taking.  They took X -rays of the 
participants’ hips, knees, and shoulders.
Where did this study take place?
The Sponsor ran this study at 48 study site s in 15 countries.  The countries were in 
Asia, Europe, South America ,and Australia .
When did this study take place?
It began 28 October 2015 and ended 25 June 2021.
Who took part in this study?
The study included adults who were at least 18 years old.  They all had cancer with 
bone metastasis.  The participants were taking an opioid every day to treat MBP.  
But,opioids gave them poor pain relief.
A total of 86men and 69women took part.
All par ticipants were between 30 and 86 years old.
Out of 156 participants who started the study :
1 participant left the study before starting any study treatment .
155 participants were given a study treatment .  Out of the 155 participants:
o65 participants finished the study.
o90 participants did not finish the study.  This was because of medical 
problems, death, or other reasons.   Most of the deaths were due to 
cancer that had gotten worse.
How long did the study last?
Participants were in the study for 48 w eeks.  The entire study too k 5 years and 
8months to complete.
When the study ended in June 2021, the Sponsor began reviewing the information 
collected.  The Sponsor then created a report of the results.  This is a summary of that 
report.What were the results of the study?
Did tanezumab help participants lessen MBP?
To find out, p articipants rated their MBP every day on a scale of 0 (no pain) to 
10(worst pain).  Then, researchers compared the pain scores before treatment started
and after 8weeks of treatment . Participants were given tanezumab or placebo as a 
study treatment .  They were given a study treatment while takin g anopioid at the 
same time .
The figure below shows the results.
Figure 2.  Did tanezumab help to lower the pain score 
after 8 weeks of treatment compared to placebo?
Participants who 
were given 
tanezumab 20 mg 
(blue bar) had a 
greater decrease in 
pain score than those 
who were given 
placebo (grey bar).
Researchers reviewed the difference in the results between the tanezumab and 
place bo groups.  They found that tanezumab may help lessen MBP , and t hese results 
were not likely due to chance.
This does not mean that everyone in this stu dy had these resu lts. These results are the 
average of all participants.  A study participant may have had a greater or lower 
decrease in pain when taking study treatment . Similar studies may have different 
results than the results of this study .
What medical problems di d participants have during 
the study?
The researchers recorded any medical problems the participants had during the study.  
Participants could have had medical problems for reasons not related to the study (for 
example, caused by an underlying disease or by chance).  Or, medical problems could
also have been caused by a study treatment or by another medicine the participant was 
taking.  Sometimes, the cause of a medical problem is unknown.  By comparing 
medical problems across many treatment groups in many studies, doctors try to 
understand wha t effects a study medicine might have on a participant.
While being given a study treatme nt, 112out of 155 ( 72%) participants had at least 
1medical problem.

Did study participants have any serious medical

A medical problem is considered “serious” when it is life-threatening, needs hospital 
care, or causes lasting problems.
In thestudy, 70 out of 155 (45%) participants had serious medical problems.The table below shows the most common serious medical problems seen in 2 or more
