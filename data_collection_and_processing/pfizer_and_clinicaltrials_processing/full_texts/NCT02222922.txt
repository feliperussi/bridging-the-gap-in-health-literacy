2WHY WAS THIS STUDY DONE?
Chemotherapy is often used to treat cancer, but not all patients’ cancer gets better 
with treatment.  The drugs used for chemot herapy can kill healthy cells in a patient’s 
body along with the cancer cells, which can cause serious medical problems.  
Researchers are looking for new ways to treat cancer by directing chemotherapy drugs 
to cancer cells while leaving healthy cells alone .
PF-06647020 is a new investigational drug being studied to treat patients with cancer.  
An investigational drug is one that is currently not approved for sale in this country.  
PF-06647020 is a type of medicine called an “antibody -drug conjugate”.  An an tibody -
drug conjugate is made up of an antibody with a toxic agent chemically attached to it.  
Antibodies are special proteins made by the immune system that recognize and stick 
to specific proteins on the surface of germs or cells.  The antibody part of 
PF-06647020 recognizes a protein called PTK7, which is found in larger amounts on 
certain cancer cells when compared to healthy tissue.  Researchers think that 
PF-06647020 will deliver the toxic agent directly to cancer cells, slowing their growth 
and causi ng the cells to die.  
The main purpose of this Phase 1 study was to learn more about the safety of 
PF06647020, and to find the best dose of PF -06647020 to use to treat cancer in 
Phase 2 trials.  To do this, the researchers asked,
What medical problems did patients have while taking PF -06647020?
What dose -limiting toxicities, or “DLTs”, did patients have when taking 
PF-06647020?
DLTs are certain medical problems caused by taking PF -06647020 which 
require the patient to lower the dose or stop taking the m edicine temporarily or 
permanently.
The researchers also wanted to know if any of the patients’ cancer got better during 
the study.  To do this, they measured many things, including the “Clinical Response 
Rate”.  This was the percentage of patients whose c ancer stayed the same or got 
better during 6 or more cycles of treatment.

3WHAT HAPPENED DURING THE STUDY?
In the beginning of the study, patients were treated with PF -06647020 once every 
3weeks (or the “Q3W regimen”).  Later on in the study, patients were treated with 
PF-06647020 once every 2 weeks (or the “Q2W regimen”).  This was an “open -label” 
study, which means that the patients and doctors knew what the patients were being 
treated with.
The study included patients ≥18 years old who met the followi ng conditions:
For all study patients :
Had adequate kidney, liver, and bone marrow function
For the Q3W regimen:
Part 1: Patients with solid tumor(s) whose cancer was advanced/metastatic 
(spread to other parts of the body).  The patient’s cancer either did not respond 
to standard therapy, or there was no standard therapy available for their cancer.
Part 2: Patients with one of the following types of cancer:
1.Ovarian cancer (or “OVCA”)
2.A type of lung cancer called non -small cell lung cancer (or “NSCLC”), 
whos e cancer made medium to high amounts of the protein PTK7
3.A type of breast cancer called triple negative breast cancer (or “TNBC”), 
whose cancer made medium -high to high amounts of the protein PTK7
Able to walk around, take care of themselves, and do light house work or office 
work. 
For the Q2W regimen:
Patients with ovarian cancer (OVCA) that did not respond well to 
platinum -based chemotherapy, and who had received 2 or fewer regimens of 
systemic a nti-cancer therapy (meaning that medicines were taken by mouth or 
intravenously [IV])
Patients with NSCLC whose cancer had gotten worse after treatment, who had 
received 3 or fewer regimens of systemic anti -cancer therapy, and whose cancer 
made medium to h igh amounts of the protein PTK7.

5While patients were treated for up to 30 months, the entire study took 5 years to 
complete.  The Sponsor ran this study at 10 locations in Spain and the United States 
of America.  It began 17 October 2014 and ended 05 November 2019.  A total of 22 
men and 126 women participated in the study.  All patients were between the ages of 
31 and 80. 
Patients were to be treated until their cancer got worse, their general health got worse, 
they had too many medical problems, the patient wanted to stop, or until the p atient 
had passed away.  A total of 67 of the 113 patients (59%) who started the Q3W 
regimen finished the study.  A total of 13 of the 25 patients (52%) who started the 
Q2W regimen finished the study.  Forty six (46) patients in the Q3W regimen part 
and 12 patients in the Q2W regimen part of the study stopped taking the study 
medicine, mostly due to their cancer getting worse.  Thirteen (13) patients who started 
the Q3W regimen and 2 patients who started the Q2W regimen passed away during 
the study. Thirty three (33) patients who started the Q3W regimen and 10 patients 
who started the Q2W regimen left before the study was over by their choice or a 
doctor decided it was best for a patient to stop being in the study. 
When the study ended in November 2019, th e Sponsor began reviewing the 
information collected.  The Sponsor then created a report of the results.  This is a 
summary of that report.

6WHAT WERE THE RESULTS OF THE STUDY?
What dose -limiting toxicities (DLT) were reported when taking 
PF-06647020?
During the first part of the Q3W regimen and the Q2W regimen, the researchers 
wanted to find the correct dose of PF -06647020 for treating patients with cancer.  To 
find the correct dose, the researchers needed to know how many patients in each dose 
group h ad a DLT during their first 21 -day treatment cycle (Q3W) or 14 -day treatment 
cycle (Q2W).
Two (2) out of 31 patients (6%) enrolled in the Q3W regimen dose -escalation period 
and 3 out of 25 patients (12%) in the Q2W regimen dose -escalation period had a 
DLT.   Since the 2 patients with DLT in the Q3W regimen were treated with 
3.7mg/kg and 2 of 3 patients with DLT in the Q2W regimen were treated with 
3.2mg/kg, the researchers decided that the dose of 2.8 mg/kg PF -06647020 was the 
best dose to use to treat can cer.
What percentage of patients had their cancer stay the same or get 
better?
To do this, the researchers measured the “Clinical Response Rate” for the patients 
treated every 3 weeks (Q3W) and every 2 weeks (Q2W).  The Clinical Response Rate 
was the perce ntage of patients in the study whose cancer stayed the same or got better 
during 6 or more cycles of treatment.  
For patients treated Q3W, 40% of patients with lung cancer (NSCLC), 41% of 
patients with ovarian cancer, and 38% of patients with breast cance r (TNBC) had 
their cancer stay the same or get better when treated with PF -06647020.  For patients 
treated Q2W, 33% of patients with lung cancer (NSCLC) and 37% of patients with 
ovarian cancer had their cancer stay the same or get better when treated with 
PF-06647020.

7This study was not designed to test if one medicine was better than another, so the 
results could be due to chance.  This does not mean that everyone in this study had 
these results.  Other studies may produce different results, as well.  Th ese are just 
some of the main findings of the study, and more information may be available at the 
websites listed at the end of this summary.  
WHAT MEDICAL PROBLEMS DID 
PARTICIPANTS HAVE DURING THE STUDY?
The researchers recorded any medical problems the participants had during the study.  
Participants could have had medical problems for reasons not related to the study (for 
example, caused by an underlying disease or by chance).  Or, medical problems could 
also have been caused by a study treatment or by another medicine the participant was 
taking.  Sometimes the cause of a medical problem is unknown.  By comparing 
medical problems across many treatment groups in many studies, doctors try to 
understand what the side effects of an experimental drug might be .

8All of the patients in this study had at least 1 medical problem.  A total of 11 patients 
treated with the Q3W regimen and 1 patient treated with the Q2W regimen stopped 
taking the study medication because of medical problems.  The most common 
medical pr oblems are listed below.

9WERE THERE ANY SERIOUS MEDICAL 
PROBLEMS?
A medical problem is considered “serious” when it is life -threatening, needs hospital 
care, or causes lasting problems.  
Thirty six (36) out of 112 patients (32%) who were treated with the Q3W regimen had 
serious medical problems.  Twelve (12) out of 25 p atients (48%) who were treated 
with the Q2W regimen had serious medical problems.  A total of 21 patients passed 
away during the study, mostly due to their cancer getting worse.  The most common 
serious medical problems reported during the study are shown in the table below.
