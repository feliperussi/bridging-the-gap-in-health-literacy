Why was this study done?
What is Streptococcus pneumoniae ?
Streptococcus pneumoniae is a bacteria that can cause serious diseases, including infections 
of the lung (pneumonia), brain lining (meningitis), blood (bacteremia), or ear (otitis).
These infections may be very serious in young children and older adults. Streptococcus 
pneumoniae is also known as S pneumoniae . There are about 100 types of S pneumoniae .
What is the c7vPnC vaccine?
This study is about a vaccine called the “complementary 7 -valent pneumococcal 
conjugate vaccine”, or c7vPnC. A vaccine is used to help prevent infection by helping 
the body to fight off germs. c7vPnC may help to prevent infections caused by 
Spneumoniae . It is called "7 -valent" because it has the potential to prevent 7 common 
types of S pneumoniae . 
It is referred to as "complementary" as it is expected be used with Prevnar 13®, a 
vaccine approved in the United States that is made up of components to prevent 
disease caused by 13 types of S pneumoniae . 
When used together ,c7vPnC and Prevnar 13 could have the potential to prevent 
disease caused by 20 different types of S pneumon iae. 
c7vPnC is an investigational vaccine, which means that it has not been approved for 
general use and it is not yet known if it will protect against disease caused by 
Spneumoniae .
What was the purpose of this study?
The main purpose of this study was to learn about the safety of c7vPnC in healthy 
infants, when given with or separate lyfrom Prevnar 13.

Researchers wanted to know:
How many of the infants in the study:
oHad redness, swelling, or pain at the injection site within 7 days of each 
vaccination?
oHad fever, low appetite, sleepiness, or irritability within 7 days after each 
vaccination? 
oHad medical problems from Dose 1 to 1 month after Dose 3, and from 
Dose 4 or the supplemental dose to 1 month after?
oHad serious medical problems or a ny newly diagnosed chronic medical 
problems during the study?
What happened during the study?
How was the study done?
Researchers studied c7vPnC in a group of healthy infants to find out if infants had 
any health problems when given c7vPnC with or separately from Prevnar 13:
When given both c7vPnC and Prevnar 13 at 2, 4, 6, and 12 months of age
When given Prevnar 13 at 2, 4, 6, and 12 months of age, and c7vPnC at 3, 5, 7, 
and 13 months of age (every other month from Prevnar 13)
Researchers then compared the results of infants getting both c7vPnC and Prevnar 13 
(given either together or separately) at 2, 4, 6, and 12 months of age to the results of 
infants getting Prevnar 13 at 2, 4, 6, and 12 months of age and a supplemental dose of 
c7vPnC at 13 months of age. In this study, Prevnar 13 was used for comparison 
because it is an approved and recommended vaccine for use in infants for preventing 
Spneumoniae diseases. It was given to all infants in the study.
The families of the infants and the researchers knew which infants were given c7vPnC 
at the same time as Prevnar 13, every other month (separately) from Prevnar 13, or as 
a supplemental dose after the 4 doses of Prevnar 13. This is known as an “open label”

study. Infants were assigned to each group by chance alone. All infants had an equal 
chance of being assigned to each group.
Infants were expected to participate in 6 to 10 study visits, depending on which group 
they were in. At the visits, blood samples were collected, vacc ines were given, and 
infants were checked for any medical problems. Families were also contacted over the 
phone about 6 months after the last vaccine, to check on the infant’s health.
Infants in this study also received a Pediarix vaccine (an infant diphth eria, tetanus, 
pertussis, hepatitis B, poliovirus containing vaccine recommended by the American 
Academy of Pediatrics) with the first 3 vaccinations. They may have also received 
other recommended vaccines at the visits or at other times while they were en rolled in 
the study, which were not part of the study.
The figure below shows what happened during the study.

Where did this study take place?
The Sponsor ran this study at 39 locations in the United States.
When did this study take place?
It began 01 June 2018 and ended 05 November 2020.
Who participated in this study?
Infants were checked (screened) by the study doctors to make sure they were a good 
fit for the study. 
This study included infants who:
Were full term when they were born (at least 36 weeks into the pregnancy)
Were about 2 months old when they joined the study
Were considered to be healthy or with stable chronic disease by the study 
doctors
Did not have a disease or take medicine that would be associated with a 
weakened immune system
Had never received any vaccine for S pneumoniae
565infants joined this study, but 2 study sites were removed from participati onin the 
study, leaving 512 infants remaining.  Of these a total of 484 infants received at least 
1vaccine dose during the study :
A total of 244 boys were vaccinated
A total of 2 40girls were vaccinated
All infants were between the ages of 43 and 126 days at the start of the study. 
Out of the 512infants in thestudy :
424 infants (83%) received Dose 3 of c7vPnC, and 376 infants (73%) 
completed their 1 -month visit after Dose 3 .
89 infants (17%) left the study before the ir1-month visit after Dose 3 , by their 
family’s choice ,because a doctor decided it was best for the infant to stop 
being in the study , or the sponsor no longer re quired the visit .
090177e19737c613\Approved\Approved On: 07-Jun-2021 03:27 (GMT)
296 infants (58%) received Dose 4 and 238 infants (47%) completed their 
1-month visit after Dose 4. 37 infants (7%) left the study after Dose 4 but 
before their 1 -month visit after Dose 4 .
88 infants ( 18%) received the supplemental dose a nd 66 infants ( 13%) 
completed their supplemental dose 1 -month visit. 15 infants ( 3%) left the study 
after Dose 4 but before their supplemental dose 1 -month visit.
Overall, 389 infants (76%) completed the 6 -month follow -up phone visit, and 
276 infants (54%) completed all study visits.
How long did the study last?
Infants were in the study for up to 17 months. The entire study took a little more than 
2 years to complete.
When the study ended in 05 November 2020, the Sponsor began reviewing the 
information collected. The Sponsor then created a report of the results.  This is a 
summary of that report.
What were the results of the study?
How many infants had redness, swelling, or pain at the injection site 
within 7 days of each vaccination? 
The graph below shows the percentage of infants in each vaccine group with redness, 
swelling, or pain at the injection site within 7days after each vaccination .Infants in 
Group 2 had lower rates of  redness, swelling, or pain at the injection site than infants 
in Groups 1and 3. Infants in Groups 1 and 3 received other infant vaccines at the same 
time that they received Doses 1 to 4, but infants in Group 2 did not.

This does not mean that everyone in this study had these results. These are just some 
of the main findings of this study. Other studies may have different results. 
The researchers also examined what medical problems the infants experienced during 
the study. This information is provided in the next section.
What medical problems did infants have during the 
study?
The researchers recorded any medical problems the infants had during the study.  
Infants could have had medical problems for reasons not related to the study (for 
example, caused by an underlying disease or by chance). Or, medical problems could 
also have been caused by a study vaccin e or by another medicine the infant was 
taking. Sometimes the cause of a medical problem is unknown. By comparing medical 
problems across vaccine groups in many studies, doctors try to understand what 
effects a study vaccine might have on an infant.
In this study, by comparing infants who got the study vaccine (c7vPnC) to infants 
who got only Prevnar 13, researchers can understand if the safety of taking both 
090177e19737c613\Approved\Approved On: 07-Jun-2021 03:27 (GMT)
c7vPnC and Prevnar 13 at the same time or taking c7vPnC every other month from 
Prevnar 13 is sim ilar to the safety of taking Prevnar 13 alone.  There was not a similar
comparison group for the infants who received the supplemental dose.
How many infants had medical problems from Dose 1 to 1 month 
after Dose 3, and from Dose 4 or the supplemental dose to 1 month 
after?
During the time period from Dose 1 to 1 month after Dose 3, the following 
percentage of infants had medical problems:
58% of infants (99 out of 171) in Group 1 who received c7vPnC at the same 
time as Prevnar 13
65% of infants (96 out of 147) who received c7vPnC every other month from 
Prevnar 13
57% of infants (94 out of 166) who received Prevnar 13 only  
During the time period from Dose 4 to 1 month after Dose 4 , the following 
percentage of infants had medical problems:
24% o f infants (26 out of 110) in Group 1 who received c7vPnC at the same 
time as Prevnar 13
15% of infants (13 out of 85) in Group 2 who received Dose 4 of c7vPnC 
1month after Prevnar 13
26% of infants (26 out of 101) in Group 3 who received Prevnar 13 only
During the time period from the supplemental dose to 1 month after the 
supplemental dose (Group 3 only) , 18% of infants (16 out of 88) had medical 
problems.

The most common medical problems –those reported by at least 5% of infants –are 
described below in Table 1 and Table 2.
Below are instructions on how to read Tables 1 -2. 
Instructions for Understanding Tables 1 -2. 
The 1stcolumn of the tables lists medical problems that were 
commonly reported during the study. All medical problems reported 
by more than 5% of infants are listed in Table 1 and Table 2.
The 2ndcolumn tells how many of the infants in Group 1 (infants 
getting both c7vPnC and Prevnar 13 at the same time) reported each 
medical problem. Next to this number is the percentage of the infants 
in Group 1 who reported the medical problem. 
The 3rdcolumn tells how many of the infants in Group 2 (infants 
getting c7vPnC e very other month from Prevnar 13) reported each 
medical problem. Next to this number is the percentage of the infants 
in Group 2 who reported the medical problem.
The 4thcolumn tells how many of the infants in Group 3 (infants 
getting a supplemental dose of c7vPnC after all 4 doses of Prevnar 13) 
reported each medical problem. Next to this number is the percentage 
of the infants in Group 3 who reported the medical problem.
Example: Using these instructions, in Table 1 you can see that 7 out of 
the 171 (4%) infants in Group 1 reported constipation between Dose 1 
and 1 month after Dose 3. A total of 8 out of the 147 (5%) infants in 
Group 2 and 2 out of the 166 (1%) infants in Group 3 reported 
constipation between Dose 1 and 1 month after Dose 3.

Did study infants have any serious medical problems?
A medical problem is considered “serious” when it is life-threatening, needs hospi tal 
care, or causes lasting problems.
How many infants had serious medical problems or newly diagnosed 
chronic medical problems during the study?
4%of infants (20 out of 484) who received study vaccines had serious medical 
problems , including 4%of infants (7 out of 171) in Group 1, 3%of infants (4 out of 
147) in Group 2 , and 5% of infants (9 out of 166) in Group 3 . Additionally, one infant 
(less than 1%) from Group 2 who did not receive any doses of c7vPnC had a serious 
medical problem. Serious medical problems reported in more than 1% of infant sduring 
the study included: 
Bronchiolitis (a viral infection affecting the smaller airways), occurred in1% of 
infants (2 out of 171 )in Group 1, 1% of infants ( 1 out of 147 )in Group 2, and 
2% of infants ( 3out of 166 ) in Group 3.  
Pneumonia caused by a virus occurred in1% of infants (2 out of 166)in Group 3 
and no infants in Group 1 or Group 2.

6%of infants (30 out of 484) had newly diagnosed chronic medical problems during 
the study , includi ng 8% of infants (13 out of 171) in Group 1, 3% of infants (5 out of 
147) in Group 2, and 7% of infants (12 out of 166) in Group 3 .   
Researchers do not believe any of theseserious medical problems or newly diagnosed 
chronic medical problems were related to study vaccinations .No infants died during 
this study.
