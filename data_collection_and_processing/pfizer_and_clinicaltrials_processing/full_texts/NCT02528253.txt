1CLINICAL TRIAL RESULTS
This summary reports the results of only one study.  Researchers must look at the 
results of many types of studies to understand if a study medicine works, how it 
works, and if it is safe to prescribe to patients.  The results of this study might be 
differ ent than the results of other studies that the researchers review.

2WHY WAS THIS STUDY DONE?
Chronic low back pain is pain in the lower back that lasts for 3 months for more.  
Doctors can prescribe medicines to manage thispain, but t hese medicines may not 
work well for all patients, so researchers are looking for additional treatment options.   
Tanezumab was evaluated in patients with chronic low back pain .  Tanezumab isnot 
approved for use in patients.
The main purpose of this study was to learn more about how tanezumab works to 
treat chronic low back pain symptom s.  The researchers wanted to answer this 
question:
Did patients who received tanezumab have an improvement in chronic low 
back pain symptoms ,compared to patients who received placebo?
A placebo does not have any medicine in it, but looks just like the medicine.   
WHAT HAPPENED DURING THE STUDY?
This study compared 4groups of patients to find out if patients taking tanezumab 
would have an improvement in chronic low back pain symptoms .  To answer the 
research question, the researcher s asked patients to rate their lower back pain each 
day, on a scale of 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst possible pain) .
The study included adult patients with chronic lower back pain that has been going on 
at least 3 months , who did not get adequate pain relief from certain other pain 
medicines .  These patients had a back pain rating of 5 or more , ona scale from 0 
to10,at the beginning of the study.
First, p atients were screened by the study doctor to make sure they were appropriate
to join the study.  This w as known as the “ screening pe riod”, which lasted up to 
37days.  During this time, X -rays of the knees, hip joints ,and shoulder joints were 
taken , and lower back pain was assessed.
The next part of the study was the “treatment period” , which lasted up to 56weeks.

3The treatments used in this study included:
Tanezumab 5 mg, given as an injection under the skin every 8 weeks
Tanezumab 10 mg, given as an injection under the skin every 8 weeks
A placebo that looks like tanezumab, given as an injection under the skin every 
8 weeks
A medicine called tramadol that is used to treat chronic lower back pain, given 
as a pill by mouth e very day
A placebo pill that looks like the tramadol pill, taken by mouth e very day
Patients were assigned to 1 of 4treatment groups.  Patients were assigned to each 
group by chance alone.  Putting people into groups by chance helps make the groups 
more similar so they can be compared. 
Each group received the following treatments :  
Group 1: Placebo injection + placeb o pillfor the first 16 weeks.  After 
16weeks, patients were switched to tanezumab 5 mg or 10 mg injections ,
+placebo pill
Group 2: Tanezumab 5 mg injection + placebo pill
Group 3:  Tanezumab 10 mg injection + placebo pill
Group 4: Tramadol pill+ placebo injection
The patients and researchers did not know who took the tanezumab injection or the 
placebo injection and who took the tramadol pill or the placebo pill,since these
treatment slooked the same .  This is known as a “blinded” study.  
At study visits in the clinic, starting at the screening visit, the patients completed 
questionnaires about their low back pain .They also let the staff know about illnesses 
and discomforts, and had assessments (like physical exam, blood pressure, and more) 
done b y the study doctors and other qualified personnel.
During the stud y visits for week 16 and week 32 , the study doctor assessed whether 
the patients should continue in the study, based on their low back pain ratings.  To 
continue in the study, patients shoul d have at least 30% improvement in pain ratings
after 16 weeks of treatment .  Patients who did not have at least 30% improvement 
stopped study treatment and entered the follow -up period.

4The follow -up period lasted 24 weeks.  During this time, the study doctors monitored 
the patients for any medical problems.  The figure below shows what happened 
during this study.
Each patient participated inthe study for up to 80 weeks , and the entire study took 
about 3½ years to complete.  The Sponsor ran this study at 191doctor’s offices and 
clinics inEurope, Asia, and North America .  It began 18August 2015and ended 
20December 2018.  784men (43%)and 1041 women (57%) participated.  All 
patients were between the ages of 19and 8 4. 
Patients were to be treated for up to 56 weeks and complete the 24 -week follow -up 
period . A total of 1825 patient s joined the study and received study treatment.  Of 
these patients ,1181 (65%) finished the study .  There were 644patients (35%)who left 
before the study was over by their choice or because they had a medical problem and 
a doctor decided it was best for a patient to stop the study.
When the study ended in December 2018, the Sponsor began reviewing the 
infor mation collected.  The Sponsor then cr eated a report of the results. This is a 
summary of that report.

5WHAT WERE THE RESULTS OF THE STUDY?
Did patients who received tanezumab have an improvem ent in 
chronic lower back pain symptoms, com pared to patients who 
received placebo?
To answer this question, the researchers looked at the patients’ low back pain ratings
from before the start of study treatment up to week 16to see if there was an 
improvement .
On average, patients who received tanezumab 10mg had a greater improvement in 
chronic low back pain symptoms , compared to patients who received placebo .The 
researchers have decided that these results are not likely a result of chance.  
On average, p atients who received tanezumab 5mgalso had a greater improvement in 
chronic l ow back pain symptoms , compared to patients who received placebo.  
However, this improvement was not large enough to show that one treatment was 
more effective than another.  This difference could have been due to chance.
This does not mean that everyone in this study had these results . Other studies may 
produce different results , as well .  These are just some of the main findings of the 
study, and more information may be available at the websites listed at the end of this 
summary.   
WHAT MEDICAL PROBLEMS DID PATIENTS
HAVE DURING THE STUDY?
The researchers recorded any medical problems the patients had during the study. 
Patients could have had medical problems for reasons not related to the study (for 
example, caused by an underlying disease or by chance). Or, medical problems could 
also have been caused by a study treatment, or by another medicine the patient was 
taking. Sometimes the cause of a medical problem is unknown. By comparing 
medical problems across many treatment groups in many studies, docto rs try to 
understand what the side effects of an experimental drug might be.

6During the treatment period, 615out of 1008 patients who received tanezumab (61%) 
had at least 1 medical problem .A total of 15patients (1%) left the study during the 
treatment period because of medical problems.   The most common medical problems 
during the treatment period are listed below.

7WERE THERE ANY SERIOUS MEDICAL 
PROBLEMS?
A medical problem is considered “serious” when it is life -threatening, needs hospital 
care, or causes lasting problems .  
A total of 34out of 1008 patients (3%) who received tanezumab had serious medical 
problems during the treatment period , including 1 patient (1%) who received placebo 
followed by tanezumab 5 mg, 10 patients (2%) who received tanezumab 5 mg,
8patients ( 8%) who received placebo followed by tanezumab 10mg, and 15patients 
(4%) who received tanezumab 10 mg .
7patients died during the study period of 80 we eks.  None of these deaths were 
considered to be related to the study treatment by the study doctors.
