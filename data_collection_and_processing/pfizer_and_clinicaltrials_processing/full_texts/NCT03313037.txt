 2 WHY WAS THIS STUDY DONE?  
Streptococcus pneumoniae is a type of bacteria  that can cause serious diseases, including 
infections of the lung ( pneumonia ), brain lining ( meningitis ), blood ( bacteremia ), or 
ear (otitis).  These infections may be very serious in young children and older adults.  
Streptococcus pneumoniae is also known as S.  pneumoniae  or pneumococcus .  Currently 
there are 100  known types of S. pneumoniae.  
This study is about a vaccine called the “20 -valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine”, 
or 20vPnC.  A vaccine is used to help prevent infection by helping the body to fight 
off germs.  20vPnC may help to prevent infections caused by S.  pneumoniae.  It is called 
"20-valent" because 20vPnC prevents 20 of the most common types of S. pneumoniae . 
20vPnC is an investigational vaccine and it was not approved for general use  at the 
time of this study.  
After a vaccine is injected into a person’s body, the body responds  to help fight 
infections and prevent diseases.  The response to vaccines includes making 
“antibodies”, which are proteins that fight infections and help to prevent diseases.   
In the United States, the “13 -valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine”, or 13vPnC , is 
currently approved for preventing S. pneumoniae diseases in children and adults.  
13vPnC is made up of components to prevent diseases caused by 13 types of 
S. pneumoniae.  20vPnC has the same components found in 13vPnC, plus 7 additional 
components that may widen protection.  The Pneumovax 23 vaccine, or PPSV23, is made up of components to prevent diseases caused by 23 types of S. pneumoniae . 
The main purpose of this study was to learn about the safety of 20vPnC in participant s aged between 60 and 64 y ears.  The researchers wanted to know if any of 
the participant s had redness, swelling, or pain at the injection site after they were 
given the vaccine.  The researchers also wanted to know abou t participant s who had a 
fever, felt tired, had headache s, muscle pain s, and/or pain in the joints  or took 
medicine for pain or fever after the vaccination .  
 
 3 WHAT HAPPENED DURING THE STUDY?  
This study compared 2 groups of participant s to find out if participant s given the 
20vPnC vaccine followed by placebo reacted differently compared to participant s 
given the comparator vaccine  of 13vPnC  followed by PPSV23 .  A placebo d oes not 
have any vaccine  in it, but it looks just  like the study vaccine .  A comparator is usua lly 
a licensed drug or vaccine this is similar to the one being tested in the clinical study.  
The study included adult participant s, aged between 60 and 64 years , who had not 
previously been vaccinated with a  pneumococcal vaccine (13vPnC  or PPSV23) . 
This trial was “double -blinded”.  This means that participant s and doctors did not 
know which participant  received 20vPnC and placebo vaccines or the comparator 
vaccine 13vPnC and PPSV23 .  This was done to make sure that the clinical study 
results were not influenced in any way.  Participant s were put into 1 of the 2 vaccine 
groups by chance alone.  This is known as a “randomized” study.  This is done to 
make the groups more similar .  Reducing differences between the groups (like age or 
the number of men and women), makes the groups more even to compare.  
While participant s were only in the study for 12 months , the entire study took around 
14 months to complete.  The Sponsor ran this s tudy at  14 locations in the United 
States .  It began on 10  October 2017 and ended on 10  December  2018.  There were 
195 men and 248  women who participated.  All participant s were between the ages of 
60 and 64 years.  
Participant s were given 1 injection of v accine (20vPnC or 13vPnC ) at the s tart of the 
study  (Vaccination 1)  and a second injection of vaccine (placebo or PPSV23) 
approximately 1  month later  (Vaccination 2).  The participants had their h ealth 
check ed and blood samples were collected before Vaccination 1 and before 
Vaccination 2.  The participant s then returned to the study center for further 
assessments and for  blood sample s to be collect ed 1 month after Vaccination  2.  
Participant s then had their hea lth checked by telephone 6  months after Vaccination  1.  
The participant s returned to the study center for the final assessments and for b lood 
sample s to be collect ed 12 months after Vaccination  1.    
 
 4 When the participant s visited the study center for Vaccin ation 1, they were given an 
electronic diary ( e-diary ).  They were asked to record information about redness, 
swelling, or pain at the injection site within 10 days after V accination  1 in the e -diary .  
The participant s were also to use the e-diary to record information about fever, 
tiredness, headache, muscle pain, and/or pain in the joints as well as any medicines 
taken to treat pain or fever within 7 days after V accination  1.   
 
a Of the 221 participant s given 20vPnC, 22 0 completed the e -diary after V accination  1. 
 
Of the 444 participant s who started the study, t here were 443 participant s who 
received the first vaccine and 1 participant  who did not receive Vaccination 1.   There 
were 427 participant s who then went on to receive the second vaccine  and 
16 participant s who did not receive Vaccination 2  (8 in the placebo group and 8 in the 
PPSV23 group) .  There were 404 participant s who finished th is 12-month study.  
There were 40 participant s who did not finish the study and these participant s left 
before the study was over by their choice or a doctor decided it was best for a 
participant  to stop being in the study.  
When the study ended in December 2018 , the Sponsor began reviewing the 
information collected.  The Sponsor then created a r eport of the results.  This is a 
summary of that report. 
 
 
 5 WHAT WERE THE RESULTS OF THE STUDY?  
What was the percentage of participant s who had redness, 
swelling, or pain at the injection site within 10 days after 
Vaccination 1?  
The percentage of participant s with redness, swelling, or pain at the injection site 
within 10 days after being vaccinated was similar for those receiving a dose of 20vPnC 
or 13vPnC .  Redness, swelling, or pain at the injection site was  recorded in the e -diary 
by 134 out of 220 participant s (61%) who received the 20vPnC vaccine and filled out  
the e -diary and by 126 out of 222  participant s (57%) who received the 13vPnC  
vaccine  and filled out the e -diary (see table below).  Pain at the injection  site was the 
most common of these reaction s in the 2  vaccine groups .  There was 1  participant  
who had severe redness after the 20vPnC vaccine and 1  participant  who had severe 
pain after 13vPnC .  All other cases of redness, swelling, or pain at the injection site 
were mild or moderate in severity.

Note: This clinical trial did not look at the number of participant s who had redness, swelling or pain 
at the injection site after Vaccination  2 when participant s were given placebo or PPSV23.   
 
 6 What was the percentage of participant s who had fever, 
headache, tiredness, muscle pain, or joint pain within 7  days 
after Vaccination 1? 
The percentage of participant s with fever, headache, tiredness, muscle pain, or joint 
pain within 7 days after being vaccinated was similar for those receiving a dose of the 
20vPnC or 13vPnC vaccine.   
Fever, headache, tiredness, muscle pain, or joint pain were recorded in the e -diary  by 
120 out of 220 participant s (55%) who received the 20vPnC vaccine a nd filled out the 
e-diary and by  124 out of 222 participant s (56%) who received the 13vPnC  vaccine 
and filled out the e- diary .  Muscle pain  was seen most commonly in the 2  vaccine 
groups.  There was 1  participant  who had severe tiredness and 1 participant  who had 
a severe  headache a fter 20vPnC .  There were 4  participant s who had severe tiredness, 
2 participant s who had severe headache, and 1 participant  who had severe joint pain 
after 13vPnC .  All other cases of fe ver, headache, tiredness, muscle pain, or joint pain 
were mild or moderate in severity.  
Overall, medicine was taken to treat pain and/or reduce fever  after Vaccination 1 by 
35 out of 220 participant s (16%) who received  20vPnC and filled out the e -diary and 
by 49 out of 222 participant s (22%) who received 13vPnC  and filled out the e -diary .

Note: This clinical trial did not look at the number of participant s who had fever, tiredness, 
headache, muscle pain, joint pain or took medicine to treat pain or fever after Vaccination  2 when 
participant s were given placebo or PPSV2 3.  
This does not mean that everyone in this study had these results.  Other studies may 
produce different results, as well .  These are just some of the main findings of the 
study, and more information may be available at the websites listed at the end of this 
summary.    
 
 8 WHAT MEDICAL PROBLEMS DID 
PARTICIPANTS HAVE DURING THE STUDY?  
The researchers recorded any medical problems the participant s had during the study.   
Participant s could have had medical problems for reasons not related to the study (for 
example, caused by an underlying disease or by chance).  Or, medical problems could 
also have been caused by a study vaccine or by another medicine the participant  was 
taking.  Some times the cause of a medical problem is unknown.  By comparing 
medical problems across different vaccine groups in many studies, doctors try to 
understand what the side effects of an experimental vaccine might be.  
In the month after Vaccination 1, t here were 27  out of 221  participant s (12%) given 
20vPnC  and 29 out of 222 participant s (13%) given  13vPnC  who had at least 
1 medical problem.  The most common medical problems are listed below.

placebo and 40 out of 2 14 participant s (19%) given  PPSV23 injection who had at least 
1 medical problem.  The most common medical problems are listed below.

The doctors thought m ost of these medical problems seen after Vaccination 1 and 
Vaccination 2 were not linked to any of the vaccines . 
There were no participant s who left the study because of medical problems.    
 
 10 WERE THERE ANY SERIOUS MEDICAL 
PROBLEMS?  
A medical problem is considered “serious” when it is life -threatening, needs hospital 
care, or causes lasting problems.   
During the 12 -month study, there were 9 serious medical problems in  participant s in 
the “20vPnC/placebo ” group and 11  serious medical problems in participant s in the 
“13vPnC/PPSV23 group ”.  The 20vPnC/placebo group includes participant s who 
had the 20vPnC vaccine followed by the placebo vaccine whereas the 
13vPnC/PPSV23 gr oup includes participant s who had the 13vPnC vaccine followed 
by the PPSV23 vaccine.  Most serious medical problems happened  1 month or more 
after Vaccination 2  and there were 9 serious medical problems in the 20vPnC/placebo 
group  and 7  serious medical problems in the 13vPnC /PPSV23 group .  The serious 
medical problems that happened in the month after Vaccination 1 or Vaccination 2 
are listed below:  
• Within  1 month after Vaccination 1, t here was 1 serious medical problem of 
pneumococcal men ingitis in a participant  given  13vPnC .  Further  tests showed this 
was caused by a type of S. pneumoniae  that is not covered by the vaccine.  The 
doctors did not think this serious medical problem was related to the vaccine . 
• Within 1 month after Vaccination  2, there were 4  serious medical problems in 
participant s given 13vPnC .  These were prostate cancer , a minor stroke, kidney 
stones , and “ respiratory distress ”.  Respiratory  distress happens when the lungs are 
not working  properly and causes breathing difficulties.  
There were 21 newly diagnosed chronic medical condition seen in participants during 
this 12 -month study .  This included 13 newly diagnosed medical conditions  in the 
20vPnC/placebo group and 8 newly diagnosed medical conditions in the 
13vPnC /PPSV23 group .  Most of these chronic medical conditions were seen 
1 month or more after Vaccination 2 (9 in the 20vPnC/placebo group and 3 in the 
13vPnC /PPSV23 group).     
 
 11 None of the serious medical problems or the newly diagnosed chronic medical 
conditions were considered by the doctors to be related to any of the vaccines given 
in this study.  None of the participant s died during the study from medical problems.
