2WHY WAS THIS STUDY DONE?
Streptococcus pneumoniae is abacteria that can cause serious diseases, including infections 
of the lung ( pneumonia ), brain lining ( meningitis ), blood ( bacteremia ), or ear ( otitis ).  
These infections may be very serious in young children and older adults.  Streptococcus 
pneumoniae is also known as S.pneumoniae .  There are 100 types of S. pneumoniae .
This study is about a vaccine called the “20 -valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccin e”, 
or 20vPnC.  A vaccine is used to help prevent infection by helping the body to fight 
off germs.  20vPnC may help to prevent infections caused by S.pneumoniae.  It is called 
"20-valent" because 20vPnC prevents 20 of the most common types of S.pneumoni ae.
20vPnC is an investigational vaccine, which means that it has not been approved for 
general use and it is not yet known if it will protect against disease
caused by S. pneumoniae ,although studies are ongoing to assess how well 20vPnC 
works.
After a vaccine is injected into a person’s body, the body responds to help fight 
infections and prevent diseases. The response to vaccines includes making 
“antibodies”, which are proteins that fight infections and help to prevent diseases.  
In the United State s, the “13 -valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine”, or 13vPnC, is 
currently approved for preventing S.pneumonia ediseases in children and adults.  
13vPnC is made up of components to prevent diseases caused by 13 types of 
S.pneumoniae.  20vPnC has the same components found in 13vPnC, plus 7 additional 
components that may widen protection. 
The purpose of this study was to learn about the safety of 20vPnC and about the 
body’s antibody response to 3 different batches, or “lots”, of 20vPnC.   These 
3different lots contained the same components and were made in the same way. The 
researchers needed to compare 3 different lots of vaccine to be sure that the vaccines 
worked the same way and were safe to use.

3To learn about the body’s antibod y response, researchers asked this question:
Did20vPnC produce similar antibody responses in participants when it was
manufactured in 3 different lots ?
To answer this question, the researchers measured the amount of antibodies in 
participants’ blood 1 month after being vaccinated.
To learn about the safety of 20vPnC, researchers asked these questions:  
What was the percent ageof participants that had redness, swelling, or pain at 
the injection site within 10 days after being vaccinated with 20vPnC?
What was the percent ageof participants that had fever, headache, tiredness, 
muscle pain, or joint pain within 7 days after being vaccinated with 20vPnC?
What medical problems did participants have within 1 month after being 
vaccinated with 20vPnC ?
Did participants have any serious medical problems or any newly diagnosed 
chronic medical problems within 6 months after being vaccinated with 
20vPnC ? 
WHAT HAPPENED DURING THE STUDY?
This study compared 3 groups of participants to learn about the body’s antib ody
response to 20vPnC.  The information from the combined 20vPnC groups and a 
“control group” that received 13vPnC were used to learn about safety .  A control 
group is a group of participants that do not receive the vaccine being studied.   In this 
study, 13vPnC was used as the control because it is commonly used for preventing S.
pneumoniae diseases.
Participants were checked (screened) to make sure they were a good fit for the study.  
This study included adult men and women who:
Were between the ages of 18 and 49 years
Were considered to be healthy or with stable chronic disease by the study 
doctors

4Did not have a disease or take medicine that would be associated with a 
weakened immune system
Had never received any vaccine for S.pneumoniae  
This was a “ randomized” study, which means that participants were assigned to 
groups based on chance alone. Randomization is done to make the groups similar so 
that differences in antibody response or safety are most likely due to the different 
vaccine speople receiv ed.  
This study was also “double -blinded”.  This means that participants and study staff 
members who administered the vaccine did not know who was given which vaccine.  
This was done to make sure that the study results were not influenced in any way.
Participants who were a good fit for the study were assigned by chance alone to 
receive 1 of 4 vaccines:
20vPnC, Lot 1 (488 participants)
20vPnC, Lot 2 (489 participants)
20vPnC, Lot 3 (486 participants)
13vPnC (245 participants)
Participants were expected to participate in 3study visits.  At the first visit, blood 
samples were collected, and the participants received the vaccine.  The second visit 
was done about 1 month after the first visit. Blood samples were collected, and 
participants were checked for an y medical problems.  The third visit was done over 
the phone at the end of the study, and participants were asked about any medical 
problems.
The figure on the following page shows what happened during the study.

5While participants were in this study for about 6 months, the entire study took about 
9 months to complete since not all participants entered the study at the same time .  
The Sponsor ran this study at 21 locations in the United States.  It began 14 Februar y 
2019 and ended 9 October 2019 .  593 men (35%) and 1115 women (65%) 
participated.  All participants were between the ages of 18 and 49 years. 
Of the 1708 participants who joined the study and received vaccine, 1635 (96%) 
finished it.  A total of 7 3participants (4%) left the study early by their choice or 
because a doctor decided it was best for them to stop the study.
Throughout the course of the study, the Sponsor reviewed the data. When the study 
ended in October 2019 and after antibody testing was co mpleted, the Sponsor then 
created a report of the results.  This is a summary of that report.

6WHAT WERE THE RESULTS OF THE STUDY?
Did20vPnC produce similar antibody responses in 
participants when it wasmanufactured in 3 different lots ?
To answer this question, the researchers measured the amount of antibodies in 
participants’ blood 1 month after being vaccinated.  They looked to see if the amount 
of antibodies that the body produced for each of the 20 vaccine components was 
similar in participants who received vaccines from Lot 1, Lot 2, and Lot 3.
The researchers found that antibody levels for each of the 20 vaccine components 
were similar in participants who received vaccines from Lot 1, Lot 2, and Lot 3.  
Based on these results, the researchers have decided that the results are not likely the 
result of chance.  These results indicate that the Sponsor can produce 20vPnC 
consistently so that antibody levels do not vary from one batch to the next. 
These are just some of the main findings of the study, a nd more information may be 
available at the website listed at the end of this summary.  
WHAT MEDICAL PROBLEMS DID 
PARTIC IPANTS HAVE DURING THE STUDY?
The researchers recorded any medical problems the participants had during the study.  
Participants could have had medical problems for reasons not related to the study (for 
example, caused by an underlying disease or by chance).  Or, medical problems could
also have been caused by study vaccine or by another medicine the participant was 
taking.  Sometimes the cause of a medical problem is unknown.  By looking at 
medical problems across many treatment groups in many studies, doctors try to 
understand what th e side effects of an experimental drug (in this case experimental 
vaccine) might be.

7What was the percent ageof participants that had redness, 
swelling, or pain at the injection site within 10 days after 
being vaccinated with 20vPnC ?
The percentage of par ticipants with redness, swelling, or pain at the injection site 
within 10 days after being vaccinated was similar for those receiving a dose of 20vPnC 
or 13vPnC.  The table below shows the number of participants with these reactions.

Swelling at injection site 124 (9%) 21 (9%)
Redness at injection site 102 (7%) 15 (6%)
What was the percent ageof participants that had fever, 
headache, tiredness, muscle pain, or joint pain within 7 days 
after being vaccinated with  20vPnC ?
The percentage of participants with fever, headache, tiredness, muscle pain, or joint 
pain within 7 days after being vaccinated was similar for each vaccine group.  The 
table on the following page shows the number of participants with these reactions.

What medical problems did participants have within 
1month after being vaccinated with 20vPnC?
113 out of 1708 (7%) participants in this study had at least 1 new or worsening 
medical problem within 1 month after being vaccinated, including 100 out of 
1463 participants (7%) who received 20vPnC and 13 out of 245 participants (5%) 
who received 13vPnC .  A total of 7 participants (less than 1%) had a medical problem 
that the doctor thought was related to the study vaccine, including 5 participants (less 
than 1%) who received 20vPnC and 2 participants (1%) who received 13vPnC. The 
other related medical problems happened in 1 participant each.  No participants left 
the study because of one of these medical problems. 
WERE THERE ANY SERIOUS MEDICAL 
PROBLEMS?
A medical problem is considered “serious” when it is life -threatening, needs hospital 
care, or causes lasting problems.

9Did participants have any serious medical problems or any 
newly diagnosed chronic medical problems within 6 months 
after being vaccina tedwith  20vPnC ?
10 out of 1 463participants who received 20vPnC (1%) had serious medical problems 
within 6 months after being vaccinated.  None of these serious medical problems 
were thought to be related to the study vaccine by the study doctors.  No par ticipants 
who received 13vPnC (0%) had serious medical problems within 6 months after being 
vaccinated.
20 out of 1708 participants in this study (1%) had newly diagnosed chronic medical 
problems within 6 months after being vaccinated.  This included 15out of 
1463 participants ( 1%) who received 20vPnC and 5 out of 245 participants ( 2%) who 
received 13vPnC.  None of these chronic medical problems were thought to be 
related to the study vaccine by the study doctors.  No participants died during this 
study. 
In summary, t he researchers concluded from all of the above data on medical 
problems experienced by participants during the study that the safety of 20vPnC is 
similar to 13vPnc. They also concluded that the majority of medical problems
reported in th isstudy were not related to study vaccine.
