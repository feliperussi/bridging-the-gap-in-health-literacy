Why was this study done?
What is Psoriatic Arthritis ?
Psoriatic Arthritis (PsA) is a type of arthritis that affects some people with the skin 
condition psoriasis. Psoriasis causes skin cells to multiply faster than normal which
makes the skin build up into bumpy red patches covered with white scales. PsA 
typically causes affected joints to become swollen, stiff ,and painful. PsA is thought 
to happen as a result of the immune system mistakenly attacking healthy tissue and 
causing lasting inflammation . Like psoriasis, PsA is a long -term condition that can get 
progressively worse .
What is PF-06700841 ?
PF-06700841 is a medicine that has shown potential in previous studies for the 
treatment of psoriasis.  PF-06700841 stops the functioning of enzymes known as 
janus kinase 1 (JAK1) and tyrosine kinase 2 (TYK2).  These enzymes control signals 
to the immune system cells that produce proteins known as cytokines which cause 
inflammation.  This inflammation is used by the immune system to fight infections 
that may be caused by viruses or bacteria.  In people with PsA, the body's immune 
system begins to attack healthy cells and tissue by causing inflammation.  By stopping 
the function of JAK1 and TYK2, PF-06700841 may prevent the abnormal immune 
system response and inflammation in patients with PsA.
What was the purpose of this study?
The purpose of t his study was to determine the effectiveness of PF-06700841 in 
participants with active (currently experiencing symptoms) PsA after 16 weeks of 
treatment in comparison with a placebo.   After 16 weeks, the purpose of this study 
was to provide all participan ts with PF-06700841 to determine the safety and 
beneficial effect of this medicine after using it for 1 year. 
PF-06700841 is a new investigational medicine.  A new investigational 
medicine is one that is currently not approved in a country.
A placebo looks like the study medicine but does not contain any medicine.  
Researchers use a placebo to see if the study medicine works better or is safer 
than not taking anything.

What happened during the study?
How was the study done?
Researchers tested PF-06700841 on a group of study participants to find out if study 
participants with PsA taking PF-06700841 (the test medicine) had a higher ACR20 
score than study participants with PsA taking placebo.  A description of how the 
study was done can be seen in Figure 1 below.Researchers wanted to know: 
Did the participants taking PF-06700841 have better effectiveness in 
the treatment of PsA when compared to placebo?
Researchers wanted to determine the American College of Rheumatology 20 
(ACR20) score of participants taking PF-06700841 and compare it to the 
ACR20 score of participants taking placebo after 16weeks of treatment. 
The ACR20 score was used to assess and establish the improvement by 20% 
in tender swollen joints of participants along with a 20% improvement in at 
least three of the following five factors: 
oInflammation in joints. 
oParticipants tr eatment response and progress. 
oDoctors’ observations of participants treatment response and progress.
oDaily pain in joints.
oHow much PsA interferes with the participants daily activities.
Whether PF-06700841 caused any medical problems in 
participants?
Researchers also wanted to learn more about the safety of PF-06700841 .  
They monitored the pa rticipants for any medical problems that happened 
while they were in the study.

determined at 16 weeks.
The study participants and researchers did not know who took PF-06700841 and who 
took the placebo.  This is known as a “blinded” study.  Study par ticipants were 
assigned to each group by chance alone.
The study was only slightly affected by the COVID -19 pandemic as the study 
participants had already completed the treatment portion of the study. 
Where did this study take place? 
The Sponsor ran this study at 47 locations in 11 countries in Australia , Asia, and 
Europe.
When did this study take place?
It began 13 June 2019 and ended 15 January 2021.
Who participated in this study?
The study included participants who were between the ages of 18 and 75years old, 
had symptoms of PsA for at least 6 months, and had active PsA despite taking 
anti-inflammatory medications for at least 4 weeks before the start of the study.
A total of 102men participated
A total of 116women participated
All participants were between the ages of 21and 73 years

Participants were to be treated until the ACR20 scores at the Week 16 and Week 52 
study visits were determined .  Of the 218participants who started the study, 
203participants completed the study v isit at Week 16.  Of the 203participants who 
completed the study visit at Week 16, 168participants completed the study visit at 
Week 52.
Fifteen participants did not complete the Week 16 study visit because:
The participants left the study by their own c hoice, and/or
The participants did not experience an improvement in their PsA, and/or
The participants experienced medical problems
After Week 16, an additional 35 participants left before the study was over by their 
choice or a doctor decided it was best for a participant to stop being in the study.
How long did the study last?
Study participants were in the study for about 12months .  The entire study took 
19months to complete.
When the study ended in January 2021 , the Sponsor began reviewing the information 
collected.  The Sponsor then created a report of the results.  This is a summary of that 
report.
What were the results of the study?
Did the participants taking PF -06700841 have a better ACR20 score 
in the treatment of PsA when compared to placebo? 
Researchers determined the ACR20 score for participants with PsAtaking 
PF-06700841 and for participants taking placebo at Week 16 (Figure 2).

What medical problems did participants have during 
the study?
The researchers recorded any medic al problems the participants had during the study.  
Participants could have had medical problems for reasons not related to the study (for 
example, caused by an underlying disease or by chance).  Alternatively , medical 
problems could also have been caused by a study treatment or by another medicine 
the participant was taking.  Sometimes the cause of a medical problem is unknown.  Did the study medication have a better effect compared to 
placebo?
At Week 16, participants who took the study medication had an ACR20 score of:
PF-06700841 10 mg group : 65%
PF-06700841 30 mg group : 67%
PF-06700841 60 mg group : 75%
Placebo group: 43%
At Week 52, participants who took the study medication had an ACR20 score of:
PF-06700841 10 mg to PF-06700841 60 mg group : 56%
PF-06700841 10 mg to PF-06700841 30 mg group : 60%
PF-06700841 30 mg group : 70%
PF-06700841 60 mg group : 62%
Placebo to PF-06700841 30 mg group : 67%
Placebo to PF-06700841 60 mg group : 62%
Based on these results, the researchers have decided that the results are not likely the 
result of chance.  The study medication may have a beneficial effect on participants 
with PsA.
This does not mean that everyone in this study had these results. These are just some 
of the main findings of this study.

By comparing medical problems across many treatment groups in many studies, 
doctors try to understand what effects a study medica tion might have on a participant.
One hundred and nineteen out of 218 (55%) participants in this study had at least 
1medical problem in the first 16 weeks of the study.  One hundred and sixty out of 
218 (73%) participants in this study had at least 1 medi cal problem by Week 52.  A 
total of 3 participants left the study by Week 52 because of medical problems.   The 
most common medical problems ,those reported by more than 5% of participants ,are 
described in Table 1 below.
Below are instructions on how to read Table 1. 
Instructions for Understanding Table 1. 
The 1stcolumn of Table 1lists medical problems that were commonly 
reported during the study.  All medical problems reported by more 
than 5% of participants are listed.
The 2ndto 7thcolumn tells us the number of participants in the 
groups below who reported each medical problem . Next to this 
number is the percentage of the participants taking the study 
medication who reported the medical problem.

Did study participants have any serious medical 
problems?
A medical problem is considered “serious” when it is life-threatening, needs hospital 
care, or causes lasting problems.
Twelve out of 218 participants (6%)had serious medical problems.  Of the serious 
medical problems, three events were considered to be related to study medication as 
follows:
One participant in the PF-06700841 30 mg group had severe ear infection .  
One participant in the placebo to PF-06700841 30mg treatment group had 
infection of the lung (viral pneumonia) .  
One participant in the placebo to PF-06700841 60mg treatment group had 
infection of the lung (pneumonia) and COVID -19 virus.  
No participants died during the study.
