2WHY WAS THIS STUDY DONE?
Some women with breast cancer have high levels of a certain protein receptor on the 
surface on their cancer cells.  This protein is called HER2 (human epidermal growth 
factor receptor 2).  A cell with too many HER2 receptors is stimulat ed to grow and 
multiply too fast and can become a cancer.  When women with breast cancer have too 
much of this protein their cancer is called “HER2 -positive”.
Trastuzumab is an approved drug for the treatment of patien ts with HER2 -positive 
cancer and has been available for patient use by prescription for several years. The 
name for trastuzumab , which is approved for sale, is Herceptin®. PF-05280014 was 
theinvestigational drug in this study .An investigational drug is one that is not 
approved fo r sale .
Researchers think that PF-05280014 works like Herceptin®in the body.  Herceptin®is
an antibod y, which is a type of protein.  Herceptin®bindsto the HER2 receptor on 
the surface of cells .  By attaching to the HER2 receptor, this medicine can bloc k the 
signals that cause the cells to grow and multiply.  
Patients who were in this study received either PF -05280014 or Herceptin®in 
combination with Taxotere®and carboplatin.  Taxotere®and carboplatin are standard
chemotherapy treatments for breast c ancer.  They were used in this study because 
they are commonly given to patients by doctors for the treatment of breast cancer.  In 
thisstudy, women were given these medicines as a first step to shrink the tumor 
before surgery (neoadjuvant).  All women in this study were planned to have surgery 
after treatment.

3WHAT HAPPENED DURING THE STUDY?
This study compared 2groups of patients .  Researchers wanted to find out if 
PF-05280014 worked similarly to Herceptin®in patients with breast cancer.   
Thisstudy included adult women who:
Had newly diagnosed, early breast cancer
Did not receive prior treatment for the irbreast cancer
Planned to get surgery for the irbreast cancer tumor after chemotherapy
The patients and researchers did not know who took PF-05280014 and who took 
Herceptin®.  This is known as a “ double -blinded” study.   Researchers use 
“double -blinded” studies to make sure that the results of the study are not influenced 
in any way.  Patients were put into 1 of 2 treatment groups by chance alone .  This is 
known as a “randomized” study.  This is done to make the groups more similar for 
things like age and race. Reducing differences between the groups makes the groups 
more even to compare.  Patients had a 50% chance (1 in 2chances , likethe flip of a 
coin) of getting either treatment.
For 4 weeks, patients were checked (screened) to make sure they met all the 
requirements to be in the study.  Then, patients were put into 1 of 2 groups and were 
given 6 cycles of treatment.  Each cyc le occurred every 3 weeks.  After taking the 
study medicines, patients were followed by researchers for 4 weeks (follow -up phase) 
to see how they did after taking study medicines.
While patients were only in the study for about 7 months , the entire study t ook
17months to complete.  Pfizer ran this study at 46locations in 10countries in
Europe and the United States .  It began 23September 2014 and ended 
09March 2016. 226women participated.   1patient was randomized, but did not 
receive any study drug. All patients were between the ages of 24and 79.

4Thediagram below shows what ha ppened to patients in the study.
Patients were supposed to be treated through 6cycles of treatment. Of the
225patients who got at least 1 cycle of treatment , 215finished the study .  10patients 
left before the study was over by their choice or because a doctor decided it was best 
fora patient to stop the study.
When the study ended inMarch 2016, Pfizer began reviewing the infor mation 
collected.  Pfizer then cr eated a report of the results. The following is a summary of 
that report.

5WHAT WERE THE RESULTS OF THE STUDY?
Does PF -05280014 work similar lyto Herceptin®in the body?
Researchers wanted to see if the amount of PF-05280014 in the blood (blood levels) 
of the patients wassimilar to that of Herceptin®.
This study showed that PF -05280014 and Herceptin®had similar blood levels .  
Researchers chose a certain blood level as the target for these study medicines.  Blood 
tests showed that p atients in bo th groups, on average, reached this comparable blood 
level byCycle 5 of treatment.  After Cycle 5, the blood level of study medicine in the 
body remained similar until Cycle 6.  These results were comparable for both study
medicines.
The rese archers also looked to see if patient s had achieved pathologic complete 
response, or “pCR”.  This is when no cancer cells are found in the breast or lymph 
nodes after treatment for their cancer.   This study showed that a similar amount of 
women had pCR for both groups.  Based on these results and the number of patients , 
the researchers have concluded that the results are not likely the result of chance.
This does not mean that everyone in this study had these results, and anindividual 
result could be be tter or worse than that of the overall group.  Other studies may get
different results.  These are just some of the main findings of the study, and more 
information may be available at the websites listed at the end of this summary.

6WHAT MEDICAL PROBLE MS DID PATIENTS
HAVE DURING THE STUDY ?
The researchers recorded any medical problems the patients had during the study. 
Patient s could have had medical problems for reasons not related to the study (for 
example, caused by an underlying disease or by chance). Or, medical problems could 
have been caused by a study treatment, or by another drug the patient was taking
during the stud y. Sometimes the cause of a medical problem is unknown. By 
comparing medical problems across many treatment groups in many studies, doctors 
try to understand what the side effects of an experimental drug might be.
A total of 3 patients le ft the study due to medical problems .  212 out of 225 patients 
in this study had at least 1 “non-serious ” medical problem (that means a medical 
problem that is not life-threatening, does not cause lasting problems, or needs hospital 
care).  The most common non-serious medical pro blems reported by patients in this 
study are listed below. 
Loss of hair, low red blood cell count, and low white blood cell count were the most 
frequently reported medical problems patients experienced during the study .  The y
were similar between both the PF -05280014 and Herceptin®groups.

8WERE THERE ANY SERIOUS MEDICAL 
PROBLEMS ?
A medical problem is considered “serious” when it is life -threatening, causes lasting 
problems, or needs hospital care.  
13patients (6%,or 13 out of 225 patients) had serious medical problems ,7patients in 
thePF-05280014 group and6patients in the Herceptin®group .  Only 1 of these
serious medical problem swasconsidered by the patient’s study doctor or Pfizer to be
related to PF-05280014 treatment.  Specifically, 1patient in the PF -05280014 group 
died during the study due to low white blood cell count which thepatient’s study 
doctor and Pfizer considered to be related to the study treatment.   
Please see the table below for more information on what types of serious medical 
problems patients had.
