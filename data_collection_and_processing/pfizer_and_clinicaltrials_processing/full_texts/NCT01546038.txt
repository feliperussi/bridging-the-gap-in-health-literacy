2WHY WAS THIS STUDY DONE?
Acute myeloid leukemia (or “AML”) and myelodysplastic syndrome (or “MDS”) are 
types of blood cancers that usually affect patients over the age of 40.  These cancers 
are caused by too many immature white blood cells being made in the bone marrow.  
This redu ces the ability of the body to make normal blood cells such as white blood 
cells (that fight off infections), red blood cells (that deliver oxygen to muscles and 
organs), and platelets (that help blood clot).  The treatment options for AML and 
MDS are limi ted if the patient can’t receive “intensive” chemotherapy (strong 
medications) because of other medical problems.  Researchers are looking for new 
medicines that can help patients with AML and MDS live longer without their cancer 
rapidly getting worse.
Glasdegib (now approved under the brand name Daurismo®in the United States) was 
the investigational medicine tested in this study, and it was not yet approved at the 
beginning of this study.  Glasdegib was developed to help reduce growth of cancerous 
stem ce lls in the bone marrow.  Cancer stem cells are cells that self -regenerate and 
contribute to tumor growth.  These cancer stem cells may be one of the reasons why 
some cancers return after chemotherapy treatment.  
This study was divided into 2 parts, or “ph ases”.  The main purpose of the first phase 
of the study (Phase 1) was to determine the best dose of glasdegib to use in the 
second phase of the study (Phase 2).  To do this, the researchers asked:
What dose -limiting toxicities, or “DLTs”, did patients hav e during 
1treatment cycle with glasdegib?
DLTs are certain medical problems caused by taking glasdegib which require 
the patient to lower the dose or stop taking the medicine temporarily or 
permanently.
For Phase 2, there were 2 main questions that the re searchers wanted to ask, 
depending on whether the patients were “Fit” (healthy enough to be treated with 
intensive chemotherapy) or “Unfit” (unable to be treated with intensive chemotherapy 
because of other medical problems):
How many Fit patients would ac hieve “complete remission” when 
taking glasdegib? 
090177e19345ec56\Approved\Approved On: 20-Apr-2020 03:53 (GMT)
3In this study, complete remission or complete response meant that the patients 
no longer had any evidence of AML or MDS.
Do Unfit patients taking glasdegib with non -intensive chemotherapy 
(low-dose Ara -C, or “LDAC”) live longer than those taking LDAC alone? 
In this study, Unfit patients received an alternative chemotherapy medicine 
(LDAC) that was approved for use in patients at the time.  
WHAT HAPPENED DURING THE STUDY?
This study included patients who:
Were newly diagnosed with AML or high -risk MDS, and had not received 
treatment for their AML before.  Patients could have received treatment for 
their MDS before enrolling in the study.
Aged ≥18 years (for all Phase 1 patients and Phase 2 Fit patients) or aged 
≥55years (for Phase 2 Unfit patients)
Able to walk around, take care of themselves, and be active for more than 50% 
of the day 
Patients were considered Unfit for intensive chemotherapy if they:
Were aged ≥75years, or
Were unable to do any work (suc h as household chores), or
Had evidence of kidney disease, or severe heart disease. 
What happened during Phase 1 of the study?
Phase 1 of this study compared 3 groups of patients that were assigned to 1 of 2 doses 
of glasdegib (either 100 mg or 200 mg) to find the recommended dose of glasdegib 
for the Phase 2 portion of the study.  The patients were also given chemotherapy 
treatment based on whether their doctor thought they were Fit or Unfit for intensive 
chemotherapy.
The fig ure on the next page shows what happened during Phase 1 of the study.

4During Phase 1, each patient took 100 mg or 200 mg of glasdegib in pill form, once 
daily by mouth for 28 days.  The patients were also treated with different 
chemotherapy drugs as show n above, and monitored for medical problems. 
What happened during Phase 2 of the study?
Phase 2 of the study compared 2 groups of Unfit patients to find out if patients taking 
glasdegib with non -intensive chemotherapy (LDAC) would live longer than those 
taking LDAC alone.  Unfit patients were assigned to each group by chance alone, 
which is known as a “randomized” study.  This is done to make the groups more 
similar, which makes comparing the groups more fair.  Twice as many patients were 
assigned to take glasdegib with LDAC, compared to LDAC alone.  Phase 2 also 
treated 1 group of Fit patients, who took glasdegib along with intensive 
chemotherapy, to find out what percent would achieve complete remission.
The figure below shows what happened during Phase 2 of the study.

5While most patients were only in the study for approximately 6 to 12 months, the 
entire study took over 6 years to complete.  The Sponsor ran this study at 48 locations 
in 6 countries in North America and Europe.  It began 27 June 2012 and ended 
04March 2019.  A total of 20 women and 32 men participated in Phase 1, and 
65women and 138 men participated in Phase 2.  All patients were between the ages 
of 27 and 92. 
Patients were to be treated until their AML or MDS stopped responding or got worse, 
until they developed unacceptable medical problems, or until they chose to stop 
treatment.  Of the 52 patients who started Phase 1 of the study, 9 finished the study.  
Of the 203 patients who started Phase 2 of the study, 23 finished the study.  Th e most 
common reason for not completing the study was because the patient died.  A total of 
3 patients left Phase 1 and 8 patients left Phase 2 before the study was over by their 
choice or a doctor decided it was best for a patient to stop being in the stu dy.
When the study ended in March 2019, the Sponsor reviewed the information 
collected.  The Sponsor then created a report of the results.  This is a summary of that 
report.

6WHAT WERE THE RESULTS OF THE STUDY?
During Phase 1 of the study, what dose -limitin g toxicities 
(DLT) were reported?
During Phase 1, researchers wanted to find the correct dose of glasdegib for treating 
patients with AML or MDS.  To find the correct dose, the researchers needed to 
know how many patients in each dose group had a DLT durin g their first 28 -day 
treatment cycle.
There was 1 patient who had a DLT.  This patient was in the Fit group and took 
100mg of glasdegib once a day with intensive chemotherapy.  However, some of the 
patients who took either 100 mg or 200 mg of glasdegib on ce a day had other medical 
problems that caused them to temporarily stop or lower their dose of glasdegib.  
Using this information, the researchers decided that 100 mg once a day was the 
correct glasdegib dose to use during Phase 2 of the study.
During Phase 2 of the study, did Unfit patients taking 
glasdegib with non -intensive chemotherapy (LDAC) live 
longer than those taking LDAC alone?
The results suggested that Unfit patients taking glasdegib with LDAC lived longer 
than Unfit patients taking L DAC alone.  The researchers measured the “median time” 
between starting the study medicines and the patients dying of any cause.  The median 
time was the time point where half (50%) of the patients taking glasdegib with LDAC, 
or LDAC alone, had passed away from any cause.  Patients taking glasdegib with 
LDAC lived a median of 9 months from receiving their first dose of study medication 
until dying from any cause.  Patients taking LDAC alone lived a median of 5 months 
from receiving their first dose of study medication until dying from any cause.  Based 
on these results, the researchers have decided that the results are not likely due to 
chance.  The test medicine may be an option for treating patients with AML or MDS 
who are unable to be treated with intensi ve chemotherapy.
These results are shown in the graph on the next page.

7During Phase 2 of the study, what percent of Fit patients 
achieved complete remission while taking glasdegib?
To answer this question, the researchers looked at the results for all patients, and then 
for patients who were under the age of 55 and patients who were 55 years of age or 
older.  A total of 29 of 69 patients (42%) taking glasdegib with intensive 
chemotherapy achieved complete remission during the study.  A total of 7 of 
9patients (78%) under the age of 55 and taking glasdegib with intensive 
chemotherapy achieved complete remission during the study.  A total of 22 of 
60patients (37%) that were age 55 or older and taking glasdegib with intensive 
chemotherapy achieved comple te remission during the study.
These results are shown in the graph on the next page.

8This does not mean that everyone in this study had these results.  Other studies may 
produce different results, as well.  These are just some of the main findings of the 
study, and more information may be available at the websites listed at the end of this 
summary.  
WHAT MEDICAL PROBLEMS DID PATIENTS 
HAVE DURING THE STUDY?
The researchers recorded any medical problems the patients had during the study.  
Patients could have had medical problems for reasons not related to the study (for 
example, caused by an underlying disease or by chance).  Or, medical problems could 
also have been caused by a study treatment or by another medicine the patient was 
taking.  Sometimes th e cause of a medical problem is unknown.  By comparing 
medical problems across many treatment groups in many studies, doctors try to 
understand what the side effects of an experimental drug might be.
During Phase 1, all patients in this study had at least 1 medical problem.  A total of 
20patients left the study because of medical problems.  The most common medical 
problems during Phase 1 are listed below.  To view the full list of medical problems

WERE THERE ANY SERIOUS MEDICAL 
PROBLEMS?
A medical problem is considered “serious” when it is life -threatening, needs hospital 
care, or causes lasting problems.  
During Phase 1, 37 patients (71%, or 37 out of 52 patients) had serious medical 
problems.  Thirty -nine (39) patients passed away durin g Phase 1 of the study.  Most 
deaths were due to the patient’s AML or MDS getting worse. 
During Phase 2, 135 patients (70%, or 135 out of 194 patients) had serious medical 
problems.  In the Fit group, 35 patients had serious medical problems.  In the Unfit 
groups, 68 patients receiving glasdegib and LDAC had serious medical problems, 
compared to 32 patients receiving only LDAC.  A total of 162 patients passed away 
during Phase 2 of the st udy.  Most deaths were due to the patient’s AML or MDS 
getting worse.
