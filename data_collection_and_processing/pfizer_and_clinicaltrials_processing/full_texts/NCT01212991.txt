2WHY WAS THIS STUDY DONE?
Prostate cancer is the name for ca ncer that starts in the prostate, which is a small, 
walnut -sized gland that lies at the base of the bladder in men and is part of the male 
reproductive system.
Prostate cancer is a common cancer in men , and it is often a slow -growing cancer 
with few symptoms.
Enzalutamide is a prescription medicine that is approved to treat men with prostate 
cancer that no longer responds to a medical or surgical treatment that lowers 
testosterone .  Enzalutamide work sby interfering with the connections between 
androgens (a type of hormone that plays a role in male traits and reproductivity ) and 
androgen receptors ( a protein in the body that attaches to androgens).  This may help 
to slow the growth of prostate cancer.
The main goal of this study was to learn more about the use of enzalutamide in 
patients with prosta te cancer that was spreading to other parts of the b ody, despite 
receiving treatment to block androgens. Researchers wanted to answer these research 
question s:
How long did patients survive after receiving enzalutamide ,compared to 
placebo ?
How long did patients survive without cancer getting worse after r eceiving 
enzalutamide ,compared to placebo?
WHAT HAPPENED DURING THE STUDY?
This study compared 2 groups of patients to find out how long patients taking 
enzalutamide would survive, and how long they would survive without cancer getting 
worse, compared to patients taking a placebo.  A placebo does not have any active 
medicine in it, but looks just like the medicine. The study included patients who had 
prostate cancer that was spreading to other parts of the body, despite receiving 
treatment to block and rogens.  The patients had either mild symptoms or no 
symptoms due to prostate cancer when the study began .  To be eligible to join the 
study, p atients must have never used a type of medicine c alled “cytotoxic 
chemotherapy”, which is used to destroy cancer cells.

3Patients in this study were assigned to receive either enzalutamide or placebo.  The 
patients and researchers did not know who took enzalutamide and who took the 
placebo.  This is known as a “blinded” study.  Patients were assigned to each 
treatment group by chance alone.  This is known as a “randomized” study.  Putting 
people into groups by chance helps make the groups more similar so they can be 
compared. 
First, patients were checked by a study doctor to make sure they met the requirement s 
to join the study.  This was called the screening period.
During the treatment period, patients received the following treatments:
Group 1: 871 patients received enzalutamide at a dose of 160 milligrams, taken 
by mouth each day
Group 2: 844 patients rece ived placebo, taken by mouth each day
During the treatment period, p atients came to study visits every 4 weeks for the first 
49 weeks, then every 12 weeks thereafter.   At the study visits, imaging tests were done 
and patients were checked by study doctors to determine if p rostate cancer was 
getting worse .  Patients were also asked about any medical problems they were having.
Patients continued taking enzalutamide or placebo as long as the medicine was 
tolerated and they continued to receive treatment to blo ck androgens.  Patients were 
to stop taking enzalutamide or placebo if:
An imaging test showed that pr ostate cancer was getting worse
Orthey had complications caused by cancer spreading to the bone
And they began taking either cytotoxic chemotherapy or an experi mental drug 
for prostate cancer
Patients came to a follow -up visit 28 days after their last dose of enzalutamide or 
placebo.  Next, patients had the option to enter the long -term follow -up study.   
During this time, patients were followed -up every 12 weeks.
In September 2013, the researchers finished gathering the information they needed to 
answer the research questions, and the main part of the study ended.  Patients were 
then given the option to continue receiving enzalutamide (or switch to enzalutamide if 
they received placebo during the study).

4The figure below shows what happened during this study.
The amount of time that patients were in the study varied , but the entire study took
more than 8 years to complete , including both the main part of the study and the 
long-term follow -up part of the study .  The sponsor ran this study at 207 locations in 
22 countries in Asia, Australia, Europe, and North America. It began 28 September 
2010 and ended 8 February 2019 .  1,715 men joined study and received study 
treatment .  All patients were between the ages of 42 and 93 . 
Patients were to enter the long -term follow -up part of the study after they stopped 
taking study treatment .Of the 1,715 patients who started the study and received 
study treatment ,428 patients (25%) were still receiving study treatment when the 
main part of the study ended in September 2013.  1,287 patients (75%) stopped taking 
study treatment by their choice , because a doctor decided it was best for a patient to

5stop the study , because they had a medical problem, because prostate cancer got 
worse ,or because they passed away .
When the study ended in February 2019 , the Sponsor began reviewing the
infor mation collected.  The Sponsor the n created a report of the results. This is a 
summary of that report.
WHAT WERE THE RESULTS OF THE STUDY?
How  long did patients survive after receiving enzalutamide ,
compared to placebo ?
To answer this question, the researchers looked at the median length of time that 
patients survived after receiving enzalutamide.  A “median” is the middle number in a 
group of numbers. So, researchers looked at the length of time that each patient 
surviv ed, in order from highest to lowest.  The median is the middle number, and 
patients would have the same chance of surviving a longer time or a shorter time than 
this number.
The researchers first looked at data gathered from the beginning of the study unti l 
September 2013.  During this time, the median length of time that patients survived 
after receiving enzalutamide was 32.4 months, while the median length of time that 
patient s survived after receiving placebo was30.2 months . 
The researchers have de termined that these results are not likely based o n chance.  
The figure on the following page shows th esestudy result s.

6The researchers looked at the data again after all patients had been followed up with 
for at least 5 years (beginning of study until September 2017 ).  During this time, the 
median length of time that patients survived after receiving enzalutamide was 
35.5 months, while the median length of time that patients survived after receiving 
placebo was 31.4 months.
The researchers have determin ed that these results are not likely based on chance.  
The figure below shows these study results.

7How  long did patients survive without prostate cancer 
getting worse after receiving enzalutamide ,compared to 
placebo?
To answer this question, the researchers looked at imaging tests done between the 
beginning of the study and September 2013, to see if prostate cancer had gotten 
worse.  During this time, the median length of time that patients survived without 
prostate ca ncer getting worse after receiving placebo was 3.9months .  The researchers 
were not able to determine the median length of time that patients survived without 
prostate cancer getting worse after receiving enzalutamide , because not enough 
patients had wors ening prostate cancer during this time . 
The researchers have determined that these results are not likely based on chance.  
The figure below shows these study results.
This does not mean that everyone in this study had these results . Other studies may 
produce different results , as well .  These are just some of the main findings of the 
study, and more information may be available at the websites listed at the end of this 
summary.

8WHAT MEDICAL PROBLEMS DID PATIENTS
HAVE DURING THE STUDY ?
Researchers l ooked at medical problems that happened from the beginning of the 
study until the end of the long -term follow -up part of the study in February 2019. 
The researchers recorded any medical problems the participant shad during the study. 
Participant s could ha ve had medical problems for reasons not related to the study (for 
example, caused by an underlying disease or by chance). Or, medical problems could 
also have been caused by a study treatment, or by another medicine the participan t
was taking. Sometimes the cause of a medical problem is unknown. By comparing 
medical problems across many treatment groups in many studies, doctors try to 
understand what the side effects of an experimental drug might be.
1,648 out of 1,715 patients (96%) had at least 1 medic al problem .A total of
426patients (25%) stopped taking study treatment because of medical problems.  The 
most common medical problems are listed below.

WERE THERE ANY SERIOUS MEDICAL 
PROBLEMS?
A medical problem is considered “serious” when it is life -threatening, needs hospital 
care, or causes lasting problems .  
611out of 1,715 patients (36%) had serious medical problems .382patients (44%) in 
the enzalutamide group, and 229 patients (27%) in the placebo group had serious 
medical problems.
1,382patients (81%) died during the study.  Most of these deaths were due to prostate 
cancer progression .  Study doctors determined that 4 patients (less than 1%) died for 
reasons related to study treatment.
