This summary will describe the study results. If you have any questions about the study 
or the results, please contact the doctor or staff at your study site.Why was this study done?
What is Type 2 diabetes mellitus ?
Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a disease where the body does not make insulin or 
does not respond properly to the insulin in the blood.  Over time, T2DM can cause 
higher than normal levels of sugar in the blood (hyperglycemia) which can harm the 
health of people with T2DM.  People with T2DM are more likely to develop 
problems with their kidneys, heart, eyes, and n erves .  
What is Danuglipron ?
Danuglipron (dah-noog -lih-pron, PF-06882961) is an experimental medicine that is
taken by mouth and is not yet approved for use by health authorities . Danuglipron 
stimulates the glucagon -like peptide 1 receptor and may help lower blood sugar levels 
by increas inginsulin secretion .  Italso increases the feeling of fullness and lowers 
food intake.   
What was the purpose of this study?
Researchers wanted to see if danuglipron helps lower the glycosylated hemoglobin, or
“HbA1c ”,levels of participants with T2DM who se blood glucose is not under control 
with metformin treatment (a medicine approved to treat T2DM )and/or diet and 
exercise .  HbA1c is a blood test that measures the level of control of aperson’s blood 
sugar. This report describes what happened during the study, what the results of the 
study are, and how participants can learn more about the study. 
Researchers wanted to know:
Did taking danuglipron help lower the participants’ HbA1c levels 
when compared to taking a placebo ?What happened during the study?
How was the study done?
Researchers measured the effect of danuglipron by comparing HbA1c levels of 
participants who took different doses of the study medicine to participants who took 
a placebo.  A placebo does not have any medicine in it but looks just like the medicine 
being tested.   
Participants were put into 1 of 6 treatment groups by chance alone, like the flip of a 
coin.  This is known as a “randomized” study.  Randomiz ation is done to make the 
groups more similar for characteristics like age and sex.  In 5groups the participants 
received danuglipron and in 1 group participants received a placebo.  Participants in 
the 5groups that received danuglipron were given the st udy medicine at different 
doses, depending on which group they were put into .  
After the screening period , all participants took placebo for 14 days.  Participants then 
began taking danuglipron or placebo twice daily for 16 weeks based on which 
treatment group they were randomized into.  This part of the study was 
“double -blinded”.  This means the participants and study doctors did not know who 
was given which treatment during this part of the study.  Researchers use 
“double -blinded” studies to make sure t hat the results of the study are not influenced 
in any way.  Finally, participants c ompleted a follow -up visit 4 weeks after taking their 
last dose of danuglipron or placebo.
The study design is shown in the graphic on the next page .Participants took danuglipron (2.5 mg , 10 mg, 40 mg, 80 mg, or 120 mg )or placebo 
twice a day by mouth in the morning and evening with food.  For participants wh o
were assigned to take danuglipron at 40 mg twice daily and above, lower doses of 
danuglipron were started at th e beginning of the study and the dose level was slowly 
increased, or “titrated up” to the dose listed in the study design graphic. They 
continued taking the study medicine along with the same daily dose of metformin they 
were on before they entered the st udy for 16 weeks .  
Where did this study take place?
The Sponsor ran this study at 97 locations in 8countries in North America, Europe,
and Asia .
When did this study take place?
It began 07 July 2020 and ended 07 July 2021 .
Who participated in this study?
The study included adult participants with T2DM who were being treated with 
metformin and/or diet and exercise who also met the inclusion/exclusion criteria for 
things such as age ,typeof diabetes, body mass index (BMI), and total body weight .
A total of 209 men participated
A total of 202 women participated
All participants were between the ages of 28 and 7 6
Participants with Type 1 diabetes mellitus or certain conditions other than diabetes 
(heart or nerve complications) were excluded from the study.   The study doctor 
confirmed if a patient qualified for the study.
Participants were to be treated until the end of the 16 -week treatment period .  Of the
411participants who were treated in the study, 316 participants (77%) finished the 
double -blind treatment period ,and 359 participants (87%) finished the follow -up 
period.
A total of 95participants (23%) did not finish the double -blind treatment period .  The 
most common reason for not finishing the treatment period wasbecause of medical 
problems (57participants , 14% ).  Of the 52 participants (13%) who did not finish the 
follow -up period, the most common reason was because the participant chose to stop 
participating (20 participants , 5%).  
How long did the study last?
Study participants were in the study for approximately 22weeks (not including the 
screening period up to 4 weeks ).  The entire study took 12months to complete .
When the study ended in July 2021 , the Sponsor began reviewing the information 
collected.  The Sponsor then created a report of the results.  This is a summary of that 
report .
What were the results of the study?
Did taking danuglipron help lower the participants’ HbA1c levels 
when compared to taking a placebo?
Researchers found out that a t16 weeks, the participants receiving danuglipron had a 
greater average drop in HbA1c when compared to those receiving a placebo.  The 
results are shown in the graph on the next page .Did taking danuglipron help lower HbA1c levels compared to 
taking a placebo?
HbA1c levels are given in percentages.  Higher blood sugar levels lead to higher 
HbA1c levels .  
On average, participants who took danuglipron sawtheir HbA1c levels drop up to 
1.2% with the highest dose of 120mg compared to 0% for the placebo group .
Based on these results, the researchers have decided that the results ar enot likely 
the result of chance.  Danuglipron mayhelp lower HbA1c levels in patients with 
T2DM .  
This does not mean that everyone in this study had these results.  This is a summary 
of just some of the main results of this study.  Other studies may have different 
results.
What medical problems did participants have during 
the study?
The researchers recorded any medical problems the participants had during the study.  
Participants could have had medical problems for reasons not related to the study (for 
example, caused by an underlying disease or by chance). Or, medical problems could
also have been caused by a study treatment or by another medicine the participant was 
taking. Sometimes the cause of a medical problem is unknown. By comparing 
medical problems across many treatment groups in many studies, doctors try to 
understand what effects a study medication might have on a participant.
A total of 224out of 411participants (55%) in this study had at least 1 medical 
problem.   A total of 45participants (11%) stopped study treatment and 
12participants (3%) left the study because of medical problems .  The most common 
medical problems reported by 5% or more of total participants are shown in Table 1.
Below are instructions on how to read Table 1. 
Instructions for Understanding Table 1. 
The 1stcolumn of Table 1 lists medical probl ems that were commonly 
reported during the study.  All medical problems reported by 5% or 
more of total participants are listed .
The 2nd–7thcolumns tell how many of the participants in each 
treatment group (treated with danuglipron or placebo) reported each 
medical problem.  Next to this number is the percentage of the 
participants taking danuglipron or placebo who reported the medical 
problem . 
Using these instructions, you can see that 5 out of the 68 participants 
(7%) taking danuglipron 2.5 mg twice d aily reported nausea.  A total of 
2 of 66 participants (3%) taking a placebo reported nausea.Table 1. Commonly reported medical problems by study

problems?
A medical problem is considered “serious” when it is life -threatening, needs hospital 
care, or causes lasting problems.
A total of 13out of 411participants (3%) treated in the study had serious medical 
problems.  Most serious medical problems were not thought to be related to the study 
treatment.  One (1) participant in the danuglipron 80 mg group had a gallbladder
problem that the investigator thought might be related to study treatment .  
A total of 3participants passed away during the follow -up phase of the study from 
medical problems due to COVID -19. These deaths were not thought to be related to 
the study drug .
