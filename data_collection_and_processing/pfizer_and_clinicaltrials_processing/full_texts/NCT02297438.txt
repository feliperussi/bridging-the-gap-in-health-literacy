Why was this study done?
What is Advanced Breast Cancer ?
Sometimes, breast cancer can spread from the breast to other parts of the body, most 
often to the bones, lungs, liver, or brain.  This is called advanced breast cancer.  
Advanced breast cancer cannot be treated by surgery or radiation therapy with the 
intention to cure the cancer, butto slow down the development of the cancer and 
help the patient live longer.  The participants in this study had estrogen receptor -
positive [ER (+)] breast cancer, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 negative 
[HER2 ( -)] advanced breast cancer.  The cells of ER (+) breast cancer have receptors 
that allow them to use the hormone estrogen to grow and HER2 ( -) means that the 
participants have a normal amount of HER2 proteins in the breast cells (too much of 
this protein means that there is another type of cancer present).  This type [ER (+), 
HER2 ( -)] of advanced breast cancer is sensitive to hormonal treatment.  
What is Palbociclib ?
Palbociclib is a medicine that has been used to treat a specific type of breast cancer 
known as hormone receptor positive [HR (+)] andHER2 ( -).  A hormone receptor is 
a receptor molecule that binds to a specific hormone .  A breast cancer is classified as 
HR (+) if its cel ls have receptors for the hormones ;estrogen and progesterone.  
Palbociclib targets the functioning of specific proteins or enzymes called 
cyclin -dependent kinases (CDK4 and CDK6).  These enzymes are important for 
normal cell division and when they are dam aged, they may cause cancer cells to grow 
and spread.  Certain cancers, for example, ER (+), are more likely to have 
disturbances in CDK4 and CDK6.  Palbociclib prevents the CDK4 and CDK6 
enzymes from functioning which stops the cells from dividing and sto ps the growth 
of breast cancer cells.  
What was the purpose of this study?
The purpose of this research study was to compare the effect of the study drug, 
palbociclib, plus letrozole, with placebo plus letrozole to find out which is better for 
treating ad vanced breast cancer in Asian women who have not received any previous 
systemic treatment and have already experienced menopause (stopping of menstrual 
periods permanently ).

Palbociclib is a n approved medicine.  
Systemic treatment is any medication that travels through your body in the 
bloodstream to find, damage ,or destroy cancer cells. It includes 
chemotherapy, immunotherapy, hormone therapy ,or targeted therapy.
A placebo looks like the medicine under study but does not contain any 
medicine.  Researc hers use a placebo to see if the study medicine works better 
or is safer than not taking it.
Letrozole is a hormonal medicine that is approved for the treatment of 
advanced breast cancer that is sensitive to hormonal treatment.  Letrozole is
available outside of this research study by a doctor’s prescription .
Researchers wanted to know: 
Did the participants taking palbociclib plus letrozole have a better 
progression -free survival (PFS) than participants that were ta king 
placebo plus letrozole?
Researchers wanted to determine the PFS of participants taking palbociclib 
plus letrozole and compare it to the PFS of participants taking placebo plus 
letrozole. 
The PFS is the length of time during and after receiving a treatment for a 
disease, during which a patient lives with the disease not getting worse.
How participants tolerated palbociclib and whether it caused any 
medical problems?
Researchers also wanted to learn more about the safety and tolerability of 
palbocic lib.  
They monitored the participants for any medical problems that happened 
while they were in the study.

What happened during the study?
How was the study done?
Researchers tested palbociclib (test medicine) combined with letrozole on a group of 
study participants with advanced breast cancer to find out if it provided a longer PFS 
than study participants with advanced breast cancer taking placebo plus letrozole.  A 
description of the how the study was done can be seen in Figure 1 below.
Figure 1.  A description of how the study was do ne.
After the last dose of palbociclib treatment , study p articipants were contacted by the 
study team every 6 months to asked about:
Any changes in the health of the participant
Any medications the participant was taking
Study participants were assigned to each group by chance alone.  Neither the study 
participants nor the researchers knew who took palbociclib and who took the 
placebo. This is known as a “blinded” study. 
Where did this study take place?
The Sponsor ran this study at 52 locations across Mainland China, Hong Kong, 
Taiwan, Thailand, and Singapore.

When did this study take place?
It began 23 March 2015, and the primary completion date was 31 August 2020.  
Primary completion date corresponds to the date when the last participant was 
examined or received treatment and that results for the main results were collected.  
This study is ongoing.
Who participated in this study?
The study included participants with advanced breast cancer, who were between the 
ages of 18 and 70 years, had already experienced menopause, and had not received 
any systemic treatment for their advanced disease.
A total of 340 women participated and 339 women were treated in this study
All participants were between the ages of 29 and 70 years
Participants were to be treated until disease progression, death or unable to tolerate 
the treatment, or withdrawal of consent, whichever occurred first .  PFS was 
determined based on the disease progression or death of study participants .  Of the 
340participants who started the study, 138 are still participating in the study.
Two hundred and ninety participants discontinued the study treatment because
The participant died
The participant was lost to follow -up
The participant ’s cancer got worse
The partici pant experienced medical problems
The p articipants left by their choice or a doctor decided it was best for a 
participant to stop being in the study
How long did the study last?
The entire study took 5 years to the primary completion date, the study is still 
ongoing.   However, when the primary completion point was reached in August 2020, 
the Sponsor began reviewing the information collected.  The Sponsor then created a 
report of the results.  This is a summary of that report.

What were the results of the study?
Did the participants taking palbociclib plus letrozole have a longer 
PFS than participants that were taking placebo plus letrozole?
Researchers determined the median PFS (in months) for participants with advanced 
breast cancer taking palbociclib pl us letrozole and for participants taking placebo plus 
letrozole (Figure 2). The median is the middle number in a set of values when these 
values are arranged from smallest to largest .
Figure 2.  The median PFS of participants with advanced breast cancer .
Researchers found that participants who took palbociclib plus letrozole had a longer 
median PFS (22 months) in comparison to the participants taking placebo plus 
letrozole (median PFS of 14 months).
The hazard ratio (HR) was 0.677 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.529, 0.867 )which 
favored the palbociclib plus letrozole group.  The HRis a comparison between the 
probability of events in a treatment group (palbociclib plus letrozole ), compared to 
the probability of events in a control group (placebo plus letrozole ).  
090177e1978c0819\Approved\Approved On: 19-Jul-2021 02:52 (GMT)
AnHRof 1 means that both groups (treatment and control) are experiencing 
an equal number of events at any point in time .  
The 95% CI is a range with an upper and lower number calculated from a 
sample . Because the true population HRis unknown, this range describes 
possible values that the HRcould be .
Kaplan -Meier plots (graphs) are used to show what the probability of PFSis at a 
certain time point.  It usually compar estwo treatment groups in a study and was used 
to compare the palbociclib plus letrozole group and the placebo plus letrozole group 
in this study .  The Kaplan -Meier Plot of PFS is shown below in Figure 3.  This figure 
shows that participants in the palbociclib plus letrozole group had a higher probability 
of PFS than participants in the placebo plus letrozole group for most of the follow -up 
time.

Researchers have decided that the results are not likely the result of chance.  The 
addition of p albociclib to letrozole may help prolong the PFS of participants with 
advanced breast cancer and could be used as a treatment for advanced breast cancer.  
This does not mean that everyone in this study had these results.  These are just some 
of the main findings of this study.  Other studie s may have different results. 
What medical problems did participants have during 
the study?
The researchers recorded any medical problems the participants had during the study.  
Participants could have had medical problems for reasons not related to the s tudy (for 
example, caused by an underlying disease or by chance).  Or medical problems could 
also have been caused by a study treatment or by another medicine the participant was 
taking.  Sometimes the cause of a medical problem is unknown.  By comparing 
medical problems across many treatment groups in many studies, doctors try to 
understand what effects a study medication might have on a participant.
Three hundred and twenty three out of 339 (95%) participants who received 
treatment in this study had at least 1 medical problem.  A total of 18 participants 
discontinued the study because of medical problems.  The most common medical 
problems ,those reported by more than 20% of participants taking palbociclib plus
letrozole ,are describ ed below.

Below are instructions on how to read Table 1 . 
Instructions for Understanding Table 1. 
The 1stcolumn of Table 1 lists medical problems that were commonly 
reported during the study. All medical problems occurring in more 
than 20% of participants taking palbociclib are listed. The severity of 
the medical problems shown in Table 1 ranged from mild, moderate, 
severe/medically significant, life -threatening, or resulted in death. 
However , none of the medical problems shown in Table 1 was 
associated with death .
Some medical problems were grouped together because they were the 
same problem but reported differently . For example, "White blood 
cell decreased," and "leukopenia" or "Neutrophil count decreased" and 
"Neutropenia" .  These areknown as clustered medical problems.  For 
example , 144 of 168 (86%) participants taking palbociclib experienced 
a low white blood cell count, including the white blood cells known as 
leukocytes (leukopenia ).  These medical problems were grouped under 
the leukopenia cluster.  Clustered medical problems are marked with a 
star (*) and written in capital letters in column 1of Table 1.
The 2ndcolumn tells how many of the 168participants taking 
palbociclib reporte d each medical problem.  Next to this number is the 
percentage of the 168participants taking the study medication who 
reported the medical problem. 
The 3rdcolumn tells how many of the 171 participants taking a 
placebo reported each medical problem.  Nex t to this number is the 
percentage of the 171 participants taking the placebo who reported the 
medical problem.
Using these instructions, you can see that 165 out of the 168 (98%) 
participants taking palbociclib reported a low white blood cell count 
(for the white blood cells known as neutrophils [ neutropenia ]).  A total 
of 56out of the 171 (3 3%) participants taking a placebo reported an 
increase in liver enzymes (alanine aminotransferase) .  An increase in 
liver enzymes may indicate liver damage.

Did study participants have any serious medical 
problems?
A medical problem is considered “serious” when it is life -threatening, needs hospital 
care, results in death, or causes lasting problems.   Forty -two out of 339 participants 
(12%) had serious medical problems.  A larger percentage of participants in the 
palbociclib plus letrozole group than in the placebo plus letrozole group had at least 
1serious medical problem during the study.
