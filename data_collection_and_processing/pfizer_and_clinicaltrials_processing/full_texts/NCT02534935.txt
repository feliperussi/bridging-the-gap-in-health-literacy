2WHY WAS THIS STUDY DONE?
This study wasdone to find out if an experimental vaccin emight prevent 
meningococcal B disease.  Meningococcal disease is an infection that causes the 
tissues that surround the brain and spinal cord to become swollen and inflamed.  It is 
caused by a germ called “meningococcus .”  
There are different types of t he meningococcal germ :types A, B, C, and Y.  The type 
B meningococcal germ causes more meningococcal disease than any other type of 
meningococcal germ.  While the likelihood of getting meningococcal B disease is very 
low, children under the age of 4 years are more likely to get it than any other age 
group.
Vaccines are given to prevent people from getting infections ,and they work by 
helping people to fight off germs.  While there are vaccines available to prevent other 
types of meningococcal disease, there isn’t one available worldwide to prevent 
meningococcal B disease .
The vaccine given in this study isan injectable called bivalen t rLP2086.   This study 
tested bivalent rLP2086 to see if it will help people fight off the meningococcal B 
germ and provi de protection (immunity) against the disease.  This could only be done
by testing the vaccine in healthy people who have never had an infection with 
meningococcal disease before.  
As this disease is most common in babies and toddlers, the vaccine was test edin this 
age group.  This study was done to seeif toddlers made immune system proteins, 
called antibodies ,after receiving bivalent rLP2086.  Antibodies help the body to fight 
off diseases, in this case, group B meningococcal disease.  Researchers also wanted to 
seewhat side effects toddlers have after receiving bivalent rLP2086 compared to a 
pediatric hepatitis A virus (HAV )vaccine. Bivalent rLP2086 is being compared to 
HAV because HAV is already widely used and the sideeffects of HAV are well 
known .

3WHAT HAPPENED DURING THE STUDY?
This study compared 3groups of children to find out if toddlers made immune 
system proteins, called antibodies, after taking bivalent rLP2086 , and how the side 
effects compared to taking HAV plus placebo .A placebo does not have any medicine 
in it, but looks just like the medicine.
Children in both age groups were put into 1 of 3 study groups by chance alone.  This 
is known as a “randomized” study, and is done to reduce differences between the 
study groups.  Reducing dif ferences between groups makes comparing the groups 
more fair.
In 2 of the 3 groups, children received the experi mental vaccine bivalent rLP2086. 
One group received a 60 µg dose of bivalent rLP2086, and the second group received 
a120µg dose. The third group received HAV and a placebo.  About 64% (6 out of 
10) of children received bivalent rLP2086 and 33% (3 of 10) received HAV plus 
placebo. Researchers use da placebo to see if the study medicine is safe and works 
better than not taking anything.
The s tudy included children who were age d12 months to less than 24 months.
This study was done in two stages. In Stage 1 ,your child was followed for about 
18months.  During Stage 1, each child received 3 injections, at one of two differen t
dose levels (60 µg or 120 µg) of inve stigational bivalent rLP2086, or HAV and 
placebo. The injections were given at:
Visit 1 (Day 1)
Visit 4 (Month 2) .Children who were randomized to receive HAV receive da 
placebo (sterile saline) injection at this visit .
Visit 6 (M onth 6)
Only children who were originally randomized to the bivalent rLP2086 group in 
Stage 1 were eligible to be enrolled in Stage 2 of the study.  In Stage 2 ,your child was 
followed for about 2 years.  This stage measured how long the immune response 
lasted after the third vaccination with bivalent rLP2086.

4While patients were only in thethe study for about 18 months , stage 1 of the study 
took 2 years to complete.  Patients joined the study at 1 of 25locations in Australia, 
Czechia, Finland, and Poland.   It began 31 August 2015 and is ongoing .  396 children 
participated.   All children were between the ages of 12 months and 24 months . 
Children were supposed to be treated until all vac cinations had been given . Of the 396
children who started the st udy, 381 completed the study .  15 did not finish the study.

5All 15 children left before the study was over by their parent’s choice or because a 
doctor decided it was best for thechild to stop the study.
In August 2017 ,the Sponsor began reviewing the information collected.  The Sponsor 
then cr eated a report of the results. This is a summary of that report.
WHAT WERE THE RESULTS OF THE STUDY?
Did the vaccine produce an immune response ?
Yes.  On average, the vaccine produced an immune response in all groups of the 
study.
The first goal of the study was t o see what would happen to the children’s immune 
response to the meningococcal B vaccine 4 weeks after the last vaccination.  
Researchers measured the levels of 4 types of an immune system protein (called MnB 
antibody) and determined whether the vaccine produced an immune response.
Researchers wanted to know how many children had an immune response to the 
vaccine.  
Researchers looked at two different age gro ups when lookin g at the results: children 
aged 12 to less than 18 months, and children aged 18 to 24 months.
Inthe 60 µg dose group, 92% of the children aged 12 to 18 mont hs produced an 
immune response , and 90% of the children aged 18 to 24 months produced an 
immune res ponse. 
In the 120 µg dose group, 87 % of the children aged 12 to 18 months produced an
immune response, and 86 % of the children aged 18 to 24 months produced an 
immune response.

How  did the side effects of taking bivalent rLP2086 compare 
to taking HAV plus placebo ?
The second main goal of the study was to see how the side effects of taking bivalent 
rLP2086 compared to taking HAV plus placebo.
Overall, children receiving rLP2086 had more reactions than those receiving HAV.  
However, these reactions were non -serious medical problems, whic h meant children 
could continue the study even after experiencing these reactions.  The table in the 
next section describes some of these reactions.
There was no major difference in the type or severity of reactions between the 
different age groups.  The r esearchers determined that both the 60 µg and 120 µg 
dose of bivalent rLP2086 are safe for children aged 12 to 24 months.
This does not mean that everyone in this study had these results . Other studies may 
produce different results , as well .  These are ju st some of the main findings of the 
study, and more information may be available at the websites listed at the end of this 
summary.   
WHAT MEDICAL PROBLEMS DID PATIENTS
HAVE DURING THE STUDY ?
The researchers recorded any medical problems the children had during the study. 
Children could have had medical problems for reasons not related to the study (for 
example, caused by an underlying disease or by chance). Or, medical problems could 
090177e1905cbe79\Approved\Approved On: 14-Feb-2019 10:25 (GMT)
7have been caused by a study vaccine , or by another medicine the childwas taking. 
Sometimes the cause of a medical problem is unknown. By comparing medical 
problems across many study groups in many studies, doctors try to underst and what 
the side effects of an experimental vaccine might be.
365out of 396patients (92% ) in this study had at least 1 medical problem .  The most 
common medical problems reported by pa rticipants in this study are listed below.

WERE THERE ANY SERIOUS MEDICAL 
PROBLEMS ?
A medical problem is considered “serious” when it is life -threatening, needs hospital 
care, or causes lasting problems.  
31patients ( 8%) had serious medical problems .  2patients in the 60 µg dose group, 15
patients in the 120 µg dose group, and 5patients in the HAV /placebo group had 
some type of infection .  Nopatients died during the study.  The researchers 
determined that the serious medical problems were not related to the experimental 
vaccine.
