 
 1 CLINICAL TRIAL RESULTS  
 
This summary reports the results of only one study.  Researchers must look at the 
results of many types of studies to understand if a study medicine works, how it 
works, and if it is safe to prescribe to patients .  The results of this study might be 
differ ent than the results of other studies that the researchers review.

 2 WHY WAS THIS STUDY DONE?  
Rheumatoid arthritis, or RA, is a disease that causes swelling, pain, and stiffness in the 
joints.  RA is an autoimmune disease, which means that patients with RA have an 
overactive immune system that mistakenly attacks healthy parts of the body, such as 
the joints.  RA can cause permanent damage to th e joints if it goes unchecked . 
There are medicines that can be used to treat RA.  One medicine that is approved for 
treatment of RA  is called HUMIRA® (in this document HUMIRA® is also called  
adalimumab) .  Adalimumab may help calm the activity of the immune  system and 
decrease RA symptoms.  
PF-06410293 is a new medicine being studied for RA.  PF -06410293 was made to be 
similar to adalimumab.  The reason for making a drug that is similar to adalimumab is 
to help give patients access to  another treatment option .    
This main purpose of this study was to learn more about using PF -06410293 to treat 
RA, compared to adalimumab , and to determine if the 2 medicines are similar .  The 
researchers wanted to answer this question:  
• How many patients who took PF-06410293  had at least 
20% improvement in RA symptoms at week 12 of the study, compared 
to patients who took adalimumab?  
WHAT HAPPENED DURING THE STUDY?  
This study compared 2 groups of patients to learn more about using PF -06410293 to 
treat RA, compared to adalimumab .   
The study included adult patients with moderate to severe RA.  All the patients in this 
study were already taking another medicine for RA called methotrexate (MTX), but 
still had RA symptoms.  
   
 3 First, the patients were screened by the study doctor to make sure they were a good fit 
to join the study.  Next, patients w ere assigned to 1 of 2 treatment groups:  
• 297 patients were assigned to receive PF-06410293 plus MTX  
• 300 patients were assigned to receive adalimumab plus MTX   
PF-06410293 and adalimumab were given as an injection under the skin.  The study 
doctor or nurse showed the patients how to do the injection, then the patients were to 
give themselves the injections at home.  The dose was 40 milligrams (mg) every other 
week.  In addition, the patients were required to continue taking MTX as prescribed 
by the doctor.  
The patients and researchers did not know who took PF -06410293 and who took  
adalimumab.  This is known as a “blinded” study.  Patients  were picked for each 
treatment by chance alone . 
There were 4 parts to this study:  
• Treatment period 1 started with the fir st dose of study drug and ended during 
week 26.  
• Treatment period 2 started during week 26 and ended during week 52.  At the 
beginning of this treatment period, patients from the adalimumab group were 
randomly assigned to either continue taking adalimumab o r switch to 
PF-06410293.  
• Treatment period 3 started during week 52 and ended during week 78.  At the 
beginning of this treatment period, all the remaining patients in the 
adalimumab group were switched to PF -06410293.  
• Follow -up period for 16 weeks after th e last dose of study drug . 
The figure on the following page  shows what happened during this study.

While patients were only in the study for  up to 92 weeks  (treatment plus follow -up), 
the entire study took  about 2 ½ years  to complete.  Patients  joined the study at 1 of  
151 locations in  24 countries  in Africa, Asia, Australia/New Zealand, Europe, North 
America, and South America.   The first patient  joined the study on  25 June 2015 and 
 
 5 the last patient  finished the study on 06 December  2017.  A total of 470 women  and 
127 men joined the study.    
Patients we re supposed to receive study treatment for 76 weeks  and come to a 
follow -up visit 16 weeks later .  A total of  597 patients  started the study, but 1 patient 
did not receive study treatment.  Of the 596 remaining patients, 474 (80%) completed  
all 3 treatment periods .  122 patients  (20%) did not finish the study by their choice or 
because a doctor decided it was best that they leave the study.    
When the study ended in December 2017 , the Sponsor began reviewing the 
information collected.  The Sponsor then created a report of the results.  This is a 
summary of that report.  
WHAT WERE THE RESULTS OF THE STUDY?  
How many patients who took PF -06410293 had at least 20% 
improvement in RA symptoms at week 12 of the study, 
compared to patients who took adalimumab?  
At week 12 of the study, 204 out of 297 (69%) patients in the PF -06410293 group had 
at least 20% improvement in RA symptoms.  At week 12 of the study, 218 out of 300 
(73%) patients in the adalimumab group had at least 20% improvement in RA 
symptoms.  These results were comparable for patients in both groups.  
The chart on the following page  shows the results of the study.

This does not mean that everyone in this study had these results.  Other studies may 
produce different results, as well.  These are just some of the main finding s of the 
study, and more information may be available at the websites listed at the end of this 
summary.   
WHAT MEDICAL PROBLEMS DID PATIENTS  
HAVE DURING THE STUDY?  
The researchers recorded any medical problems the pa rticipants  had during the study. 
Participants  could have had medical problems for reasons not related to the study (for 
example, caused by an underlying disease or by chance).   Medical problems could 
have also been caused by a study treatment, or by another medicine the pa rticipant  
was taking.  Sometimes the cause of a medical problem is unknown.  By comparing 
medical problems across many treatment groups in many studies, doctors try to 
understand what the side  effects of an experimental drug might be . 
During treatment period 1, which included 5 96 patients , 279 patients  (47%) had at 
least 1 non -serious medical problem (that means a medical problem that is not 
life-threatening, does not cause lasting problems, or  does not need hospital care).  
Viral infection of the nose, throat, and upper airways happened in 39 participants 
(7%) during treatment period 1.  
 
 7 During treatment period 2, which included 5 51 patients , 233 patients  (42%) had at 
least 1 non -serious medical  problem (that means a medical problem that is not 
life-threatening, does not cause lasting problems, or does not need hospital care).  
Viral infection of the nose, throat, and upper airways happened in 26 pa tients  (5%) 
during treatment period 2.  
During tr eatment period 3, which included 505 pa tients , 215 pa tients  (43%)  had at 
least 1 non -serious medical problem (that means a medical problem that is not 
life-threatening, does not cause lasting problems, or does not need hospital care).  
Common cold happened  in 26 pa tients  (5%) and worsening RA happened in 
28 patients  (6%) during treatment period 3.  
Over the 3 treatment periods, a  total of 31 patients (5%) left the study because of 
medical problems.  
WERE THERE ANY SERIOUS MEDICAL 
PROBLEMS?  
A medical problem  is considered “serious” when it is life -threatening, needs hospital 
care, or causes lasting problems.   
During treatment period 1, 25 patients (4%) had a serious medical problem.  During 
treatment period 2, 13 patients (2%) had a serious medical pr oblem.  During 
treatment period 3, 21 patients (4%) had a serious medical problem.  
2 participants passed away during this study.  The study doctors determined that one 
of deaths was related to the study drug, and one of the deaths was not related to the 
study drug.

Please remember that researchers look at the results of many studies to find out which 
medicines work best and are safest for patients .  
Again, thank you  for volunteering.
