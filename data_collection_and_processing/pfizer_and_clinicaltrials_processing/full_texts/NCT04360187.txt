Why was this study done?
What is atopic dermatitis ?
Atopic dermatitis is a common skin condition that can cause many symptoms, such as 
itching, redness, and a rash that is scaling or oozing.  The symptoms can look 
different on different people.  Atopic dermatitis is also known as eczema.   People 
with atopic dermatitis often have this condition for many years, and may have “flare 
ups”, when their symptoms worsen for a time.  
What is crisaborole ?
Crisaborole is a medicine that is used to treat atopic dermatitis.  It is applied to the 
skin as an ointment twice a day.  Crisaborole may improve symptoms of atopic 
dermatitis by decreasing inflammation in the skin.  Inflammation is the body’s 
immune system response, which can lead to symptoms such as redness .
What was the purpose of this study?
The purpose of the study was to see if the symptoms of mild to moderate atopic 
dermatitis were reduced when crisaborole ointment was applied twice a day to the 
affected area compared to when a vehicle ointment was used.  The vehicle ointment 
does not have a ny medicine in it, but it looks and feels just like the crisaborole 
ointment.  
Crisaborole is a licensed treatment for atopic dermatitis in adults and children in some 
countries (United States, Canada, China, Israel, and Australia) .  This study was 
conducted in China and Japan to allow data to be collected in these countries .

Researchers wanted to know:
Did the symptoms of atopic dermatitis in adults and children 
2years and older reduce in areas of skin treated with crisaborole, 
and did the condition get better compared to areas of skin treated 
with vehicle ointment?
What happened during the study?
How was the study done?
Researchers tested crisaborole ointment on adults and children 2 years and older in 
China and Japan to find out if participants who were treated with crisaborole had 
fewer symptoms of mild to moderate atopic dermatitis compared to participants who 
used a vehicle ointment.  
Participants went to the study center to be screened by the study doctor to make sure 
they were able to join the study.  This was known as the “screening period” and this 
lasted up to 35 days.  Participants then entered the treatment period, which started on 
Day 1 and lasted 28 days.  During the treatment period, participants (or thei r parents 
or caregivers if the participant was a child) were to apply the ointment twice a day to 
an area or areas of skin affected by the atopic dermatitis.  Treatment was to be 
continued even if the participant had no symptoms of atopic dermatitis.
The s tudy participants and researchers did not know who used the crisaborole 
ointment and who used the vehicle ointment.  The study staff who looked at the 
participant’s skin to assess how the treatment was working also did not know what 
treatment each particip ant had been given.  This is known as an “ double -blinded” 
study.  Study participants were assigned to treatment with crisaborole ointment or 
vehicle ointment by chance alone.  This was done to make sure that the study results 
were not influenced in any way .

Each participant visited the study center on Day 1, Day 8, Day 15, Day 22, and 
Day29 for the study doctors to assess their atopic dermatitis and their general health.  
Participants were not treated on or after Day 29 but were to remain in the study un til 
Day 60.  Participants then received a follow -up telephone call on Day 36 and on 
Day60 (or a month after their last treatment if the participant stopped treatment 
early).  This telephone call was to check for any medical problems.  This was 
considered the end of the study.
The following figure shows what happened during this study.

A total of 205men and boys participated
A total of 186women and girls participated
All participants were between the ages of 2 and71years.
Participants were to be treated for 28 days. Of the 391participants who were treated
with crisaborole or vehicle ointment , 353 out of the 391 participants, or 90%, finished 
study treatment . There were 345out of the 391 participants , or 88%, who finished 
the follow -up part of the study (some of these participants stopped treatment early
while others completed the study treatment part ).
There were 38 participants ( 38 out of 391, or 10%) who did not finish treatment with 
crisaborole or vehicle ointment because of:
Medical problems (20 participants [5%])
Lack of an effect (9 participants [2%])
The participant or their parent or guardian wanted to stop treatment 
(6participants [2% ]and 2 participants [ 1%], respectively ), or 
The doctor decided this was best for the participant (1 participant 
[lessthan 1%]). 
There was 1 participant (1 out of 391, or less than 1%) who entered the follow -up 
phase of the study but who did not complete the follow -up part of the study .  The 
study site tried to contact this participant but was not able to do so.  
How long did the study last?
Study participants were in the study for about 3 months .  The entire study took
around 13½ months to complete.
When the study ended in September 2021, the Sponsor began reviewing the 
information collected.  The Sponsor then created a report of the results.  This is a 
summary of that report.

What were the results of the study?
Did the symptoms of atopic dermatitis in adults and children 2 years 
and older reduce in areas of skin treated with crisaborole, and did the 
condition improve compared to areas of skin treated with vehicle 
ointment ?
To answer this question, the researchers us ed a clinical tool to rate the severity of 
symptoms of atopic dermatitis.  This tool is called the Eczema Area and Severity 
Index or EASI.  The researchers compared the severity of symptoms from before 
participants started treatment to Day 29.  This gave t he researchers the least square 
mean percent change in EASI score from the start of the study on Day 1 to Day 29.  
Least square mean is a special way of calculating the average in certain types of 
statistical analysis.  The least square mean percent change in EASI score from 
Baseline to Day 29 tells the researchers how the participant’s atopic dermatitis had 
changed after 28 days of treatment in this study.
Did crisaborole help to improve the symptoms of atopic dermatitis 
compared to vehicle ointment ?
On a verage, participants who used crisaborole had a least square mean percent 
decrease in total EASI score at Day 29 of 60% compared to 43% in participants 
who used the vehicle ointment.

Based on these results, the researchers have decided that th ese are not likely the 
result of chance.  The study medication may help improve the symptoms of atopic 
dermatitis .  
This does not mean that everyone in this study had these results.  This is a summary 
of just some of the main results of this study.  Other s tudies may have different 
results.
What medical problems did participants have during 
the study?
The researchers recorded any medical problems the participants had during the study.  
Participants could have had medical problems for reasons not related to the study (for 
example, caused by an underlying disease or by chance). Or,medical problems could 
also have been caused by a study treatment or by another medicine the participant was 
taking. Sometimes the cause of a medical problem is unknown. By comparing 
medical problems across many treatment groups in many studies, doctors try to 
understand what effects a study medication might have on a participant.

A total of 178 out of 391 (46%) participants in this study had at least 1 medical 
problem.   There was 20out of the 391 participants, or 5%, who stopped using the 
study medicat ion permanently or left the study because of medical problems.  The 
most common medical problems –are described below.
Below are instructions on how to read Table 1. 
Instructions for Understanding Table 1. 
The 1stcolumn of Table 1lists medical problems that were commonly 
reported during the study.  All medical problems reported by 8 or more 
participants are listed.
The 2ndcolumn tells how many of the 260participants using 
crisaborole ointment reported each medical problem.  Next to this 
number is the percentage of the 260 participants using crisaborole 
ointment who reported the medical problem. 
The 3rdcolumn tells how many of the 131participants using the 
vehicle ointment reported each medical problem.  Next to this number 
is the percentage of the 131participants using the vehicle ointment 
who reported the medical problem.
Using these instructions, you can see that 34out of the
260(13%) participants using crisaborole ointment reported pain where 
the ointment was applied.   A total of 5 out of the 131 (4%) participants 
using the vehicle ointment reported pain where the ointment was 
applied .

Did study participants have any serious medical 
problems?
A medical problem is considered “serious” when it is life -threatening, needs hospital 
care, or causes lasting problems.
Two (2) participants ( 1%, or 2out of 391participants) had serious medical problems.  
One (1) participant using the crisaborole ointment had car pel tunnel syndrome
that w orsened .  Carpel tunnel syndrome is a condition that causes pain , 
tingling , and numbness in the hands and fingers .  This serious medical problem 
happened just after treatment had finished and the participant got better .  The 
doctor and the researcher did not think this was related to the study ointment .
One (1) participant using the vehicle ointment had a laboratory test result that 
showed higher than normal levels of a heart protein in the blood .  This
suggested there was some damage to the heart .  This serious medical pr oblem 
happened after treatmen t had finished and the participant got better .  The 
doctor and the researcher did not think this was related to the study ointment .
No participants died during the study.
