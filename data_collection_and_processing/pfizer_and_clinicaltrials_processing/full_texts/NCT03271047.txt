Date(s) of this Report: 20December 2021; amended 30 May 2022–Thank You –
If you participated in this study, Pfizer, the Sponsor, would like to thank you for your 
participation. 
This summary will describe the study results.  If you have any questions about the 
study or the results, please contact the doctor or staff at your study site.Why was this study done?
What is colorectal cancer ?
Colorectal cancer is cancer that starts in the large intestine (colon) or the rectum (last 
part of the large intestine).  Participants in this study had metastatic colorectal cancer, 
which me ans that the cancer had spread outside of the colon or rectum. Additionally, 
the participants in this study had tumors that were considered to be "microsatellite 
stable" (MSS) , and which contained a specific mutated gene called RAS that can cause 
cancer c ells to grow and to spread. 
What are binimetinib, nivolumab, and ipilimumab ?
There were 3 treatments tested in this study: binimetinib , nivolumab, and ipilimumab.  
Binimetinib is a treatment that may block the growth and spread of cancer.  
Binimetinib is taken as a tablet by mouth .In this study, binimetinib was an 
investigational treatment, which means that it is still being tested and has not been 
approved for use in patients with colorectal cancer.
Nivolumab and ipilimumab are 2 types of antibody t reatments that may help the 
immune system to fight cancer.  Nivolumab and ipilimumab are given through a 
needle into the vein (IV). In this study, nivolumab and ipilimumab were 
investigational treatments .
What was the purpose of this study?
The main purposes of this study were to learn more about the safety of binimetinib, 
nivolumab, and ipilimumab and to determine the recommended dose for further 
testing, and to learn whether binimetinib, nivolumab, and ipilimumab had positive 
effects for pa tients with metastatic colorectal cancer with RAS mutations and that are 
MSS. Researchers wanted to know:
Part 1 :did participants have dose -limiting toxicities?
Part 2: did participants have a reduction in tumor size?
“Dose -limiting toxicities” (DLTs) are certain medical problems caused by taking study 
treatment which require the participant to lower the dose or stop taking the treatment 
(permanently or temporarily). Researchers collect information on DLTs to help 
determine the recommended dose of a study treatment.
What happened during the study? 
How was the study done?
This study was an open -label study, which means that participants and doctors knew 
what medicines were given to participants. This study was done in 2 parts .
Part 1 
The purpose of P art 1 was to find the recommended dose of binimetinib to study in 
Part 2.  During Part 1, participants were assigned to 1 of 2 treatment groups, 
Group 1A and Group 1B.  Group 1A participants received the following treatments: 
Binimetinib 45 milligram s(mg) twice daily by mouth for 4 weeks; if this dose 
level of binimetinib had DLTs, the following lower dose levels of binimetinib 
were tested in order as follows: 
o45 mg twice daily for 3 weeks then 1 week off 
o30 mg twice daily for 4 weeks 
o30 mg twice d aily for 3 weeks then 1 week off 
Nivolumab 480 mg IV over 30 minutes every 4 weeksResearchers used the results from Group 1A to determine the recommended dose to 
test in Group 1B.  After Group 1A completed study treatment, other participants 
started Grou p 1B.  Group 1B participants received the following treatments:
Binimetinib 45 milligram (mg) twice daily by mouth for 4 weeks; if this dose 
level of binimetinib had DLTs, the following lower dose levels of binimetinib 
were tested in order as follows: 
o45 mg twice daily for 3 weeks then 1 week off 
o30 mg twice daily for 4 weeks 
o30 mg twice daily for 3 weeks then 1 week off 
Nivolumab 480 mg IV over 30 minutes every 4 weeks 
Ipilimumab 1 mg per kilogram (kg) (1 mg/kg) IV over 30 minutes about every 
8 weeks
Participants received study treatments in cycles that lasted 28 days.  Participants were 
to attend visits at the study center on Days 1, 15, and 22 of the first cycle, and on 
Days 1 and 15 of the following cycles.  They were also asked to attend an end of 
treatment visit within 2 weeks of stopping study treatment, and attend follow -up visits 
30 days and 100 days after stopping treatment.  They were then contacted by phone 
150 days after stopping study treatment, and every 12 weeks until the study ended.
Thefigure below shows what happened during Part 1.Part 2
During Part 2 of the study, participants were randomly assigned to 1 of 2 treatment 
groups, Group 2A and Group 2B. Randomly means that participants were assigned 
to the treatment groups by chance, like a flip of a coin.  Participants had an equal 
chance of being in Group 2A or Group 2B. 
Group 2A participants received the following treatments:
Binimetinib at the recommended dose from Part 1, given twice a day by mouth 
for 4 weeks
Nivolumab 480 mg IV over 30 minutes every 4 weeks
Group 2B participants received the following treatments:
Binimetinib at the recommended dose from Part 1, twice a day by mouth for 4 
weeks
Nivolumab 480 mg every 4 weeks IV over 30 minutes on Day 1 of each 
treatment cycle
Ipilimumab 1 mg/kg IV over 30 minutes about every 8 weeks 
Participants received study treatments in cycles that lasted 28 days.  Participants were 
to attend visits at the study center on Days 1, 15, and 22 of the first cycle, and on 
Days 1 and 15 of the following cycles.  They were also asked to attend an end of 
treatment visit within 2 weeks of stopping study treatment, and attend follow -up visits 
30 days and 100 days after stopping t reatment.  They were then contacted by phone 
150 days after stopping study treatment, and every 12 weeks until the study ended .
The figure below shows what happened during Part 2.Where did this study take place? 
The Sponsor ran this study at 22 locatio ns in 5 countries (Belgium, the Netherlands, 
Spain, the United Kingdom, and the United States) .
When did this study take place?
It began 18 October 2017 and ended 25 February 2021 .
Who participated in this study?
The study included participants who:
Were a t least 18 years of age
Had metastatic colorectal cancer that was microsatellite stable
Had RAS mutation
Had received at least 1 but no more than 2 prior systemic treatments 
(treatments that travel through the blood cells to all over the body) for 
colorect al cancer, and were either unable to tolerate the treatment or had 
unsatisfactory results
Had never received certain other treatments for colorectal cancer
A total of 75 participants enrolled in the study and received study treatment.  During 
Part 1, there were 10 participants in Group 1A and 11 participants in Group 1B.  
During Part 2, there were 27 participants in Group 2A and 27 participants in 
Group 2B.
The participants included:
A total of 48 men participated
A total of 27 women participated
53 participants were less than age 65 years old
22 participants were age 65 years old or older
Participants could continue receiving study treatment until their colorectal cancer got 
worse (up to a maximum of 2 years for nivolumab and ipilimumab) .  Of the 
75participants who started the study:
1 (3% )participant who received binimetinib + nivolumab completed the study 
through the follow -up part of the study
5 (13% )participants who received binimetinib + nivolumab + ipilimumab
completed the study through the follow -up part of the study
36 (97%) participants who took binimetinib + nivolumab did not finish the study 
because they:
Passed away: 28 (76%) participants
Withdrew consent: 5 (1 4%) participants
Were lost to follow -up: 3 ( 8%) participants33 (87%) participants who took binimetinib + nivolumab + ipilimumab did not finish 
the study because they:
Passed away: 29 (76%) participants
Withdrew consent: 2 (5%) participants
Were lost to follow -up: 1 (3%) participant
Other reason: 1 (3%) participant
How long did the study last?
The entire study took about 3 years and 4months to complete.
When the study ended in February 2021, the Sponsor began reviewing the 
information collected.  The Sponsor then created a report of the results.  Th is is a 
summary of that report.What were the results of the study?
Part 1: did participants have dose -limiting toxicities ?
In Group 1A, 1 out of 9 participants (11%) who received binimetinib + 
nivolumab had a DLT (severe acne -like rash) during the first treatment cycle.  
In Group 1B, 2 out of 11 participants (18%) who received binimetinib + 
nivolumab + ipilimumab had DLTs during the first treatment cycle 
(1participant had colitis and 1 part icipant had blurry vision, rash, and 
inflammation in lungs).  
Using this information, the researchers determined that 45 mg twice per day was the 
recommended dose of binimetinib for further testing.
Part 2: did participants have a reduction in tumor size?
To answer this question, the researchers looked at the percentage of 
participants with either a complete response to study treatment (all tumors 
disappeared), or a partial response to study treatment (at least a 30% decrease 
in tumors).
Out of 27 particip ants in Group 2A, no participants (0%) had a complete 
response or a partial response to study treatment.
Out of 27 participants in Group 2B, no participants (0%) had a complete 
response, and 2 participants (7%) had a partial response to study treatment
This means that the study results did not show that the study treatments had 
positive effects for participants with RAS mutant, MSS colorectal cancer.
This does not mean that everyone in this study had these results.  This is a summary 
of just some of the mai n results of this study.  Other studies may have different 
results.What medical problems did participants have during 
the study?
The researchers recorded any medical problems the participants had during the study.  
Participants could have had medical problems for reasons not related to the study (for 
example, caused by an underlying disease or by chance).  Or, medical problems could
also have been caused by a study treatment or by another medicine the participant was 
taking.  Sometimes the cause of a medical problem is unknown.  By comparing 
medical problems across many treatment groups in many studies, doctors try to 
understand what effects a study medication might have on a participant.
Below are instructions for understanding Table 1.All 75 participants (100%) treated in this study had at least 1 medical problem.  A total 
of 16(21%) participants stopped taking study treatment because of medical problems.  
The most common medical problems –those reported by at least 15%of participants 
in any group –are described below.Instructions for Understanding Table 1. 
The 1stcolumn of Table 1 lists medical problems that were 
commonly reported during the study.  All medic al problems reported 
by at least 15% of participants are listed.
The 2ndcolumn tells how many of the 37 participants taking 
binimetinib + nivolumab reported each medical problem.  Next to 
this number is the percentage of the 37 participants taking binimet inib 
+ nivolumab who reported the medical problem. 
The 3rdcolumn tells how many of the 38 participants taking 
binimetinib + nivolumab + ipilimumab reported each medical 
problem.  Next to this number is the percentage of the 38 participants 
taking binimeti nib + nivolumab + ipilimumab who reported the 
medical problem.
Using these instructions, you can see that 20 out of the 37 participants 
(54%) taking binimetinib + nivolumab reported diarrhea.  A total of 
19out of the 38 participants (50%) taking binimetini b + nivolumab + 
ipilimumab reported diarrhea.Table 1. Commonly reported medical problems by study participants

problems?
A medical problem is considered “serious” when it is life-threatening, needs hospital 
care, or causes lasting problems.
34out of 75(45%) participants had serious medical problems , including 
17participants (46%) who received binimetinib + nivolumab, and 17 participants 
(45%) who received binimetinib + nivo lumab + ipilimum ab.  The most common 
serious medical problems were:
Fever: 2 participants (5%) who received binimetinib + nivolumab
Fluid build -up around the heart: 2 participants (5%) who received binimetinib 
+ nivolumab
Lung infection: 2 participants ( 5%) who received binimetinib + nivolumab+ 
ipilimumab
Inflammation in lungs: 2 participants (5%) who received binimetinib + 
nivolumab+ ipilimumab
Fluid build -up around the lungs: 2 participants (5%) who received binimetinib 
+ nivolumab+ ipilimumab
57partic ipants (76%) died during this study.   7 of these participants (9%) died during 
study treatment or within 30 days of stopping study treatment. Most of the deaths 
were due to colorectal cancer. The study doctors did not consider any of the deaths 
to be rel ated to taking study treatments.Where can I learn more about this study?
