CLINICAL TRIAL RESULTS
This summary reports the results of only one study.  Researchers must look at the 
results of many types of studies to understand if a study medicine works, how it 
works, and if it is safe to prescribe to patients.  The results of this study might be 
different than the results of other studies that the researchers review.

3WHY WAS THIS STUDY DONE?
Diffuse Large B -Cell Lymphoma (or “DLBCL”) is a kind of non -Hodgkin lymphoma.  
It is the most common type of blood cancer.  DLBCL happen swhen cells of the 
immune system, known as B -cells, grow and multiply uncontrollably.  DLBCL occurs 
mostly in adults and is a fast -growing (aggressive) lymphoma.  While there are 
treatments available for DLBCL, some patients’ cancer does not get better or gets 
worse over time.  Researchers are looking for new and better treatments that can be 
combined with other medicines to help keep patients’ DLBCL from getting worse 
over time.
Avelumab and utomilumab were investigational treatments for DLBCL when this 
study began.  Bot h of these treatments are a type of protein called “monoclonal 
antibodies”, and they are thought to work by helping the cells of the immune system 
fight cancer cells.  Although avelumab is approved for use in other types of cancer 
under the brand name Bave ncio®, it is not approved for use in DLBCL.
The medicines rituximab, azacitidine, and bendamustine are commonly used to treat 
DLBCL, but these medicines may not work well for all patients.  Patients who’s 
DLBCL did not get better with approved cancer treat ments are said to have 
“refractory” DLBCL.  Patients whose DLBCL got better after treatment but later got 
worse are said to have “relapsed” DLBCL.
This study was divided into 2 parts, or “phases”.  The main purpose of the first phase 
of the study (Phase 1) was to learn about the effects of avelumab when given with 
other investigational or approved cancer therapies.  This information would determine 
the best treatment combination to use in the second phase of the study (Phase 3).  To 
do this, the researchers asked:
How many dose -limiting toxicities, or “DLTs”, did patients have when 
taking avelumab with other therapies?
DLTs are certain medical problems caused by taking avelumab which require 
the patient to lower the dose or stop taking the medicine temporari ly or 
permanently.
How many patients had their DLBCL get better when taking avelumab 
with other therapies?
To do this, the researchers looked to see if the patients’ tumors got smaller 
after taking the study medications.

4WHAT HAPPENED DURING THE STUDY?
This study compared 3 groups of patients taking avelumab with other investigational 
and approved cancer medications to see what DLTs the patients had, and to see if 
their DLBCL improved.
The study included adult patients with relapsed or refractory DLBCL w ho met the 
following conditions:
They had completed at least 2 (but no more than 4) cycles of treatment with 
rituximab and chemotherapy, with or without a stem cell transplant.  If they 
were not eligible to be treated with a stem cell transplant and/or int ensive 
chemotherapy (for example, due to medical problems), they must have 
completed 1 cycle of treatment with rituximab and chemotherapy.
They did not have evidence of cancer in the brain or spinal cord.
They had not received an organ transplant.
They had not been treated before with certain monoclonal antibody 
medications or non -drug anti -cancer therapies.
They had not received any anti -cancer therapy in the 2 weeks before starting 
the study medications.
Patients were put into 1 of the 3 treatment groups by chance alone.  This is known as 
a “randomized” study.  This is done to make the groups more similar and more even 
to compare.  The patients and researchers knew which medications the patients were 
takin g.  This is known as an “open -label” study.   The medications given to each 
treatment group are shown in the table below.  All medications were given through a 
needle into a vein (intravenous) except for azacitidine, which was given by injection 
under the skin (subcutaneous).

5A diagram of the study is shown below.
This study took 3 years to complete.  The Sponsor ran this study at 15 locations in
5countries in Europe, the United States , and Australi a.  It began 16 December 2016 
and ended on 02 December 2 019.  A total of 24 men and 5 women participated.   Ten 
(10) patients were under the age of 65 and 19 patients were 65 years of age or older. 
Patients were to be treated until the patient or their doctor decided it was best for 
them to stop treatment.  Of the29 patients who started the study, no patients finished 
thefirst phase of the study .  The most common reason for patients leaving the study 
wasbecause their DLBCL got worse.  Two (2) patients left before the study was over 
by their choice or a doctor decided it was best for a patient to stop being in the study .

6The study was stopped before the second phase (Phase 3) began . Group A and 
Group B were closed to enrollment in May 2018, due to less than 2 patients in these 
groups having their DLBCL get bet ter.  Enrollment in Group C was closed in 
September 2018 due to lack of new patients enrolling in the study.
When the study ended in December 2019, the Sponsor reviewed the information 
collected.  The Sponsor then created a report of the results.  This is a summary of that 
report.
WHAT WERE THE RESULTS OF THE STUDY?
How m any DLTs did patients have when taking avelumab with 
other therapies?
There was 1 patient in Group A (taking avelumab, utomilumab, and rituximab) who 
hadDLTs.  This patient developed a herpes infection that involved the eyes, which 
the researchers think was related to taking rituximab.  No DLTs were reported in 
Group B or Group C. 
How m any patients had their DLBCL get better when taking 
avelum ab with oth er therapies?
One (1) of the 9 patients in Group A, none of the patients in Group B, and 3 of the 
11 patients in Group C had their DLBCL get better.  These results did not show that 
one treatment was better than another, and could have been due to chance. 
This does not mean that everyone in this study had these results.  Other studies may 
produce different results, as well.  These are just some of the main findings of the 
study, and more information may be available at the websites listed at the end of thi s 
summary.

7WHAT MEDICAL PROBLEMS DID 
PARTICIPANTS HAVE DURING THE STUDY?
The researchers recorded any medical problems the participants had during the study.  
Participants could have had medical problems for reasons not related to the study (for 
example, caused by an underlying disease or by chance).  Or, medical problems could 
also have been caused by a study treatment or by another medicine the participant was 
taking.  Sometimes the cause of a medical problem is unknown.  By comparing 
medical pr oblems across many treatment groups in many studies, doctors try to 
understand what the side effects of an experimental drug might be.
All patients in this study had at least 1 medical problem.  A total o f 4patients stopped 
taking at least 1 study medicin e because of medical problems.  The most common 
medical problems are listed below.

WERE THERE ANY SERIOUS MEDICAL 
PROBLEMS?
A medical problem is considered “serious” when it is life -threatening, needs hospital 
care, or causes lasting problems.   
Sixteen (16) patients (57%) had serious medical problems.   When broken down by 
group, 3 patients in Group A (38%), 6 patients in Group B (67%), and 7 patients in 
Group C (64%) had serious medical problems.  Most serious medical problems 
happened in 1 patient and were not thought to be related to aveluma b treatment.  The 
only serious medical problem reported by 2 or more patients was their DLBCL 
getting worse. A total of 18 patients died during the study, mostly due to their 
DLBCL getting worse.
