1CLINICAL TRIAL RESULTS
This summary reports the results of only one study.  Researchers must look at the 
results of many types of studies to understand if a study medicine works, how it 
works, and if it is safe to prescribe to patients.  The results of this study might be 
differ ent than the results of other studies that the researchers review.

2WHY WAS THIS STUDY DONE?
Prostate cancer is the name for ca ncer that starts in the prostate, which is a small, 
walnut -sized gland that lies at the base of the bladder in men and is part of the male 
reproductive system.
Prostate cancer is a common cancer in men , and it is often a slow -growing cancer 
with few symptoms.
Enzalutamide is a prescription medicine that is approved to treat men with prostate 
cancer.   Enzalutamide work sby interfering with the connections between androgens 
(a type of hormone that plays a role in male traits and reproductivity ) and androgen 
receptors (a protein in the body that attaches to androgens).  This may help to slow 
the growth of prostate cancer.
The main goal of this study was to learn more about the use of enzalutamide in 
patients with prosta te cancer that did not sufficiently improve after r eceiving 
treatment to block androgens. Researchers wanted to answer th is research question:
How long did patients survive without prostate cancer getting worse after 
receiving enzalutamide ,compared to bicalutamide ?
Bicalutamide is a medicine approved to treat men with prostate cancer.   
WHAT HAPPENED DURING THE STUDY?
This study compared 2 groups of patients to find out how long patients would survive
without prostate cancer getting worse after receiving enzalutamid e,compared to 
bicalutamide .  The study included patients who had prostate cancer that did not 
sufficiently improve after receiving treatment to block androgens.  These patients had 
either mild prostate cancer symptoms or no prostate cancer symptoms when the study 
began.
Patients in this study were assigned to receive either enzalutamide or bicalutamide .  
The patients and researchers did not know who took enzalutamide and who took 
bicalutamide .  This is known as a “blinded” study.  Patients were assigned to each 
treatment group by chance alone.  This is known as a “randomized” study.  Putting

3people into groups by chance helps make the groups more similar so they can be 
compared. 
First, patients were checked by a study doctor to make sure they met the req uirements 
to join the study.  This was called the screening period.
During the treatment period, patients received the following treatments:
Group 1: 197patients received enzalutamide at a dose of 160 milligrams (mg), 
taken by mouth each day
Group 2: 198patients received bicalutamide at a dose of 50 mg , taken by 
mouth each day
Patients in both groups also received placebo pills. A placebo does not have any 
active medicine in it, but looks just like the medicine.  The placebo pills were given so 
that both treatments would look the same, and the study would remain blinded.
During the treatment period, p atients came to study visits at week 1, week 5, and 
week 13, then every 12 weeks thereafter.   At the study visits, imaging tests were done 
and patients were checked by study doctors to determine if p rostate cancer was 
getting worse .  Patients were also asked about any medical problems they were having.
After researchers reviewed results from the treatment period ,patients had the option 
to enter the “open -label extension” part of the study.   During this part of the study, 
all patients received enzalutamide and came to study visits at week 1, week 5, week 17, 
and then every 16 weeks thereafter .  “Open -label” means that the patients and 
researchers knew which medicine the patients were taking.   Patients came to a 
follow -up visit 30 days after their last dose of study treatment .  
The figure on the following page shows what happened during this study.

4The amount of time that patients were in the study varied , but the entire study took
more than 5years to complete , including both the main part of the study and the 
open -label extension part of the study .  The sponsor ran this study at 62locations in 
inthe United States .It began 07 August 2012 and ended 17 January 2018 .  396men 
joined the study ,and 395 men received study treatment .  All patients were between 
the ages of 46and 9 2. 
Patients were to continue receiving study treatment until it was confirmed that their 
prostate cancer had gotten wors e.Of the 396patients who started the study,
145patients ( 37%) were still receiving study treatment when the main part of the 
090177e1936afe1a\Approved\Approved On: 27-May-2020 06:01 (GMT)
5study ended in February 2015 .  251patients ( 63%) stopped taking study treatment by 
their choice , because a doctor decided it w as best for a patient to stop the study , 
because they had a medical problem, because prostate cancer got worse ,or because 
they passed away .  A total of 93patients from the enzalutamide group and 37patients 
from the bicalutamide group entered the open -label extension part of the study and 
received enzalutamide .
When the study ended in January 2018, the Sponsor began reviewing the infor mation 
collected.  The Sponsor then cr eated a report of the results. This is a summary of that 
report.
WHAT WERE THE RESULTS OF THE STUDY?
How  long did patients survive without prostate cancer 
getting worse after receiving enzalutamide ,compared to 
bicalutamide ?
To answer this question, the researchers looked at data gathered from the beginning 
of the study until the main part of the study ended in February 2015 .  They looked at 
the median length of time that patients survived without cancer getting worse after 
receiving study treatment .  A “median” is the middle number in a group of numbers.
So, researchers looked at the length of time that each patient survived without cancer 
getting worse , in order from highest to lowest.  The median is the middle number, 
and patients would have the same chance of surviving a longer time or a shorter time 
than this number without cancer getting worse .
During this time, the median length of time that patients survived without cancer 
getting worse after receiving enzalutamide was 19.4 months, while the median length 
of time that patient s survived without cancer getting worse after receiving 
bicalutamide was5.7months . 
The researchers have de termined that these results are clinically meaningful, and not 
likely based o n chance.  The figure on the following page shows th esestudy r esults.

6This does not mean that everyone in this study had these results . Other studies may 
produce different results , as well .  These are just some of the main findings of the 
study, and more information may be available at the websites listed at the end of this 
summary.  
WHAT MEDICAL PROBLEMS DID PATIENTS
HAVE DURING THE STUDY ?
The researchers recorded any medical problems the participant shad during the study. 
Participant s could have had medical problems for reasons not related to the study (for 
example, caused by an underlying disease or by chance). Or, medical problems could 
also have been caused by a study treatment, or by another medicine the participan t
was taking. Sometimes the cause of a medical problem is unknown. By comparing 
medical problems across many treatment groups in many studies, doctors try to 
understand what the side effects of an experimental drug might b e.
369out of 395(93%) patients who received study treatment h ad at least 1 medical 
problem .A total of 58patients (15%) stopped taking study treatment because of 
medical problems.  Out of the 37patient swho took bicalutamide during the main 
part of the study and switched to enzalutamide during the open -label extension part

WERE THERE ANY SERIOUS MEDICAL 
PROBLEMS?
A medical problem is considered “serious” when it is life -threatening, needs hospital 
care, or causes lasting problems .  
136out of 395patients ( 34%) had serious medical problems , including 76patients 
(39%) in the enzalutamide group and 60patients (30%) in the bicalutamide group .  
Out of the 37patients who took bicalutamide during the main part of the study and 
switched to enzalutamide during the open -label extension part of the study, 
16patients ( 43%) had serious medical problems .
A total of 18patients (5%) died during the study , including 11 patients (6%) in the 
enzalut amide group and 6 patients (3%) in the bicalutamide group .  Out of the 
37patients who took bicalutamide during the main part of the study and switched to 
enzalutamide during the open -label extension part of the study, 1 patient (3%) died.  
5of the 18deaths were due to prostate cancer progression , and 13 of these deaths 
were due to a medical problem .
