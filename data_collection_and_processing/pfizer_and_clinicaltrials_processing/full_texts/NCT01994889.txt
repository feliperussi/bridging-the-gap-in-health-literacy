2WHY WAS THIS STUDY DONE?
People with t ransthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy have higher than normal levels of a 
particular protein in their heart .  This increases the risk o f having heart problems ,like
heart failure.
Tafam idis is a study drug that is being tested for the treatment of transthyretin 
amyloid cardiomyopathy . Tafamidis is currently approved to treat transthyretin 
amyloid cardiomyopathy in Japan and the United States . Tafamidis is not approved to 
treat transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy in other countries because it is still being 
tested.
Thisstudy had 2 purposes:
To understand the safety of tafamidis : to see what medical problems patient s
had during the stu dy
To look at controlling transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy : to see if patients 
taking tafamidis were less likely to have a stay in hospital and less likely to die 
earlier because of transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy
WHAT HAPPENED DURING THE STUDY?
This study compared patients who received tafamidis with patients who received
placebo ,to understand if tafam idishelped patients with transthyretin amyloid 
cardiomyopathy . A placebo does not have any medicine in it, but looks just like the 
medicine being studied .
This was a randomized trial ,meaning patients were put randomly (by chance) into 
1of 3 groups: 
Group 1: received a study drug called tafamidis at a dose of 20 milligrams ( mg)
Group 2: received a study drug called tafamidis at a dose of 80 mg
Group 3: received a placebo that didn’t contain any drug 
Putting patients into groups randomly makes comparing the groups more fair.

3The study included patients who had a history of heart failure due to transthyretin 
amyloid cardiomyopathy .  The patient s and researchers did not know who took 
tafamidis and who took the placebo.  This is known as a “blinded” study.  This means 
that neither the patients nor doctors knew which drug the patients actually got.
The study began 09 December 2013 and ended 07 Febr uary 2018 . While patients 
were in the study for 2.5 years (30 months) , the entire study took about 4.5 years to 
complete.  At the end of this study, all patients were offered the possibility to 
continue tafamidis treatment in a separate study to help rese archers collect more data 
on the safety of tafamidis .  
The S ponsor ran this study at 48 locations in 13 countries around the world.  398men 
and 43women participated.  All patients were between the ages of 46and 89.

4Patients were to be treated for 30 months (2.5 years) .Of the 441patients who started 
the study, 258 finished the study .  183patients did not finish the study by their choice 
or a doctor decided it was best for a patient to stop the study ,or because they died 
from causes not related to taking the study drug .
When the study ended in February 2018, the Sponsor began reviewing the 
infor mation collected.  The Sponsor then cr eated a report of the results. This is a 
summary of that report.
WHAT WERE THE RESULTS OF THE STUDY?
Was tafam idis more effective than placebo for treating patients with 
transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy ?
To answer this question, the researchers looked at 2 separate measures: 
How many patients were alive at the end of study?
During the study, how many times was each patient hospitalized for heart 
problems? 
The researchers used a method to determine whether tafamidis treatment was more 
effective than placebo . Thismethod evaluated mortality (how many patients were 
090177e191c192b2\Approved\Approved On: 04-Sep-2019 06:15 (GMT)
5alive at th e end of the study) and heart -related hospitalizations , giving higher priority 
to mortality.  
In the chart below you can see how many patients were alive at the end of the study. 
The higher the bar rises above the thick black line, the more patients survi ved.
186 out of 264 patients (7 0%) taking tafam idis were alive at the end of the 
study. This is shown by the blue column (bar) on the left.
101 out of 177 patients (57%) taking placebo were alive at the end of the study.
This is shown by the white column (bar) on the right.

6In the chart below you can see how many times patients were hospitalized for heart 
problems during the study. The higher the bar rises above the thick black line, the 
greater the number of hospital stays .
On average, patients taking tafamidis were hospitalized for heart problems 
0.48 times per year.  This is shown by the blue column (bar) on the left.
On average, patients taking placebo were hospitalized for heart problems 
0.7times per year .  This is shown by the white column (bar) on the right.
The results of these 2 measures show that in this study, tafam idis was more effective 
than placebo for treating patients with transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy .The 
researchers have concluded that the seresults are not likely the result of chance , 
meaning that they were likely the result of the study drug. 
This does not mean that everyone in this study had these results . Other studies may 
produce different results , as well .  These are just some of the main findings of the 
study, and more information may be available at the websites listed at the end of this 
summary.

7WHAT MEDICAL PROBLEMS DID PATIENTS
HAVE DURING THE STUDY?
The researchers recorded any medical problems the participant shad during the study. 
Participant s could have had medical problems for reasons not related to the study (for 
example, caused by an underlying disease or by chance). Or, medical problems could 
have been caused by a study treatment, or by another medicine the participan twas 
taking. Sometimes the cause of a medical problem is unknown. By comparing 
medical problems across many treatment groups in many studies, doctors try to 
understand what the side effects of an experimental drug might be.
412out of 441patients (93%) in this study had at least 1 medical problem .  In this 
study, the percentage of patients with medical problems was similar in each group:
Tafamidis 20 mg: 99% (87 out of 88 patients) 
Tafamidis 80 mg: 98% (173 out of 176 patients) 
Placebo: 99% (175 out of 177 patients)
Some of the medical problems were determined to be related to the study drug. In 
this study, more patients in the placebo group had medical problems that were 
determined to be related to the study drug, compared to patients in the tafamidis 
groups.
Tafamidis 20 mg: 3 9% (34 out of 88 patients) 
Tafamidis 80 mg: 45% (79 out of 176 patients) 
Placebo: 51% (90 out of 177 patients)

9WERE THERE ANY SERIOUS MEDICAL 
PROBLEMS?
A medical problem is considered “serious” when it is life -threatening, needs hospital 
care, or causes lasting problems .  339out of 441 patients ( 77%) had serious medical 
problems .  A total of 12 patients (3%) had serious medical problems that were 
determined to be related to study treatment, including 3 patients in the tafam idis 
20mg group, 3 patients in the tafam idis 80 mg group, and 6 patients in the placebo 
group.   
Additional ly, information about whether a patient was alive or not was collected at 
30months after the study began.  A total of 144 patients died during this time period , 
including 77 deaths during the study and 67deaths during the follow -up period.  
None of these deaths were determined to be related to study treatment.
