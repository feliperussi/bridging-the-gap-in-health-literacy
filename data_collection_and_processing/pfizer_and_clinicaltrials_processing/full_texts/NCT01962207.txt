2WHY WAS THIS STUDY DONE?
Invasive m eningococcal disease is an illness which maycause a serious infection inthe 
blood, as well as swelling around the brain and spinal cord.  Meningococcal disease is 
more common in children than adults.  Children who get this illness are at risk for 
hearing loss and other disabilities.  However, invasive meningococcal disease may be 
prevented with a v accine.  A vaccine is a type of medic inethat helps people fight off 
germs.
Meningococcal disease is caused by the meningococcus germ.  There are different 
types of this germ.  For example, meningococcal type Adisease is caused by the 
meningococcus Agerm .  MenACWY -TT(Nimenrix) is a vaccine approved in Europe 
for the prevention of meningococcal disease .This vaccine targets 4 common types of 
meningoc occus germ: types A, C, Y, and W -135.  It is given by injection into the 
muscle .  
The main purpose of thi s study was to learn more about the long -term effects of 
Nimenrix in healthy children, compared to 2 other vaccine sagainst meningococcal 
disease, called Meningitec®and Mencevax® ACWY. Meningitec is aimed at 
preventing meningococcal diseases caused by the meningococcus C germ .  Mencevax 
is aimed at preventing meningococcal diseases caused by the menigococcus A, C, Y, 
and W -135 germs.  Researchers wanted to know:
Would children who received Nimenrix still have antibodies against 
meningococcus germ sat 6,7, 8, 9, and 10years after vaccination, 
compared to children who received Meningitec or Mencevax?
To answer thisquestion, researchers collected blood samples from the children.  The 
researchers looked for antibodies in the blood against the 4 different types of 
meningococcus germ.  Antibodies are special proteins that can recognize and help kill 
germs.  These antibodies can protect children from getting sick if they ever do come 
into contact with meningococcus germs.

3WHAT HAPPENED DURING THE STUDY?
This study compared 4groups of children to learn more abou t the long -term effects 
of MenACWY -TT. 
The sponsor asked children who participated in aprevious stud yon Nimenrix to join 
this study .All the children were healthy and had received vaccination with Nimenrix ,
Meningitec , or Mencevax during the previous stud y.
The children were placed in 4 groups (the same groups as the previous study):
Group 1: Children who received Nimenrix when they were between 1 and 
2years old ( 76children)
Group 2: Children who received Meningitec when they were between 1 and
2years old ( 23children)
Group 3: Children who received Nimenrix when they were 2 to 10 years old 
(115children)
Group 4: Children who received Mencevax when they were 2 to 10 years ol d 
(29children)
The children were asked to come to up to 5 visits, each a year apart, at the study 
center.  This was known as the “persistence phase” of the study.  During these visits, 
the researchers collected blood samples from the children.  The resear chers looked 
for antibodies in the blood against the 4 different types of meningococcus germ.   
181 c hildren received a booster dose of Nimenrix at study visit 5. This was known as 
the “booster phase” of the study.
This was an “open label” study, which me ans that the children, their 
parents/guardians, and the researchers knew which vaccine the children received.
The figure on the following page shows what happened during this study.

4Children were in this study for up to 4 years, butthe entire study took a lmost 5 years 
to complete.  Children joined the study at 1 of 9locations in Finland .The first child
joined the study on 09October 2013and the last child finished the study on 11June
2018.  A total of 122girlsand 121boys joined the study .  The children were between 
7 and 1 8years old when the ybegan the study .
Children were supposed to come to up to 5 visits, each a year apart ,at the study 
center. Of the 243children who joined the study, 191(79%) completed it.  A tot al of 
52children (21%) left before the study was over by their parent/guardian’s choice or 
a doctor decided it was best for a patient to stop the study. 
When the study ended in June 2018, the Sponsor began reviewing the information 
collected.  The Sponsor then created a report of the results. This is a summary of that 
report.

5WHAT WERE THE RESULTS OF THE STUDY? 
Did children who received Nimenrix still have antibodies 
against meningococc us germ sat 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10years after 
vaccination, compared to children who received Meningitec
or Mencevax ?
In general, children from the Nimenrix, Meningitec , and Mencevax group sstill had 
antibodies against meningococc usgerm sat each of the study visits .  The amount of 
antibodies in the blood was similar at each study visit.   However, there were fewer 
children in the Meningitec and Mencevax groups than the Nimenrix group s, so the 
results for each group can not be directly comp ared.
The charts below show the the percentage of children in each group who still had a 
certain level of antibodies against meningococcus germs at 6,7,8,9, and 10 years after 
vaccination.   Recall that Meningitec is aimed at preventing meningococcal diseas es 
caused by the meningococcus C germ only, while Mencevax and Nimenrix are aimed 
at preventing meningococcal diseases caused by the menigococcus A, C, Y, and 
W-135 germs .

This does not mean that everyone in this study had these results.  Other studies may 
produce different results, as well.  These are just some of the main findings of the 
study, and more information may be available at the websites listed at the end of this 
summary .  
WHAT MEDICAL PROBLEMS DID CHILDREN
HAVE DURING THE STUDY?
The researchers recorded medical problems the children had during the study.
Children could have had medical problems for reasons not related to the study (for 
example, caused by an underlying disease or by chance).  Or, medical pr oblems could 
also have been caused by a study vaccine , or by another medicine the participant was 
taking.  Sometimes the cause of a medical problem is unknown.  By comparing 
medical problems across many treatment groups in many studies, doctors try to 
unde rstand what the side effects of an experimental drug might be.
Out of 243children who participated in the persistence phase , 2child ren(less than 
1%) left the study because of medical problem .  The study doctors determined that 
thesemedical problem swerenot related to the study vaccine s.
During the booster phase, the researchers recorded medical problems that occurred 
within 31 days of receiving the booster vaccine. Out of 181 children who participated 
in this phase, 59 children (33%) had a medical pr oblem that the study doctors 
determined was related to the vaccine.  This included 16 children (24%) in Group 1,

WERE THERE ANY SERIOUS MEDICAL 
PROBLEMS?
A medical problem is considered “serious” when it is life -threatening, needs hospital 
care, or causes lasting problems .  
1child in this study had a serious medical problem , which the study doctors 
determined was not related to the study vaccine. This medi cal problem was
