Clinical Study Results
This summary reports the results of only one study.  Researchers must look at the 
results of many types of studies to understand if a study medication works, how it 
works, and if it is safe to prescribe to study participants. The results of this study 
might be different than the results of other studies that the researchers review.

Why was this study done?
What is breast cancer?
Breast cancer is the most common cancer in women.  In 2012, about 1.7 million 
women were diagnosed with breast cancer and over 522,000 women died due to the 
disease.  
Some people carry changes or “mutations” in their DNA in genes called breast cancer 
susceptibility (BRCA) genes 1 and 2, or “BRCA1” and “BRCA2”.  BRCA gene 
mutations can be inherited by a child from one of their parents (germline).  When a 
person’s BRCA1 o r BRCA2 genes contain mutations, it can cause breast cancer.  
Researchers are looking for treatments for breast cancer patients with BRCA 
mutations. 
What is talazoparib?
Talazoparib (Talzenna®) is known as a PARP inhibitor.  PARP inhibitors aredrugs
thatarebelieved to inhibit (stop) the normal activity of certain proteins called “Poly 
(ADP -ribose) polymerases”, also called “PARPs”.  PARPs are proteins (made from 
genes which are part of DNA) that are found in all normal and cancer cells that are 
involved in the repair of DNA.  PARPs are needed to repair mistakes that can happen 
in DNA when cells divide.  If the mistakes are not repaired, the cell will usually die 
and be replaced.  Cells with mistakes in their DNA (like cells with BRCA1 and 
BRCA2 gene muta tions) that do not die can become cancer cells.  
Clinical trials have shown that the use of talazoparib, as well as other PARP inhibitors, 
may reduce tumor size and slow tumor growth in patients with certain types of cancer 
with BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations. Talazoparib is given in a capsule and is taken by 
mouth once daily at around the same time every day.  
What was the purpose of this study?
Talazoparib is now approved in the United States, the European Union, and other 
countries for the treatment of people with a certain type of breast cancer (human

epidermal growth factor receptor 2 [HER2] -negative), who have an abnormal 
inherited BRCA gene, and their cancer has spread beyond the original tumor (“locally 
advanced”) or has spread to other parts of the body (“metastatic”).  This study was 
done to see if talazoparib treatment followed by surgery could result in a “pathologic 
complete response” ( complete disappearance of cancer in the breast or underarm 
lymph node tissues at surgery ) in participants with early breast cancer (original 
location) who have inherited a BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene mutation in HER2 negative 
breast cancer.  
Researchers also wan ted to learn more about the safety of talazoparib.  They 
monitored the participants for any medical problems that happened while they were 
in the study.
What happened during the study?
How was the study done?
Participants we re checked (screened) to make sure they were a good fit for the study. 
Participants received 1 milligram (mg) talazoparib once per day by mouth, for 
24weeks (participants with kidney disease received a lower dose, 0.75 mg talazoparib).  
Within 6 weeks of finishing talazoparib treatment, participants had surgery and study 
doctors took tissue samples to evaluate and remove breast cancer.
This was an “open -label” study, which means that the participants and doctors knew 
which treatment and dose they received.   Researchers wanted to know: 
How many participants had a pathologic complete response 
(complete disappearance of cancer at surgery) after 24 weeks of 
treatment with talazoparib followed by surgery? 
090177e1976a02d4\Approved\Approved On: 28-Jun-2021 02:29 (GMT)
Participants joined the study and received talazoparib for 24 weeks and were expected 
to attend a follow -up visit about 4 weeks later. Within 6 weeks of completing 
talazoparib treatment, participants had surgery (if appropriate) followed by another 
follow-up visit 4 weeks later.  Participants were thereafter contacted by phone about 
every 12 weeks for the remainder of the study.
The figure below shows what happened during this study.
Where did this study take place? 
The Sponsor ran this study at 18 locations in the United States.
When did this study take place?
It began on 27 August 2018 and ended 23 September 2020. 
Who participated in this study?
This study included adult participants who:
Had HER2 negative (HER2 is a type of protein receptor that may be on the 
surface of cancer cells) or early invasive triple -negative breast cancer
Had a BRCA 1 or BRCA 2 gene mutation 
Were appropriate to receive treatment prior to surgery
Had breast cancer which had not spread to parts of the body that are f ar away 
from the breast
Had a measurable tumor and lymph nodes which were less than 2 inches in size
090177e1976a02d4\Approved\Approved On: 28-Jun-2021 02:29 (GMT)
Had not received other cancer treatment within the past 3 years (with the 
exception of treatments for breast cancer of the milk ducts only)
Had adequate ki dney, liver, and bone marrow function
A total of 61 women participated
No men participated  
All participants were between the ages of 26 and 75 years 
Participants received talazoparib treatment for 24 weeks.  Of the 61 participants who 
started the study , 45 participants (74%) completed talazoparib treatment.
A total of 16 participants (2 6%) stopped taking talazoparib early
by their choice, 
because their breast cancer was worsening,
because they had a medical problem, or
because a doctor decided it was best for them to stop talazoparib
How long did the study last?
The amount of time that each participant was in this study varied.  The entire study 
took about 2 years to complete.
After the last participant's surgical safety follow -up was completed, the st udy ended in 
September 2020, and the Sponsor began reviewing the information collected.  The 
Sponsor then created a report of the results.  This is a summary of that report.

What were the results of the study?
How many participants had a pathologic co mplete response 
(complete disappearance of cancer at surgery) after 24 weeks of 
treatment with talazoparib followed by surgery?
To answer this question, the researchers looked at the number of “evaluable 
participants” who had a complete disappearance of cancer at surgery.  Evaluable 
participants are participants thatthe researchers collected enough information from 
to get a good idea of how well the study treatments worked.  There were 48 evaluable 
participants in this study.
22 out of 48 evaluable participants (46%) had a pathologic complete response 
(complete disappearance of cancer at surgery) after 24 weeks of treatment with 
talazoparib followed by surgery.
The researchers also calculated the “confidence intervals”, which are used to show 
what the uncertainty is for a particular result.  The 95% and 80% confidence intervals 
showed:
a 95% confidence interval was between 32% and 61%
an 80% confidence interval was between 36% and 55%
This does not mean that everyone in this study had these results.  These are just some 
of the main findings of this study.  Other studies may have different results.

What medical problems did participants have during 
the study?
The researchers recorded any medical problems the participants had during the study.  
Participants could have had medical problems for reasons not related to the study (for 
example, caused by an unde rlying disease or by chance).  Or, medical problems could 
also have been caused by a study treatment or by another medicine the participant was 
taking.  Sometimes the cause of a medical problem is unknown.  By comparing 
medical problems across many treatme nt groups in many studies, doctors try to 
understand what effects a study medication might have on a participant.
60 out of 61 (98%) participants in this study had at least 1 medical problem.  A total 
of 3 out of 61 (5%) participants discontinued talazopar ib because of a medical 
problem. Medical problems were managed by holding talazoparib doses (33%), 
providing blood transfusions (33%), and reducing talazoparib doses (39%).
The most common medical problems –those reported by at least 10% of participants 
–are described below.

Did study participants have any serious medical 
problems?
A medical problem is considered “serious” when it is life-threatening, needs hospital 
care, or causes lasting problems.
11 out of 61 (18%) participants in this study had at least 1 serious medical problem.
No deaths occurred during the safety reporting period.  A total of 2 participants died 
during the long-term follow -up period due to progression of their breast cancer.  These 
deaths were not considered to be related to talazoparib.
The serious medical problems are described below.
