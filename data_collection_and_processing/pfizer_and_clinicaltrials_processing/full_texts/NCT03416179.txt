If you participated in this study, Pfizer, the Sponsor, would like to thank you for your 
participation. 
This summary will describe the study results. If you have any questions about the 
study or the results, please contact the doctor or staff at your study site.Why was this study done?
What is acute myeloid leukemia ?
Acute myeloid leukemia is also known as AML and isa common cancer of the blood.  
AML starts when myeloid cells in the bone marrow begin to grow out of control.  
The bone marrow is the soft inner part of certain bones, and it is where new blood 
cells are made.  The myeloid cells would normally develop into red blood cells, certain 
types of white blood cells, and platelets. Red blood cells are used to carry oxygen 
from the lungs around the body to where it is needed .  These red blood cells also take 
carbon d ioxide back to the lungs so it can be breathed out.  White blood cells are used 
to fight infections.  Platelets help to stop bleed ing when blood vessels are damaged.  
While AML starts in the bone marrow, it often spreads to other areas of the body.
What is glasdegib ?
This study investigated the use of g lasdegi b, which is new type of treatment known as 
a hedgehog or smoothened (SMO) inhibitors .  Glasdegib is designed to reduce or stop 
the growth of cancer cells. At the time this study began, g lasdegib was an 
investigational (or experimental) drug. An investigational drug is one that is not 
approved for sale in thecountry where it is being used . During this study, the US 
Food and Drug Administration (FDA) gave their approv al for glasdegib to be used 
with low dose cytarabine to treat newly diagnosed AML .  This was in November 
2018.  The European Medicines Agency (EMA) gave their approval in June 202 0. 
Glasdegib is sold in these countries as DAURISMO®.
The other treatments used in this study are cytarabine, daunorubicin, and azac itidine.  
These are alllicensed cancer treatments for AML and are often described as 
chemotherapy.  
What was the purpose of this study?
The purpose of this research study is to compare the effects of the study drug, 
glasdegib, with a placebo, to find out how well glasdegib worked in combination with 
chemotherap yto help participants live longer .  Two different types of chemotherapy 
were tested in this study:Intensive chemotherapy with cytarabine and daunorubicin.  These treatments are 
often used to treat patients with AML in the US and Europe, but this type of 
chemotherapy is quite aggressive.  This means the medicines are strong and quite
toxic and not all patients with AML are suitable for this intensive chemotherapy .
Standard c hemotherapy with azacitidine .  This is one of the medicines used to 
treating patients with AML in the US and Europe if the patient is not suitable for 
intensive chemotherapy.
Researchers wanted to know:
Did the participants taking glasdegib with chemotherapy live 
longer compared to participants not taking glasdegib ?
What happened during the study?
How was the study done?
This study included participants with AML who had not previously been treated for 
their cancer .  The participants were split into 2 groups:
An Intensive Treatment G roup –this included participants who were suitable 
for intensive chemotherapy with cytarabine and daunorubicin
ANon-Intensive Treatment G roup –this included participants who were not 
suitable for intensive chemotherapy and who were given standard 
chemotherapy with azacitidine.   
The r esearchers then tested glasdegib on each group of study participants to find out 
if study participants taking glasdegib plus chem otherapy lived longer compared to 
study participants given placebo plus chemotherapy .A placebo does not have any 
medicine in it, but it looks just like the study medication. Participants took g lasdegib 
or placebo tablet sonce a day and this treatment could be continued for up to 2 years.   
Participants received intensive or non-intensive chemotherapy ,and this was given according to the manufacturer’s recommendations.   Participants who stopped 
treatment in this study were followed to check on their health .
Researchers compared the results of study participants taking glasdegib plus 
chemotherapy to the results of study participants taking placebo plus chemotherapy .  
The study participants and researchers did not know who took glasdegib and who 
took the placebo.   This is known as a “blinded” study.  This study was double -
blinded, which means nobody knew who was taking what treatment during t he study.  
Study p articipants were assigned to each group by chance alone.
The study plan is shown in Figure 1. 
Figure 1: Study Plan
Where did this study take place?
For the Intensive Treatment G roup, t he Sponsor ran this study at 94locations in
20countries in North America, Central America, Europe, Asia, and Australia .For the 
Non-Intensive Treatment G roup, the Sponsor ran this study at 83 locations in 
21countries in North America, Central America, Europe, Asia, and Australia.
When did this study take place?
For the Intensive Treatment G roup, the study began 20April 2018 and ended 
01February 2021, with data collected up to 11 November 202 1. For the 
Non-Intensive Treatment Group, the study began 18 June 2018 and ended 
05June 2020, with data collected up to 17 January 2022 . 
Who participated in this study?
The study included participants who had AML but who had not previously been 
treated for their cancer. 
In the Intensive Treatment Group, 
A total of 236men participated
A total of 168women participated
All participants were between the ages of 19and 86 years
In the Non-Intensive Treatment Group, 
A total of 186men participated
A total of 139women participated
All participants were between the ages of 47and94 years
Participants were to be treated until their cancer got worse, they experienced 
unacceptable toxicity, they left the study, or the participant died . 
In the Intensive Treatment Group , of the 399participants who started the study and 
received treatment , 390participants stopped taking the study treatment.  All 
399participants left before the study was over by their choice or a doctor decided it 
was best for a participant to stop being in the study , or because they passed away ,or 
the Sponsor closed the st udy.  Most participants left the study because they died.
In the Non-Intensive Treatment Group, of the 3 22participants who started the study 
and received treatment, 3 06participants stopped taking the study treatment.  There were 3 05participants who left before the study was over by their choice or a doctor 
decided it was best for a participant to stop being in the study ,or because they passed 
away , orthe Sponsor closed the study.  Most participants left the study because they 
died or because the Sponso r closed the study.   There are 7 participants who are 
continuing in this st udy from the Non -Intensive Treatment Group.
How long did the study last?
In the Intensive Treatment Group, s tudy participants were in the study for up to 
2years and 9 months , with data collected for around 3 years and 7 months .  In the 
Non-Intensive Treatment Group, study participants were in the study for up to 1 year 
and 11 months, with data collected for around 3 years and 7 months .  
The researchers stopped participants in theIntensive Treatment Group from 
continuing in the study after an early analysis of the data in 2020 .  They did this 
because they found there was no difference between the participants who were treated 
with glasdegib plus intensive chemot herapy and participants who were treated with 
placebo plus intensive chemotherapy .
For the Intensive Treatment Group, the Sponsor began reviewing the information 
collected up to November 2021 and closed this part of the study early .  The Sponsor 
then creat ed a report of the results.  For the Non -Intensive Treatment Group, the 
Sponsor began reviewing the information collected up to January 2022 .  The Sponsor 
then created a report of the results. This is a summary of th e report s for the Intensive 
Treatment G roup and the Non-Intensive Treatment Group.   At the time of writing, 
there are 7 participants from the Non -Intensive Treatment Group who are continuing 
in this study.
What were the results of the study?
Did the participants taking glasdegib with chemotherapy live longer 
compared to participants not taking glasdegib?
To answer this question, researchers looked at the overall survival of participants in 
the study .  Overall survival is the number of participants in a treatment group who are alive at the end of astudy.  Researchers calculated this by compar ingthe number of 
participants who were alive in the glasdegib plus chemotherapy group with the 
number of participants who were alive in the placebo plus chemotherapy . 
What was the overall survival of participants taking glasdegib 
compared to participants taking placebo in the Intensive 
Treatment Group ?
At the end of the study, 9 2out of the 201 (4 6%)participants who were originally 
allocated treatment with glasdegib plusintensive chemothe rapy were known to be 
alive.  There were 95out of the 203 ( 47%) participants who were originally 
allocated treatment with placebo plusintensive chemotherapy known to be alive.  
The researchers concluded that the results were similar between the glasdegib and 
placebo groups as shown in Figure 2.
Figure 2. Intensive Treatment Group: 
Participants Who Were Alive at the End of the Study
What was the overall survival of participants taking glasdegib 
compared to participants taking placebo in the Non -Intensive
Treatment Group?
At the end of the study, 39out of the 163 ( 24%) participants who were originally 
allocated t reatment with glasdegib plus standard chemotherapy were known to be 
alive.  There were 37 out of the 162 ( 23%) participants who were originally 
allocated treatment with p lacebo plus standard chemotherapy known to be alive .  
The researchers concluded that the results were similar between the glasdegib and 
placebo groups as shown in Figure 3.
Figure 3. Non -Intensive Treatment Group: 
Participants Who Were Alive at the End of the Study
Based on these results, the researchers have decided that the study results are likely 
the result of chance.  This means the study did not show that one treatment was 
better than another at helping participants with untreated AML live longer .  
Participants in b oth the glasdegib and placebo groups had a similar amount of 
survival .
This does not mean that everyone in this study had these results.  This is a summary 
of just some of the main results of this study.  Other studies with glasdegib may 
have different results.
What medical problems did participants have during 
the study?
The researchers recorded any medical problems the participants had during the study.  
Participants could have had medical problems for reasons not related to the study (for 
example, caused by an underlying disease or by chance). Or, medical problems could 
also have been caused by a study treatment or by another medicine the participant was 
taking. Sometimes the cause of a medical problem is unknown. By comparing 
medical problems across many treatment groups in many studies, doctors try to 
understand what e ffects a study medication might have on a participant.
In the Intensive Treatment Group, 394out of 399 ( 99%) participants in this study had 
at least 1 medical problem.   A total of 41(10%) participants left the study because of 
medical problems.  In the Non-Intensive Treatment Group, 319out of 322(99%) 
participants in this study had at least 1 medical problem.  A total of 108(34%) 
participants left the study because of medical problems.  
The most common medical problems –those reported by at least 30% of participants
–are described below.
Below are instructions on how to read Table 1 and 2 .  These instructions can also 
be used for Table 3 and 4, which list sserious medical problem s.
Instructions for Understanding Table 1 and 2 . 
The 1stcolumn of Table 1 and 2 lists medical problems that were 
commonly reported during the study.  All medical problems reported 
by at least 30% of participants are listed.
The 2ndcolumn tells how many of the participants taking the
glasdegib plus intensive or standard chemotherapy reported each 
medical problem.  Next to this number is the percentage of the 
participants taking glasdegib plus intensive or standard chemotherapy 
who reported the medical problem. The 3rdcolumn tells how many of the participants taking placebo plus 
intensive or standard chemotherapy reported each medical problem.  
Next to this number is the percentage of the participants taking 
placebo plus intensive or standard chemotherapy who reported the 
medical problem.
Using these instructions , you can see that:
oIn the Intensive Treatment Group , 110out of the 198(56%) 
participants taking glasdegib plus intensive chemotherapy 
reported nausea .  A total of 108out of the 201 (54%) 
participants taking a placebo plus intensive chemotherapy
