2WHY WAS THIS STUDY DONE?
Cancer, in general, is one of the common causes of death for both men and women .   
Drug PF -05212384 (gedatolisib ) was the investigational drug in this study.  An 
investigational drug is one that is not approved for sale in this country at the time of 
the study.  Gedatolisib is still under development to control the growth of cancer 
cells.  Researchers think that ged atolisib might help to stop or slow down certain types 
of proteins which cause cancer cells to grow. Gedatolisib stops cancer growth 
pathways .
This study was divided into 2 parts, or phases.  The main purpose of this trial was to 
learn about the effects o f gedatolisib and to find a correct dose for when it is given in 
combination with other drugs in adult patients with different types of advanced 
cancer.  All the patients in this study received gedatolisib in addition to one other 
drug.  There were 3 treatment combinations or groups called “arms” in this study:
(Arm A) -Docetaxel kills fast dividing cells like cancer cells .
(Arm B) -Cisplatin stops cancer cells from growing.
(Arm C) -Dacomitinib inhibits cancer growth pathways.
Both docetaxel and cisp latin are regarded as standard treatment for these types of 
cancer.
In the first part of the study, several patients left the study early on due to their cancer 
getting worse or due to other medical problems.  As a result, Arms A and C had to 
finish early .  This means that only Arm B (gedatolisib in combination with cisplatin) 
was used to estimate the correct dose of gedatolisib for that combination.
In the second part of the study, researchers wanted to assess the effect of gedatolisib 
when taken in comb ination with cisplatin in patients with a certain type of breast 
cancer called Triple Negative Breast Cancer (TNBC).

3WHAT HAPPENED DURING THIS STUDY?
The first part of this study was set up to determine the best dose of gedatolisib (the 
test medicine) when taken in combination with another drug.   The first part of this
study compared 3 groups of patients that were given gedatolisib at different doses in
combination with 1 of 3 other treatments.  Both the patients and researchers kne w 
who took which medicine.  The figure below shows the 3 groups in the study .

4The first part of the study included patients who were: 
Aged 18 years or over
Had a diagnosis of specific types of advanced cancer as described in the table 
above.
Patients were unable to take part in the first part of the study if they had active brain 
cancer, sever e heart disease, or had experienced a heart attack in the previous 
12months.
The time that patients spent in the overall study varied depending on the individual. 
There was no maximum to the number of cycles of treatment that a patient could 
undergo.   The entire study took over 6 years to complete.

5Patients were to be treated until their cancer got worse, until they had unacceptable 
medical problems or until they chose to stop.  Of the 85 patients who were treated 
and who star ted the first part of the study to find the best dose, 45 finished the study.  
Forty (40) patients did not finish the first part of the study because they left before the 
study was over by their choice or a doctor decided it was best for a patient to stop 
being in the study.   
The second part of the study was an extension of Arm B and was made up of patients 
with Triple Negative Breast Cancer taking gedatolisib plus cisplatin.  All the patients 
in this second part of the study were aged 18 years or over and were selected because 
their cancer had spread.   
This group was spilt into 2further groups as shown in the table below:
-Arm 1 –Patients who had not received chemotherapy to try to kill their cancer 
cells after the cancer had spread.
-Arm 2 –Patients wh o had received 1 or 2 rounds of chemotherapy to try and 
kill their cancer cells after their cancer had spread.
Patients were unable to take part in the second part of the study if they had active 
brain cancer or if they had received 3 or more rounds of che motherapy to try to kill 
their cancer cells after it had spread. 
This part of the study only included people with Triple Negative Breast Cancer, 
22patients started the study and 12 patients finished the study.  Ten (10) patients left 
this part of the study before the end.

6The Sponsor ran this whole study at 16 locations in 5 countries including the United 
States (US), Canada, United Kingdom (UK), Italy and Spain.  It began 10 
September 2013 and ended 8 January 2020.  In total 34 men and 73 women took part 
inthe overall study including both part 1 and 2 of the study.  All patients were 
between the ages of 22 and 74.
When the overall study ended in January 2020, the Sponsor began reviewing the 
information collected.  The Sponso r then created a report of the results.  This is a 
summary of that report.

7WHAT WERE THE RESULTS OF THIS STUDY?
During the first part of the study, what dose -limiting 
toxicities (DLT) were reported?
In the first part of the study, researchers wanted to find out what was the correct dose 
of gedatolisib for treating patients with cancer. 
To find the correct maximum dose that patients can take without causing unwanted 
medical problems, the researchers n eeded to know how many patients in each group 
had a dose -limiting toxicity (DLT) during their treatment.
Arm A ( gedatolisib together with docetaxel) and Arm C ( gedatolisib together with 
dacomitinib) were both closed early so it was not possible to calculat e the correct dose 
in these two groups.
Out of the 33 patients that started Arm B (gedatolisib together with cisplatin), 2 8
stayed in the study long enough to measure whether a dose -limiting toxicity had taken 
place during their treatment .  Patients in this part of the trial were given different 
doses of gedatolisib together with 75 mg /m2of cisplatin.  Two (2)people out of the 
28 experienced a dose -limiting toxicity.  Using this information, the researchers 
decided that 180 mg weekly was th e correct maximum dose of gedatolisib to be used 
in combination with cisplatin 75 mg /m2every 3 weeks in the second part of the study.
During the second part of the study, did taking gedatolisib 
together with cisplatin help tumors disappear or shrink in 
patients with Triple Negative Breast Cancer ?
Researchers looked at the “overall response rate”, which is whether tumors 
completely disappeared (known as a “complete response”) or shrunk (known as a 
“partial response”) after taking gedatolisib together with cisplatin.  In Arm 1 (those 
patients who had not previously had chemotherapy to kill their cancer cells after their 
cancer had spread) the overall response rate was 40%.  This means that 4 out of the 
10 treated people had either a complete o r partial response to the study drug.

8In Arm 2 (those patients who had been given chemotherapy to kill their cancer cells 
after their cancer had spread) the overall response rate was 33%.  This means that 
4out of the 12 treated people had a complete or partial response to the study drug.
Overall, 36% of patients (8 out of 22 treated patients) in this study who took the test 
medicine saw their condition improve.  
Did taking gedatolisib in combination with cisplatin help 
tumors disappear, shrink or sta y the same for 24 weeks ?
Researchers looked at whether tumors disappeared, shrunk or stayed the same (e.g. 
“stable disease”) for 24 weeks, as this gives researchers an idea of the clinical benefit 
of gedatolisib when used in combination with cisplatin.   Overall, 12 patients had 
clinical benefit from treatment at 24 weeks (55%, or 12 out of the 22 treated patients).   
This included patients from Arm 1 (60%, or 6 out of the 10 treated patients) and 
patients from Arm 2 (50%, or 6 out of the 12 treated patients) .

9Based on these results, the researchers have decided gedatolisib in combination with 
cisplatin was generally tolerated by patients in the study.        
This does not mean that everyone in this study had these results.  Other studies may 
produce different results, as well.  These are just some of the main findings of the 
study, and more information may be available at the websites listed at the end of this 
summary.   
WHAT MEDICAL PROBLEMS DID PATIENTS 
HAVE DURING THE STUDY?
The researchers recorded any medical problems the patients had during the study.  
Patients could have had medical problems for reasons not related to the study (for 
example, caused by an underlying disease or by chance).  Or, medical problems could 
also have been caused b y a study treatment or by another medicine the patient was 
taking.  Sometimes the cause of a medical problem is unknown.  By comparing 
medical problems across many treatment groups in many studies, doctors try to 
understand what the side effects of an expe rimental drug might be.
During the first part of this study, all the patients had at least 1 medical problem.  A 
total of 18 out of 85patients left this part of the study because of medical problems.

12WERE THERE ANY SERIOUS MEDICAL 
PROBLEMS?
A medical problem is considered “serious” when it is life -threatening, needs hospital 
care, or causes lasting problems.   
Of the 107 patients who received treatment in this study, 37 (35%) had a serious 
medical problem including 11 patients who died.
In the first part of this study to find the correct dose, 31 patients out of the 85 treated 
patients had serious medical problems.  These included the cancer coming back or 
getting worse, irritation of the moist linings of the mouth, throat and airways, an d low 
white blood cell count with a fever , shortness of breath and dehydration .
In addition, a total of 11 patients passed away during Part A of this study (4 in Arm A, 
4 in Arm B, and 3 in Arm C) and the main cause of deaths was cancer.  None of the 
death s were related to the study drug.
In the second part of the study, 6 patients out of 22 had serious medical problems .  
This included irritation of the moist linings of the mouth, throat and airways .Four 
(4) patients died during Part B of the study and the main cause of deaths was cancer.  
None of the deaths were related to the study drug.
