2WHY WAS THIS STUDY DONE?
The 13 -valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine ( 13vPnC )may help prevent 
pneumococcal disease cause dby the “bacteria ”,or germ ,Streptococcus pneumonia e. This
germ is also known as S.pneumonia e, pneumococcus ,or pneumococci .  S. pneumonia e
can spread from person to person through coughing and sneezing .  Sometimes the 
S.pneumonia ecan cause p neumococcal disease .  This can include infections in the ear 
and/orinthe “sinuses”, which arethe space sin the bones behind the nose as well as 
more serious conditions such as “meningitis ” or “pneumonia ”.  Meningitis happens
when S.pneumoniae infect the covering saround the brain and spinal cord ,and 
pneumonia happens wh en the pneumococcal infection is in the lungs.
When given the 13vPnC vaccine , a person’s “immune system ”make s“antibodies” 
against 13 different sugars in the vaccine.  These sugars are like the ones found on the 
surface of S. pneumoniae , with a different sugar on the surface of each “strain” or type 
of S.pneumoniae. The immune system is what defends the body from germs like 
S.pneumoniae .  Antibodies are germ -fighting proteins that can recognize 13 common 
strains of S. pneumoniae that cause people to become sick.  Once the immune system 
recognize s the pneumococci , the immune system can then kill the pneumococci and 
stop an infection from developing in someone who has been vaccinated .  This will 
only happen if the infection is caused by 1 of the 13 most common types of 
S.pneumoniae that the vaccine protects against.
13vPnC is a vaccine that has been approved for sale in many countries ,including 
Europe and Japan where it is sold as Prevenar 13®and the United States wh ere it is 
known as Prevnar 13®.  In Japan, the 13vPnC vaccine can be given to infants and 
children under 6 years and to people who are aged 65 years and older. This vaccine is 
not currently licensed for use in people aged 6 to 64 years in Japan .  The researchers 
did this st udy to learn more about how this vaccine works in Japanese people aged 
6to 64 years.
WHAT HAPPENED DURING THE STUDY?
This study compared 2groups of participant s, children and adolescents aged 6 to 
under 18 years and adults aged 18 to under 65 years, to find out if participant s given 
13vPnC were able to make antibodies that recognize 13 common types of 
S.pneumoniae. The researchers also wanted to see if the participants had any safety
issues in the month after having the 13vPn Cvaccine.  The study participants were all 3Japanese people with illnesses that mean they are more likely to get pneumococcal 
disease.
All participants in this study received a single dose of 13vPnC on Day 1 at the start of 
the study .
4While participant swere only in the study for approximately 1month, the entire study 
took approximately 4months to complete.  The sponsor ran this study at 8locations 
across Japan.   It began 12July2018 and ended 16November 2018 .  31boys and 
22girls aged 7 to 17 year s as well as 76 men and 77women aged 18 to 64years 
participated.  All of the 206 participant s were between the ages of 7and 64 years .
Participant s were given a single dose of the 13vPnC vaccine .  Of the 206participant s 
who started the study, all 206 finished the study and all were asked to write down if 
they had experienced anyreaction sto the 13vPnC vaccine .
When the study ended in November 2018 , the Sponsor began reviewing the 
infor mation collected.  The Sponsor then cr eated a report of the result s. This is a 
summary of that report.
WHAT WERE THE RESULTS OF THE STUDY?
Did the 13vPnC vaccine make antibodies that recognize d
S.pneumoniae ?
When blood samples taken 1 month after being given the 13vPnC vaccine were 
tested , antibodies were seen against the 13 common types of S. pneumoniae. There 
were different average amounts of antibody produced foreach of the 13 common 
typesof S.pneumoniae .  All of t hese a ntibody levels were high enough to show that 
13vPnC produc ed an “immune response” tothe vaccine.  Animmune response 
means a person’s immune system is able to recognize and produce antibody against a
vaccine .  The antibody responses were higher in the group aged 6 tounder 18 years 
compared with the group aged 18 to under 65 years old.
Did participants who were given the 13vPnC vaccine have 
any reactions to the vaccine ?
The researchers looked at whether there were any “local” reactions to the vaccine.  A 
local reaction is something that is seen at the site where the injection of vaccine was 
given and can include pain at the vaccination site, redness, and/or swelling.  These 
local vaccination site reactions were reported by the study participants on Day 1 
through Day 7 for participants aged 6 to under 18 years and on Day 1 through Day 14 
for participants aged 18 to under 65 years.  Local vaccination site reactions reported 
by participants may not have been reported by the study doctors as medical problems.  5Local vaccination site reactions were reported in 43 out of 52 participants (83%) aged 
6 to under 18 years and in 98 out of 146 participants (67%) aged 18 to under 65 years.  
Pain at the vaccination site was the most common local reaction in both age groups.  
Most vaccination site reactions were mild or moderate in severity.  Severe rea ctions to 
13vPnC were reported in 3 out of the 198 participants who had any local reaction 
after receiving 13vPnC.  Severe local reactions were reported by 1 participant who was 
aged 6 to under 18 years who had severe swelling and 2 participants who were a ged 
18to under 65 years who both had severe pain at the vaccination site.

The researchers also looked at whether there were any “systemic events” or reactions 
to the vaccine.  Systemic means something that affects the whole body or specific 
parts of it, like the muscles or joints.  The systemic events were reactions that 
partici pants might have after they had been given the vaccine, like feeling tired, 
muscle pain, headache, loose stools, high temperature, and/or being sick.  Systemic 
events were reported by the study participants on Day 1 through Day 7 for 
participants aged 6 to under 18 years and on Day 1 through Day 14 for participants 
aged 18 to under 65 years.  The systemic events reported by participants may not have 
been reported by the doctors as medical problems.  Systemic events reported in 
participants given the 13vPnC vaccine are listed in the following table.  Systemic 
events were reported by 31 out of 51 participants (61%) aged 6 to under 18 years and 
85 out of 145 participants (59%) aged 18 to under 65 years.  
The most common systemic events were feeling tired, musc le pain, and headache.  
Most systemic events were mild or moderate in severity.  There were 2 severe 6systemic events in participants aged 6 to under 18 years (1 case of severe tiredness and 
1 case of severe headache) and 3 severe systemic events in partici pants aged 18 to 
64years (1 case of severe diarrhea or loose stools, 1 case of severe muscle pain, and 
1case of severe joint pain).  Overall, 3 out of 47 (6%) participants aged 6 to under 
18years and 11 out of 134 (8%) participants aged 18 to under 65 years took medicine 
after having been given the 13vPnC vaccine, to either help lower their body 
temperature (eg, because of fever) or for pain relief.

WHAT MEDICAL PROBLEMS DID 
PARTICIPANTS HAVE DURING THE STUDY? 
The researchers recorded any medical problems the participant shad during the study. 
Participant s could have had medical problems for reasons not related to the study (for 
example, caused by an underlying disease or by chance). Or, medical problems could 
also have been caused by the study vaccine , or by another medicine the participan t
was taking. Sometimes the cause of a medical problem is unknown. By comparing 7medical problems across many vaccine groups in many studies, doctors try to 
understand what the side effects of an experimental drug or vaccine might be.
33 out of 206 participants (16%) in this study had at least 1 medical problem within 
1month of being given the 13vPnC vaccine.  This included 6participants who had a 
medical problem that the doctor thought was related to the 13vPnC vaccine (3%, or 
6out of 206 participants, with 3 participants in each age group) .  In the group of 
participants aged 6 to under 18 years, t hese related medical problems were 1 report 
each of vaccination site pain, vaccination site swelling, and reduced appetite. In the 
group of participants aged 18 to under 65 years, these related medical problems were 
2reports of vaccination site pain and 1 report of waking from sleep during the middle 
of the night .  
Most of the medical problems were mild or moderate in severity.  There wer e 2severe 
medical problems (1 case of severe asthma in a participant aged 6 to under 18 years 
and 1 case of severe back pain in a participant aged 18 to under 65 years).  The study 
doctor sdid not think these severe medical problems were related to the 13 vPnC 
vaccine.  None of the participants left the study because of medical problems .
The most common medical problems reported by 2 or more participants are listed 
below.

This does not mean that everyone in this study had these results.  Other studies may 
produce different results, as well.  These are just some of the main findings of the 
study, and more information may be available at the websites listed at the end of this 
summary.   8WERE THERE ANY SERIOUS MEDICAL 
PROBLEMS?
A medical problem is considered “serious” when it is life -threatening, needs hospital 
care, or causes lasting problems .
None of the 206 participant s had serious medical problems .  Noparticipant s died 
during the study.
