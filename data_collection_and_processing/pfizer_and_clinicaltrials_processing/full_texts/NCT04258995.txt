Clinical Study Results
This summary reports the results of only one study.  Researchers must look at the 
results of many types of studies to understand if a study vaccine works, how it works, 
and if it is safe to prescribe to study participants.  The results of this study might be 
different than the results of other studies that the researchers review.

Why was this study done?
What is Group B Streptococcus?
Group B Streptococcus (GBS) is a germ (bacteria) that may cause serious disease, 
including sepsis (a systemic inflammatory reaction that may affect several organs in 
the body), meningitis (infections of the lining covering the brain and spinal cord), and 
pneumonia (lung infection).
What is GBS6?
Group B streptococcus 6 -valent polysaccharide conjugate vaccine (GBS6) is a vaccine 
under development to prevent disease caused by 6 different ty pes of GBS infection.  
Vaccines help a person’s body with the ability to prevent infection from GBS using 
the body’s disease -fighting system (immune response).  GBS6 is made from a 
weakened part of the germ (sugar coat of bacteria) added to a separate stro nger carrier 
protein which helps increase the body’s immune response after vaccination. 
What was the purpose of this study?
This study is a follow -up to a previous study where participants received 1 of 6 
dose/formulations of GBS6 or a placebo, approxima tely 2 years before this study.  
The purpose of the study was to evaluate the safety and tolerability of a booster dose 
of GBS6, an investigational vaccine, in healthy adults.  Investigational means that a 
vaccine is not approved for usein this country.  Safety means that any reactions or 
medical problems that happened in the study were studied.  Tolerability refers to 
whether reactions to the vaccine interfered with a participant's usual activities.

What happened during the study?
Researchers tested 2 forms of GBS6 in 2 groups of study participants to find out if 
GBS6 was safe and well -tolerated.  The 2 forms of vaccine were GBS6 with 
aluminium phosphate (AlPO 4) and GBS6 without AlPO 4.  
The study was an open -label study which mean that participants and
researchers knew which vaccine they were receiving. Participants received the 
same form of vaccine (GBS6 with AlPO 4or GBS6 without AlPO 4) as they 
received in the previous study.  The dose of vaccine given in this study is 
considered to be a booster dose .
Participants received a shot of their assigned vaccine in their upper arm on 
Day 1 of the study. 
Participants recorded any reactions or other medical problems in an electronic 
diary for 14 days following study vaccination. 
1 month after receiving the v accine, participants had a clinic visit to have their 
blood drawn, see how they were doing, and report any medical problems.
6 months after receiving the vaccine, participants received a phone call to see 
how they were doing and to report any medical probl ems.

Where did this study take place? 
The Sponsor ran this study at 4 locations in the United States.
When did this study take place?
It began February 2020 and ended September 2020. 
Who participated in this study?
The study included participants who were healthy adults and received GBS6 in the 
previous study.  Participants who received placebo in the previous study were not 
included in this study.  Pregnant women did not participate in this study.  
152participants were randomized in the study.  One participant did not receive 
vaccine ,therefore a total of 151 participants received GBS6 in this study. 
This study, an extension to a completed study, evaluated the safety and tolerability 
from a booster vaccine dose of GBS6.  This study vaccine was given approximately 
2years after a primary GBS6 dose to healthy adult males and non -pregnant women.

A total of 37 (25%) men participated
A total of 114 (76%) women participated
Participants were between the ages of 20 years and 52 years
Of the 151 participants who started the study, 149 (99%) finished the study.
2 participants did not finish the study because they were lost to follow -up.  Lost to 
follow -up means that the participant did not return for clinic visits and did not 
respond to phone calls from the study site staff.
Noparticipants withdrew from the study or were asked to withdraw by the study staff 
or the Sponsor.
How long did the study last?
Study participants were in the study for 6 months .  The entire study took about 
7month s to complete.
The trial began in February 2020 and was completed in September 2020, which 
included the period when the COVID -19 pandemic was occurring globally.  The study 
was completed despite the impact of the pandemic and the study objectives were 
achieved.  A decision was made to stop enrollment of participants for 3 weeks between 
March 2020 and April 2020.  It was then decided by the study team that enough 
participants were randomized and that no more participants would be added.  Further 
study visits were performed with minimal impact to the study. 
When the study ended in September 2020, the Sponsor began reviewing the 
information collected.  The Sponsor then created a report of the results.  This is a 
summary of that report.
What medical problems did participants have during 
the study?
The researchers recorded any medical problems the participants had during the study.  
Participants could have had medical problems for reasons not related to the study (for 
090177e1989a9cbe\Approved\Approved On: 16-Nov-2021 02:15 (GMT)
example, caused by an underlying disease or by chance).  Medical problems could also 
have been caused by the study vaccine or by another medicine the participant was 
taking.  Sometimes the cause of a medical problem is unknown.  By comparing 
medical proble msacross many groups in many studies, doctors try to understand 
what effects a study vaccine might have on a participant.
113 out of 151 (75%) participants in this study had at least 1 non-serious medical 
problem within 1 month after vaccination .  Of the 76 participants who received GBS6 
with AlPO 4, 59 participants (78%) reported a non-serious medical problem.  Of the 
75participants who received GBS6 without AlPO 4, 54participants (72%) reported a 
non-serious medical problem.  No participants left the stu dy because of medical 
problems.  The most common non-serious medical problems –those reported by 
more than 10% of participants –are described below.

Below are instructions on how to read Table 1. 
Instructions for Understanding Table 1. 
The 1stcolumn of Table 1 lists non-serious medical problems that 
were commonly reported during the study.  All non-serious medical 
problems reported by more than 10% of participants are listed.
The 2ndcolumn tells how many of the 76 participants taking GBS6 
with AlPO 4reported each medical problem .  Next to this number is 
the percentage of the 76 participants taking GBS6 with AlPO 4 who 
reported the medical problem . 
The 3rdcolumn tells how many of the 75 participants taking GBS6 
without AlPO 4reported each medical problem .  Next to this number is 
the percentage of the 75 participants taking GBS6 without AlPO 4who 
reported the medical problem .
Using these instructions, you can see that 52 out of the 76 participants 
(68%) taking the GBS6 with AlPO 4reported pain where vaccine was 
injected.  A total of 32 out of the 75 (43%) participants taking GBS6 
without AlPO 4reported pain where vaccine was injected.

Did study participants have any serious medical 
problems?
A medical problem is considered “serious” when it is life-threatening, needs hospital 
care, or causes lasting problems.
1 participant (1%, or 1 out of 151 participants) had a serious medical problem during 
the study .  
1 participant in the GBS6 with AlPO 4group had a serious medical problem 
(thermal burn) during the study . 
No participant sin the GBS6 without AlPO 4had a serious medical problem
during the study .

Researchers do not believe the serious medical problem reported by the participant 
was relat ed to study vaccine .  No participants passed away during the study.
