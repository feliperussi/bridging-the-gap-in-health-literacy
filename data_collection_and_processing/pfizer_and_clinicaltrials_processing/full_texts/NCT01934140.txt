2WHY WAS THIS STUDY DONE?
Invasive m eningococcal disease is an illness which maycause a serious infection inthe 
blood, as well as swelling around the brain and spinal cord.  People who get this 
illness are at risk for disabilities such as hearing loss and loss of limbs, and even death .  
However, invasive meningococcal disease may be prevented with a vaccine.  A 
vaccine is a type of medic inethat helps people fight off germs.
Meningococcal disease is cau sed by the meningococcus germ.  There are different 
types of this germ.  For example, meningococcal type Adisease is caused by the 
meningococcus Agerm.  MenACWY -TT(Nimenrix) is a vaccine approved in Europe 
for the prevention of meningococcal disease .This vaccine targets 4 common types of 
meningoc occus germ: types A, C, Y, and W -135.  It is given by injection into the 
muscle .  
The main purpose of this stud y was to learn more about the long -term effects of 
Nimenrix in healthy participants , compared to another vaccine against meningococcal 
disease, called Mencevax® ACWY. Mencevax is also aimed at preventing 
meningococcal diseases caused by the meni ngococcus A, C, Y, and W -135 germs.  
Researchers wanted to know:
Would participants who received Nimenrix still have antibodies against 
meningococcus germ sat 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10years after vaccination, 
compared to participants who received Mencevax?
To answer thisquestion, researchers collected blood samples from the participants .  
The researchers looked for antibodies in the blood against the 4 different types of 
meningococcus germ.  Antibodies are special proteins that can recognize and help kill 
germs.  These antibodies can protect people from getting sick if they ever do come 
into contact with meningococcus germs.

3WHAT HAPPENED DURING THE STUDY?
This study compared 2groups of participants to learn more abou t the long -term 
effects of MenACWY -TT. 
The sponsor asked participants who participated in aprevious stud yon Nimenrix to 
join this study .All the participants were healthy and had received vaccination with 
Nimenrix or Mencevax during the previous stud y.
The participants were placed in 2groups (the same groups as the previous study):
Group 1: Participants who received N imenrix in the previous study (235 
participants )
Group 2: Participants who received Men cevax in the previous study (76 
participants )
The participants were asked to come to up to 5 visits, each a year apart, at the study 
center.  This was known as the “persistence phase” of the study.  During these visits, 
the researchers collected blood samples from the participants .  The researchers looked 
for antibodies in the blood against the 4 different types of meningococcus germ.   
164 p articipants from the Nimenrix group and 56 participants from the Mencevax 
group received a booster dose of Nimenrix at study visit 5. This was known as the 
“booster phase” of the study.
This was an “open label” study, which means that the participants and th e researchers 
knew which vaccine the participants received.
The figure on the following page shows what happened during this study.

4Participants were in this study for up to 4 years, andthe entire study took a little more 
than 4 years to complete.  Participants joined the study at 1 of 2locations in the 
Philippines .The first participant joined the study on 29 April 2014 and the last 
participant finished the study on 10August 2018.  A total of 163 men (52%) and 148 
women (48%) joined the study .  All participants were between 18 and 60 years old.
Participants were supposed to come to up to 5 visits, each a year apart ,at the study 
center. Of the 311 participants who started the study, 2 03(65%) completed all visits .  
A total of 80 participants did not finish the study by their choice or because a doctor 
decided it was best for a participant to stop the study .
When the study ended in August 2018, the Sponsor began reviewing the information 
collected.  The Sponsor then created a report of the re sults. This is a summary of that 
report.

5WHAT WERE THE RESULTS OF THE STUDY? 
Did participants who received Nimenrix still have antibodies 
against meningococcus germ sat 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10years after 
vaccination, compared to participants who received
Mencevax ?
In general, participants from the Nimenrix and Mencevax group sstill had antibodies 
against meningococc usgerm sat each of the study visits .  The amount of antibodies in 
the blood was similar at each study visit.   
The charts below show the percentage of participants in each group who still had a 
certain level of antibodies against meningococcus germs at 7, 8,9, and 10 years after 
vaccination.   The year 6 visit was not completed in this study.  Therefore, there is no
data for this visit.

Year 9 83% 90% 56% 90%

This does not mean that everyone in this study had these results.  Other studies may 
produce different results, as well.  These are just some of the main findings of the 
study, and more information may be available at the websites listed at the end of this 
summary .  
WHAT MEDICAL PROBLEMS D ID 
PARTICIPANTS HAVE DURING THE STUDY?
The researchers recorded medical problems the participants had during the study.
Participants could have had medical problems for reasons not related to the study (for 
example, caused by an underlying disease or by c hance).  Or, medical problems could 
also have been caused by a study vaccine , or by another medicine the participant was 
taking.  Sometimes the cause of a medical problem is unknown.  By comparing 
medical problems across many treatment groups in many studi es, doctors try to 
understand what the side effects of an experimental drug might be.
During the booster phase, the researchers recorded medical problems that occurred 
within 31 days of receiving the booster vaccine. Out of 164participants in the 
Nimenrix group, 15 participants (9%) had a medical problem during this time.  Out of 
56participants in the Mencevax group, 2 participants (4%) had a medical problem 
during this time .  
Themedical problems during the booster phase are listed on the following page.

8WERE THERE ANY SERIOUS MEDICAL 
PROBLEMS?
A medical problem is considered “serious” when it is life -threatening, needs hospital 
care, or causes lasting problems .  
No participants in this study had a serious medical problem. No participants died 
during this study.
