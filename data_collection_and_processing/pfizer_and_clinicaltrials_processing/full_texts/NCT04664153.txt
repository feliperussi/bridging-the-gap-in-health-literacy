If you participated in this study, Pfizer, the Sponsor, would like to thank you for your 
participation. 
This summary will describe the study results. If you have any questions about the study 
or the results, please contact the doctor or staff at your study site.Why was this study done?
What is atopic dermatitis and plaque psoriasis ?
Atopic dermatitis is a common skin condition that can cause many symptoms, such as 
itching, redness, and a rash that is scaling or oozing.  The symptoms can look 
different on different people.  Atopic dermatitis is also known as eczema.  People 
with atopic dermatitis often have this condition for many years, and may have “flare 
ups”, when their symptoms worsen for a time .  
Plaque psoriasis is acommon type of psoriasis seen by doctors .  People with this 
disease ,also have flare ups where their symptoms worsen .  The s kin,during a flare up ,
is usually redandscaly with raised plaques or patches on the skin .
What is PF-07038124 ?
The study drug (PF -07038124) is an investigational drug because it is not approved 
for use in people with atopic dermatitis or p laque p soriasis. It is applied to the skin as 
an ointment once a day.  The researchers wanted to know if treatment with 
PF-07038124 ointment was able to improve symptoms of atopic dermatitis and 
plaque psoriasis by decreasing inflammation in the skin.  Inflammation is th e body’s 
immune system response, which can lead to the symptoms seen in atopic dermatitis 
and plaque psoriasis.
What was the purpose of this study?
The purpose of this study is to compare the effects of PF -07038124 ointment with a 
plain ointment to see if there are any differences between these ointments when used 
to treat atopic dermatitis or plaque psoriasis. The plain ointment looks and feels like 
the PF-07038124 ointment but does not contain any medicine . 
The researchers compared PF-07038124 ointment with plain ointment by measuring 
the amount and severity o fatopic dermatitis or p laque p soriasis.  Th eydid this by 
calculating the Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI) score or the Psoriasis Area 
and Severity Index (PASI) score .  These measures are used to estimate how much of aperson’s body is affected by atopic dermatitis (EASI score ) or plaque p soriasis (PASI
score )and also theseverity of the atopic dermatitis or plaque psoriasis .  The 
researchers also wanted to find out about the safety of PF -07038124.
Researchers wanted to know:
Did participants using PF -07038124 ointment have less severe 
atopic dermatitis or p laque psoriasis and/or the area affected was 
reduced compared to participants using pl ainointment?
What happened during the study?
How was the study done?
Researchers tested PF-07038124 ointment on a group of study participants to find out 
if study participants treated with this ointment had fewer symptoms of atopic 
dermatitis or plaque psoriasis than participants who used a plain ointment. 
Participants went to the study center to be screened by the study doctor to make sure 
they were able to join the study and to see if they had mild to moderate atopic 
dermatitis or plaque psoriasis .  This was known as the “screening period” and this 
lasted up to 6 weeks .  Participants then entered the treatment period, which started on 
Day 1 and lasted 6 weeks .  During the treatment period, participants were to apply the 
ointment once a day to an area or areas of skin affected by the iratopic dermatitis or 
plaque psoriasis .
The study participants and researchers did not know who used PF -07038124 
ointment and who used the plain ointment. This is known as a “blinded” study.  
Study p articipants were assigned to each group by chance alone.Each participant visited the study center on Day 1, and then on Week 1, Week 2, 
Week 4, and Week 6 .  During these visits, the study doctors assess ed the participant’s 
atopic dermatitis or plaque psoriasis and general health .  Participants were also asked 
to provide blood and urine samples for testing .  Participants were not treated after
Week 6 but were to remain in the study for the next 4 to 5weeks for safety 
monitoring and questioning about their health.  Participants then return edto the 
study center for the final study assessments.
The following figure shows what happened duri ng this study :
Note: Not all participants were available to attend the follow -up visit .
Where did this study take place?
The Sponsor ran this study at 34locations in 4countries in North America, Australia,
and Europe .
When did this study take place?
It began 21December 2020 and ended 18August 2021 .
Who participated in this study?
The study included adult participants who had mild or moderate atopic dermatitis or 
mild or moderate plaque psoriasis. 
A total of 49men participated
A total of 55women participated
All participants were between the ages of 19and70years
Participants were to be treated for 6 weeks . Of the 152participants who were 
screened, 104 participants (70 [67%] with atopic dermatitis and 34 [33%] with plaque 
psoriasis) started the study , 88participants ( 60 [58%] with atopic dermatitis and 
28[27%] with plaque psoriasis) completed treatment ,and 91participants (61 [59%] 
with atopic dermatitis and 30 [29%] with plaque psoriasis) finished the safety follow 
up phase of the study.
There were 16participants (10 [10%] with atopic dermatitis and 6 [6%] with plaque 
psoriasis) who did not finish treatment, and 7 participants (5 [5%] with atopic 
dermatitis and 2 [2%] with plaque psoriasis) who did not finish the safety follow up 
part of the study.  Most p articipants stop pedstudy treatment because of medical 
problems or because they no longer wanted to continue in the study .
How long did the study last?
Study participants were in the study for 16 to17 weeks .  The entire study took just 
over 34 weeks to complete.When the study ended in August 2021 , the Sponsor began reviewing the information 
collected.  The Sponsor then created a report of the results.  This is a summary of that 
report.
What were the results of the study?
Did participants using PF -07038124 ointment have less severe atopic 
dermatitis or plaque psoriasis and/or the area was affected was 
reduced compared to participants using plain ointment ?
Did the PF-07038124 ointment help reduce the symptoms of atopic 
dermatitis compared to p lain ointment?
On average, the least square smean (LSM) for the percentage change in EASI score 
from the start of treatment to Week 6 in participants with atopic dermatitis was
reduc ed by 75% with PF -07038124 compared to 36% with plain ointment (see 
figure below). A lower EASI score means the atopic dermatitis affects a smaller 
area or it is less severe.  T he difference between the treatment groups was 39%.  An 
LSM is a special way of calculating the average in certain types of statistical analysis.
Did the PF -07038124 ointment help reduce the symptoms of plaque 
psoriasis compared to plain ointment?
On average, the LSM for the percentage change in PASI score from the start of 
treatment to Week 6 in participants with plaque psoriasis was reduc ed by 5 % with 
PF-07038124 compared to no change with plain ointment (see figure below). A 
lower PASI score means the plaque psoriasis affects a smaller area or it is less 
severe .  The difference between the treatment groups was 5%.
Based on these results, the researchers have decided that the results are not likely 
the result of chance.  The study medication may h elpreduce some symptoms of 
atopic dermatitis and plaque psoriasis .  
This does not mean that everyone in this study had these results.  This is a summary 
of just some of the main results of this study.  Other studies may have different 
results.
What medical problems did participants have during 
the study?
The researchers recorded any medical problems the participants had during the study.  
Participants could have had medical problems for reasons not related to the study (for 
example, caused by an underlying disease or by chance). Or, medical problem s could 
also have been caused by a study treatment or by another medicine the participant was 
taking. Sometimes the cause of a medical problem is unknown. By comparing 
medical problems across many treatment groups in many studies, doctors try to 
understa nd what effects a study medication might have on a participant.
Twenty -seven (27) out of 104(26%) participants in this study had at least 1 medical 
problem.   There were no participants who stopped using PF -07038124 ointment 
because of medical problems.  T here were 5(10%) participants who stopped using the 
plain ointment because of medical problems.  The most common medical problems –
those reported by 2 or more participants –are described below.
Below are instructions on how to read Table 1.
Instructions for Understanding Table 1. 
The 1stcolumn of Table 1lists medical problems that were commonly 
reported during the study.  All medical problems reported by 2 or more 
participants are listed.
The 2ndcolumn tells how many of the 53participant s in the 
PF-07038124 ointment group with atopic dermatitis or plaque psoriasis 
reported each medical problem.  Next to this number is the percentage 
of the 53participants in the PF -07038124 ointment with atopic 
dermatitis or plaque psoriasis who reported the medical problem. 
The 3rdcolumn tells how many of the 51 participants in the plain 
ointment group with atopic dermatitis or plaque psoriasis reported each 
medical problem.  Next to this number is the percentage of the 51participants in the plain ointment group with atopic dermatitis or 
plaque psoriasis who reported the medical problem.
Using these instructions, you can see that none o f the 53 participants in 
the PF -07038124 group with atopic dermatitis or plaque psoriasis 
reported itching where the ointment was applied . A total of 2out of 
the 51 (4%) participants in the plain ointment with atopic dermatitis or 
plaque psoriasis reported itching where the ointment was applied .
