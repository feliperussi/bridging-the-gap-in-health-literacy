Date(s) of this Report:   14 Jun e2022–Thank You –
If you participated in this study, Pfizer, the Sponsor, would like to thank you for your 
participation. 
This summary will describe the study results.  If you have any questions about the study 
or the results, please contact the doctor or staff at your study site.Why was this study done?
What is non -alcoholic fatty liver disease with type 2 diabetes 
mellitus? 
Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a condition where too much fa t is 
stored in the liver and where those affected drink little to no alcohol.  NAFLD may 
worsen into a condition called non -alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH).  NASH 
develops when excess fat contributes to increased inflammation and liver cell death.  
NASH i s associated with increased risk of death, scarring and failure of the liver, and 
liver cancers.  
Conditions that increase the risk of NAFLD and NASH to develop include being 
overweight, type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), high blood pressure, and high level s of 
cholesterol and fats in the blood.  Participants with T2DM are of special interest and 
included in this study.
What is PF -06835919?
PF-06835919 was the drug investigated in this study in participants who have T2DM 
and may have NAFLD.  PF -06835919 reduces the activity of an enzyme called 
ketohexokinase (KHK).  KHK speeds up the change of fruit sugar (fructose) to 
energy used by the body and increases fat production in the liver.  Fructose increases 
the risk of too much fat in the liver.  PF -06835919 was used as a treatment to lower 
the activity of KHK, reduce liver fat, reduce HbA1c, and prevent the development of 
NASH.  PF -06835919 is a n investigational drug because it is not approved for use in 
this country. 
What were the purposes of this study?
The primary purposes of the study were to compare the effects of PF -06835919 at 
2doses (150 mg and 300 mg) compared with a placebo to find out if PF -06835919 
helps reduce liver fat and hemoglobin A1C (HbA1c).  The amount of HbA1c in the 
blood shows the av erage amount of glucose (a type of sugar) over the past 3 months.  This study looked at the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of 2 doses of PF -06835919 
over a 16 -week period.  Specifically, researchers wanted to know if PF -06835919 
reduced liver fat and H bA1c at 16 weeks compared to placebo (efficacy).  Safety 
means that any medical problems that happened were studied.  Tolerability means 
whether a medical problem interfered with a participant’s usual activities.
What happened during the study?
How was the study done?
This study lasted about 2 4weeks and was in 3 parts: a screening period, a treatment 
period, and a follow -up period.  
The screening period lasted up to 3 weeks and included:
Scans of the liver to test for fat and stiffness
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the liver to measure fat content in the 
liver
Aperiod of taking a placebo for 14 days to make sure participants we re 
comfortable taking a study drug.
The treatment period lasted for 16 weeks.  Participants were randomized (assigned by 
an equal chance) to one of 2 treatment doses of PF -06835919 tablets taken by mouth 
or a placebo tablet taken by mouth.  A total of 164 participants were given one of the 
following during the treatment period:
55 participants: PF -06835919 150 mg Researchers wanted to know: 
Did PF -06835919 reduce the fat in the liver and HbA1c in the blood 
compared to a place bo?55 participants: PF -06835919 300 mg 
54 participants: Placebo 
The follow -up period lasted up to 35 days.  Participants were seen in person at a study 
clinic 7 days to 14 days after their last dose.  Participants received a phone call 
between 28 days to 35 days after their last dose.
Researchers tested PF -06835919 on 2 groups of study participants to find out if 
PF-06835919 lowered the amount of fat in liver cells and lowered HbA1c in the 
blood.  Researchers then compared the results of study participants taking the study 
medication to the results of study participants taking a placebo.  A placebo does not 
have any medicine in it, but it looks jus t like the study medication.
The study participants and researchers did not know who took PF -06835919 and who 
took the placebo.  This is known as a “double -blinded” study.  Study participants were 
assigned to each group by chance alone (randomization).
Thetrial was completed even with the COVID -19 pandemic, and the primary 
objectives of the study were successfully evaluated.  The impact of the pandemic 
enrollment pause was limited, as sites were able to recruit and enroll quickly once sites 
were allowed to restart.  
Where did this study take place? 
The Sponsor ran this study at 58 locations in 2 countries in North America, 
specifically in Canada and the United States.
When did this study take place?
It began 18 July 2019 and ended 30 March 2021.
Who participated in this study?
Requirements for being in the study included:
Male or female participants aged between 18 years and 70 years
Participants with T2DM taking greater than or equal to 500 mg/day 
metformin alone for at least 8 weeks prior screening visit 1
Liver fat content greater than or equal to 8% at screening visit 3 on MRI
Conditions that kept participants out of the study included:
Type 1 diabetes mellitus
Complications from diabetes (kidney or nerve complications)
Participants included:
A total of 71 (43%; 43 out of 100) men participated
A total of 93 (57%; 57 out of 100) women participated
All participants were between the ages of 21 years and 71 years 
Participants were to be treated until Week 16.  Of the 164 participants who started the
study, 145 (88%; 88 out of 100) finished the treatment period.  A total of 19 participants out of 164 (12%; 12 out of 100) discontinued the 
double -blind treatment:
9 (16%; 16 out of 100) participants in the PF -06835919 150 mg group
6 (11%; 11 out of 10 0) participants in the PF -06835919 300 mg group
4 (7%; 7 out of 100) participants in the placebo group 
19 participants out of 164 (12%; 12 out of 100) did not finish the treatment period 
because:
7 participants (4%; 4 out of 100) stopped treatment because of their choice
4 participants (2%; 2 out of 100) stopped treatment because of medical 
problems
4 participants (2%; 2 out of 100) stopped treatment because of other reasons
3 participants (2%; 2 out of 100) stopped treatment because of problems with 
study procedures
1 participant (1%; 1 out of 100) stopped treatment because they were lost to 
follow -up 
How long did the study last?
Study participants were in the study for about 24weeks.  The entire study took 
around 1 year and 8 months to complete.
Due to the COVID -19 pandemic, enrollment in the trial was paused temporarily in all 
sites between 24 March 2020 and 26 May 2020, and then restarted.  
When the study ended in March 2021 the Sponsor began reviewing the information 
collected.  The Sponsor th en created a report of the results.  This is a summary of that 
report.What were the results of the study?
Did PF -06835919 reduce the fat in the liver and HbA1c in the blood 
compared to a placebo?
Both PF -06835919 dose groups (300 mg and 150 mg doses) sh owed greater 
reductions in whole liver fat and HbA1c compared to placebo at Week 16.  For the 
results for whole liver fat, the researchers believe the difference was due to the study 
drug, PF -06835919, (statistically significant) and not due to chance.  Fo r the HbA1c 
results, the researchers could not determine if the results were due to the study drug, 
PF-06835919, or due to chance (not statistically significant).
At Week 16, the average whole liver fat was reduced by:
19% (19 out of 100) for the PF -068359 19 300 mg dose
17% (17 out of 100) for the PF -06835919 150 mg dose
5% (5 out of 100) for the placebo
At Week 16, the average HbA1c was reduced by:
0.34% for the PF -06835919 300 mg dose
0.17% for the PF -06835919 150 mg dose
0.09% for the placebo
This does not mean that everyone in this study had these results.  These are just some 
of the main findings of this study.  Other studies may have different results. 
What medical problems did participants have during 
the study?
The researchers recorded an y medical problems the participants had during the study.  
Participants could have had medical problems for reasons not related to the study (for 
example, caused by an underlying disease or by chance).  Or, medical problems could 
also have been caused by a study treatment or by another medicine the participant was taking.  Sometimes the cause of a medical problem is unknown.  By comparing 
medical problems across many treatment groups in many studies, doctors try to 
understand what effects a study medication might have on a participant.
7 out of 164 (4%; 4 out of 100) participants in this study had at least 
1treatment -related medical problem.  Treatment -related medical problems were 
reported in: 
4 (7%) participants in the PF -06835919 150 mg group
2 (4%) participants in the placebo group
1 (2%) participant in the PF -06835919 300 mg group 
A total of 2 participants stopped PF -06835919 because of medical problems: 
1participant in the PF -06835919 300 mg group and 1 participant in the 
PF-06835919 group stoppe d treatment because of medical problems.  Two 
participants left the study because of medical problems.  The most common medical 
problems –those reported by 2 or more participants –are described below.Below are instructions on how to read Table 1. 
Instructions for Understanding Table 1. 
The 1stcolumn of Table 1 lists medical problems that were commonly 
reported during the study.  All medical problems reported by 2 or 
more participants are listed.
The 2ndcolumn tells how many of the 55 participants taking 
PF-06835919 300 mg reported each medical problem.  Next to this 
number is the percentage of participants taking PF -06835919 300 mg 
who reported the medical problem. 
The 3rdcolumn tells how many of the 55 participants taking 
PF-06835919 150 mg rep orted each medical problem.  Next to this 
number is the percentage of participants taking PF -06835919 150 mg 
who reported the medical problem.
The 4thcolumn tells how many of the 54 participants taking a 
placebo reported each medical problem.  Next to thi s number is the 
percentage of participants taking a placebo who reported the medical 
problem.
Using these instructions, you can see that 4 out of the 55 participants 
(7%) taking PF -06835919 150 mg reported high blood sugar.  A total 
of 0 out of the 54 (0%) participants taking a placebo reported high 
blood sugar.Table 1. Commonly reported medical problems by study

problems?
A medical problem is considered “serious” when it is life -threatening, needs hospital 
care, or causes lasting problems.
2 participants out of 164 ( 1%; 1out of 100) had serious medical problems.  
1 participant out of 55 participants (2%; 2 out of 100) in the 
PF-06835919 150mg group had a serious medical problem of a positive 
COVID -19 test that was not related to PF -06835919.  No participants in the 
PF-06835919 300 mg group had a serious medical problem.
1 participant out of 54 (2%; 2 ou t of 100) participants in the placebo group had 
a serious medical problem of a bleed under the lining of the brain during the 
screening period.  This was not related to PF -06835919.  
No participants died during the study. Where can I learn more about this study?
