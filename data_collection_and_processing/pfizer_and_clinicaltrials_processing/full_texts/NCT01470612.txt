Clinical Study Results
This summary reports the results of only one study. Researchers must look at the 
results of many types of studies to understand if a study medication works, how it 
works, and if it is safe to prescribe to study participants. The results of this study 
might be different than the results of other studies that the researchers review.

Why was this study done?
What is ulcerative colitis?
Ulcerative colitis (“UC”) is a long -term inflammatory bowel disease that causes
inflammation (swelling) and ulcers (sores) in the digestive tract. UC affects the
mucosa (inner lining) of the large intestine (colon) and rectum. Patients with UC
experience occasional periods of increased inflammation, known as flares. Flares are
characterized by diarrhea (loose stools) and presence of blood in the stools, as well as
sense of urgency. Flares are followed by periods of remission (time with no
symptoms) that vary in length from weeks to years.
There is no known cure for UC. Treatment can greatly reduce signs and symptoms of
UC and can even lead to long -term remission. However, there are few treatment
options for patients with moderately to severely active UC. Medication is the most
common treatment for UC. 
What is tofacitinib?
Tofacitinib is a medicine that works to reduce the activity of the immune system. It is 
an oral (taken by mouth) medication that has been approved, and is available by 
prescription, to treat adults with active, moderate to severe UC that did not respond 
well to other medications.
What was the purpose of this study?
Researchers did this study to learn more about the safety of tofacitinib in participants 
with UC when taken over a long period of time .
Researchers wanted to know: 
How many participants had medical problems during this study?

What happened during the study?
How was the study done?
Participants were checked (screened) to make sure they were a good fit for the study. 
Participants who were a good fit were assigned to receive either tofacitinib 
5milligrams (mg) or tofacitinib 10 mg twice per day by mouth , depending on whether 
they had UC symptoms when this study started.  Participants with no symptoms 
(known as being “in remission”) received tofacitinib 5 mg, and participants with 
symptoms received tofacitinib 10 mg.  The dose could be adjusted during the study, if 
needed.  
This was an “open -label” study, which means that the participants and doctors knew 
which treatment and dose they received.  
Participants were expected to attend visits at the study center every 3 months, and 
complete a 4 -week follow -up period after they finished study treatment.
The figure below shows what happened during this study.

Where did this study take place? 
The Sponsor ran this study at 298 locations in 31 countries in Africa, Asia, 
Australia/New Zealand, Europe, North America, and South America.
When did this study take place?
It began on 1 October 2012 and ended on 6 August 2020. 
Who participated in this study?
This study included adult m en and women who:
Had moderate to severe UC
Had participated in a previous study with tofacitinib
Had not had surgery for UC and were not likely to need surgery for UC during 
the study
Did not have other bowel diseases, such as Crohn’s disease, infectious colitis, 
or colon cancer
A total of 555 men participated
A total of 389 women participated  
All participants were between the ages of 18 and 81 
Participants could continue taking study treatment as long as they continued to 
benefit from it, or until the study ended.  Of the 944 participants who started the 
study and received treatment, 195 completed it.  
A total of 749 participants stopped taking study treatment early
by their choice, 
because they did not see significant improvement in UC symptoms, 
because they had a medical problem ,
because a doctor decided it was best for them to stop the study, 
because they switched to a different study ,
or because tofacitinib became available by prescription in their country (Japan)

How long did the study last?
The amount of time that each participant was in this study varied. The entire study 
took almost 8 years to complete.
When the study ended in August 2020, the Sponsor began reviewing the information 
collected.  The Sponsor then created a report of the results.  This is a summary of that 
report.
What medical problems did participants have during 
the study?
The researchers recorded any medical problems t he participants had during the study.  
Participants could have had medical problems for reasons not related to the study (for 
example, caused by an underlying disease or by chance).  Or, medical problems could 
also have been caused by a study treatment or by another medicine the participant was 
taking.  Sometimes the cause of a medical problem is unknown.  By comparing 
medical problems across many treatment groups in many studies, doctors try to 
understand what effects a study medication might have on a par ticipant.
780 out of 944 (83%) participants in this study had at least 1 medical problem.
154 out of 175 (88%) participants who received tofacitinib 5 mg had a medical 
problem.
626 out of 769 (81%) participants who received tofacitinib 10 mg had a medical 
problem.
A total of 196 out of 944 (21%) participants left the study because of medical 
problems.
30 out of 175 (17%) participants who received tofacitinib 5 mg left the study 
because of a medical problem.
166 out of 769 (22%) participants who received tofacitinib 10 mg left the study 
because of a medical problem.

The most common medical problems –those reported by at least 10% of participants 
–are described below.
Below are instructions on how to rea d Table 1. 
Instructions for Understanding Table 1. 
The 1stcolumn of Table 1 lists medical problems that were commonly 
reported during the study.  All medical problems reported by at least
10% of participants are listed.
The 2ndcolumn tells how many of the 175 participants taking 
tofacitinib 5 mg reported each medical problem.  Next to this number 
is the percentage of the 175 participants taking tofacitinib 5 mg who 
reported the medical problem. 
The 3rdcolumn tells how many of the 769 participants taking 
tofacitinib 10 mg reported each medical problem.  Next to this number 
is the percentage of the 769 participants taking tofacitinib 10 mg who 
reported the medical problem.
Using these instructions, you c an see that 41 out of the 175 (23%) 
participants taking tofacitinib reported a common cold.  A total of 15 7
out of 769 (20%) participants taking tofacitinib 10 mg reported 
common cold.
