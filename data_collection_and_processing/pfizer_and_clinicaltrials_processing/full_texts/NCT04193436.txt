This summary will describe the study results.  If you have any questions about the study 
or the results, please contact the doctor or staff at your stu dy site.Why was this study done?
What is hepatic impairment?
Hepatic impairment means that a person’s liver is not functioning normally.  The liver 
plays an important role in keeping the body healthy, including helping to digest food 
and helping to remov e substances such as medicines or their byproducts from the 
body .  People with hepatic impairment may not be able to remove some substances
from the body as well as people with normal liver function. 
What is PF -06835919?
PF-06835919 is an investigational drug being studied for the possible treatment of a 
type of liver disease.  An investigational drug is one that has not been approved for 
use outside of research studies.  PF-06835919 is a pill that is taken daily by mouth.
What was the purpose of this study?
The purpose of this study was to compare how PF -06835919 moved through the 
body and how long it stayed in the body in participants with varying levels of hepatic 
impairment and in participants with normal liver function. After P F-06835919 was 
swallowed, it entered the body (through the stomach and intestine )and moved 
through the body.  PF -06835919 entered the blood and organs (for example liver) 
when it moved through the body.  Afterwards, PF -06835919 was removed from the 
body t hrough urine and feces.
This study did not test if PF-06835919 helps to treat liver disease.
Researchers wanted to know:
How did PF -06835919 act in the body of participants with 
varying levels of hepatic impairment, compared to 
participants with normal liver function?What medical problems did participants have during the 
study?
What happened during the study? 
How was the study done?
Researchers tested PF-06835919 on a group of participants with varying levels of 
hepatic impairment and on a group of participants with normal liver function and 
similar age, gender, and weight as the participants with hepatic impairment, to learn 
how hepatic impairment affected the way that PF-06835919 acted in the body.
In this study, participants received a single dose by mouth of PF -06835919 25 mg, 
taken after breakfast. This was an open -label study, which means that the participants 
and the researchers knew what treatment the participants received.
Researchers took samples of blood from participants during the study and measured 
the amount of PF-06835919 . Researchers then compared the blood samples from 
participants with hepatic impairment and those with normal liver function.   
Researchers also checked the participants’ health during the study and asked them 
how they were feeling. There was a 30-day follow -up visit at the end of the study.
Where did this study take place? 
The Sponsor ran this study at 3 locations in Belgium, Czech Republic, and Slovakia.
When did this study take place?
It began 21 January 2020 and ended 9 July 2021.Who participated in this study?
Participants between the ages of 18 and 75 years could join this study.  Participants 
could not have another me dical condition that might affect the way that medicines 
move through the body (for example, a past weight -loss surgery), and had to agree to 
certain lifestyle guidelines, such as avoiding alcohol during the study.
Participants with hepatic impairment were selected based on the severity of their 
disease (mild, moderate, or severe hepatic impairment).  They had to have stable 
disease with no major change in hepatic impairment within the last 28 days, and a 
stable medi cation/treatment regimen.  Participants with normal liver function were 
then selected for the study based on gender, age, and weight, so that they would have 
similar characteristics to the participants with hepatic impairment.   
A total of 16 men (70%) an d 7 women (30%) participated
All participants were between the ages of 38 and 73, with a n average age of 6 1
Sixparticipants (26%) had mild hepatic impairment, 6 participants (26%) had 
moderate hepatic impairment, 5 participants (22%) had severe hepatic 
impairment, and 6 participants (26%) had normal liver function.
All 23 participants (100%) who started the study finished it.
How long did the study last?
Study participants were in the study for about 5 to 9 weeks. The entire study took 
about 1 ½ years to complete and was completed as planned.
When the study ended in July 2021, the Sponsor began reviewing the information 
collected.  The Sponsor then created a report of the results.  This is a summary of that 
report.What were the results of the study?
How did PF -06835919 act in the body of participants with varying 
levels of hepatic impairment, compared to participants with normal 
liver function ? 
To answer this question, the researchers compared blood tests from participants with 
varying levels of hepatic impairment and those with normal liver function.
How much of PF-06835919 was “unbound”?
After a drug is swallowed and enters the blood, some of the drug attaches to 
proteins within the blood.  This is known as drug “binding”.  When a new 
investigational d rug is being developed, researchers are interested in learning how 
much of the drug does not bind to proteins, which is known as being “unbound”.  
Only the amount of drug that remains unbound can have therapeutic effects on the 
body and then be removed by the liver.  
In this study, about 4% of PF-06835919 was unbound in participants with normal 
liver function, and about 6% was unbound in participants with hepatic impairment.  
Figure 1 below shows this result in participants with varying levels of hepatic 
impairment compared to those with normal liver function.What was the highest amount of PF-06835919 measured in the 
blood after a single dose?
Figure 2 below shows the highest amount of PF -06835919 measured in the blood 
after a single dose in participants with varying levels of hepatic impairment 
compared to those with normal liver function.  The amount of PF -06835919 in the 
blood was measured in nanograms per milliliter, also called ng/mL.  
What was the highest amount of unbound PF-06835919 measured 
in the blood after a single dose?
Figure 3 below shows the highest amount of unbound PF -06835919 measured in 
the blood after a single dose in participants with varying levels of hepatic 
impairment compared to those with normal liver function.  The amount of 
PF-06835919 in the blood was measured in nanograms per milliliter, also called 
ng/mL.  
What was the estimated overall amount of PF-068359 19 in the blood 
after a single dose ?
The estimated overall amount of PF -06835919 in the blood after a single dose in 
participants with varying levels of hepatic impairment compared to those with 
normal liver function is shown in Figure 4 below.  Theestimated overall amount of 
PF-06835919 in the blood was measured in nanogram hours per milliliter , also 
called ng•hr/mL .  
What was the estimated overall amount of unbound PF-06835919 in 
the blood after a single dose ?
The estimated overall amount of unbound PF -06835919 in the blood after a single 
dose in participants with varying levels of hepatic impairment compared to those 
with normal liver function is shown in Figure 5 below.  The estimated overall
amount of unbound PF -06835919 in the blood was measured in nanogram hours 
per milliliter , also called ng•hr/mL .  
This does not mean that everyone in this study had these results.  This is a summary 
of just some of the main results of this study.  Other studies may have dif ferent 
results.
What medical problems did participants have during 
the study?
The researchers recorded any medical problems the participants had during the study.  
Participants could have had medical problems for reasons not related to the study (for 
exam ple, caused by an underlying disease or by chance).  Or, medical problems could 
also have been caused by a study treatment or by another medicine the participant was 
taking.  Sometimes the cause of a medical problem is unknown.  By comparing 
medical proble ms across many treatment groups in many studies, doctors try to 
understand what effects a study medication might have on a participant.
A total of 2 out of 23 participants (9%) in this study had at least 1 medical problem: 
1 participant with moderate hepatic impairment had stomach discomfort, 
upper stomach pain, nausea, and nosebleed.  The study doctor considered 
upper stomach pain and nausea to be related to PF -06835919.
1 participant with severe hepatic impairment had swelling caused by a blood 
clot in the vein, which was not considered to be related to PF -06835919.
No participants left the study because of medical problems.  
Did study participants have any serious medical 
problems?
A medical problem is considered “serious” when it is life-threatening, needs hospital 
care, or causes lasting problems.  No participants in this study had serious medical 
problems, and no participants died during the study.
