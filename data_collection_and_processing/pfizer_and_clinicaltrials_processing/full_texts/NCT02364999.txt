2WHY WAS THIS STUDY DONE?
Lung cancer is the name for cancer that starts in the lungs.  Non -small cell lung 
cancer (NSCLC) is the most common type of lung cancer.  
Avastin®is one medicine that is c urrently used to treat NSCLC.  Avastin may sto p 
cancer tumors from growing. PF-06439 535 is a medicine that is made to be similar to 
Avastin , and is being studied as a possible treatment for many cancers.  In this specific
study, Avastin wa sstudied for NSCLC.  The purpose of making a medicine similar to 
Avastin is to give patients another treatment option.  
A committee of doctors have reviewed the data and recommended that PF -06439535 
be approved for use in Europe.  PF -06439535 is still being tested a nd has not been 
approved for use in other regions.
The main goal of this study was to determine if PF -06439535 works in a similar way 
to Avastin. Patients in this study also received 2 other medicines for NSCLC, called 
paclitaxel and carboplatin.  Researchers wanted to know: 
At week 19 of the study , how many patients who took PF -06439535 would 
have a reduction in tumor size (tumor getting smaller) , compared to patients 
who tookAvastin ? 
WHAT HAPPENED DURING THE STUDY?
This study compared 2 groups of patients taking either PF-06439535 plus paclitaxel 
and carboplatin or Avastin plus paclitaxel and carboplatin , to determine if 
PF-06439535 works in a similar way to Avastin .The study included adult patients 
with either newly diagnosed or recurring NSCLC .  For patients with recurring 
NSCLC, the last systemic treatment (a treatment that affects the whole body) should 
have been received at least 6 months ago.   The patients and researchers did not know 
who took which medicines .  This is known as a “blin ded” stu dy.  
Patients were screened by the study doctor to make sure they were a good fit to join 
the study.  This was known as the “screening pe riod”, which lasted up to 28 days.  
Next, patients were assigned to receive either PF-06439535 plus paclitaxel and 
090177e1907170fa\Approved\Approved On: 04-Mar-2019 01:04 (GMT)
3carboplatin or Avastin plus paclitaxel and carboplatin.  Patients were assigned to each 
group by chance alone.  Putting people into groups by chance helps to make the 
groups more even to compare.
The medicines were given by IV infusion (a needle into the vein).   During the first 
part of this study, patients received 4 to 6 infusions of either PF-06439535 plus 
paclitaxel and carboplatin or Avastin plus paclitaxel and carboplatin .  The infusions 
were given once every 21 days.   
During the second part of this study, paclitaxel and carboplatin were stopped, and the 
infusions included only PF-06439535 or Avastin .  This lasted until the end of the 
study.   Finally, there was a follow -up period, which lasted for 28 days after the 
patients finished taking study treatment.
The figure below shows what happened during this study.
Patients were considered to have completed the study at 1 year, although some 
patients were in the study longer than 1 year.   The entire study took more than 
2½years to complete.  The sponsor ran this study at 216locations in Africa, Asia, 
090177e1907170fa\Approved\Approved On: 04-Mar-2019 01:04 (GMT)
4Australia, Europe, North America, and South America (however, no patients joined 
the study at 57 of these locations ).  It began 20 April 2015 and ended 
22December 2017.  467men (65%)and 252women (35%) participated.  All patients 
were between the ages of 25 and 87 . 
Patients were to be treated for 1 year and complete the 28 day follow -up period . A 
total of 719 patients joined the study, but only 714 received study treat ment.  Of the se 
714 patients ,380(53%) finished the study .  There were 334 patients who left before
the study was over by their choice or a doctor decided it was best for a patient to stop 
the study , or because they passed away .
When the study ended in December 2017 , the Sponsor began reviewing the 
infor mation collected.  The Sponsor then cr eated a report of the results. This is a 
summary of that report.
WHAT WERE THE RESULTS OF THE STUDY?
At week 19 of the study, how many patients who took 
PF-0643953 5 had a reduction in tumor size, compared to 
patients who took Avastin ?
At week 19 of the study, 162 patients (45%) in the PF -06439535 group had a 
reduction in tumor size.  161 patients (45%) in the Avastin group had a reduction in 
tumor size. The researchers have decided that these results are not likely based on 
chance.  PF-06439535 may work in a similar way to Avastin, and may be an option for 
treating NSCLC.
The figure on the following page shows the results of the study.

5This does not me an that everyone in this study had these results . Other studies may 
produce different results , as well .  These are just some of the main findings of the 
study, and more information may be available at the websites listed at the end of this 
summary.  
WHAT MEDICAL PROBLEMS DID PATIENTS
HAVE DURING THE STUDY?
The researchers recorded any medical problems the patients had during the study. 
Patients could have had medical problems for reasons not related to the study (for 
example, caused by an underlying disease or by chance). Or, medical problems could 
also have been caused by a study treatment, or by another medicine the patient was 
taking. Sometimes the cause of a medical problem is unknown. By comparing 
medical problems across many treatment groups in many studies, doctors try to 
understand what the side effects of an experimental drug might be.
Of the 714 patients who received study treatment, 661 (93 %) patients had at least 
1medical problem .A total of 171(24%)patients left the study because of medical 
problems.  The most common medical problems are listed below.

8WERE THERE ANY SERIOUS MEDICAL 
PROBLEMS?
A medical problem is considered “serious” when it is life -threatening, needs hospital 
care, or causes lasting problems .  
A total of 161out of 714 patients (23%) who received study treatment had serious 
medical problems , including 81 patients (23%) in the PF-06439535 group and 
80patients (22%) in the Avastin group.
A total of 45 patients died during the study, including 21 patients (6%) in the 
PF-06439535 group and 24 patients (7%) in the Avastin group.  Most of these deaths 
were due to NSCLC, but study doctors determined that 6 of these deaths were related 
to study treatment.
