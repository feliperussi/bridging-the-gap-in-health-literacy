–Thank You –If you participated in this study, Pfizer, the Sponsor, would like to thank you for your 
participation. 
This summary will describe the study results.  If you have any questions about the study 
or the results, please contact the doctor or staff at your stu dy site.Why was this study done?
What is moderate to severe plaque psoriasis?
Moderate to severe plaque psoriasis is a skin disease characterized by red, scaly, raised 
patches (plaques) that may itch or burn .  Moderate to severe plaque psoriasis can 
greatly affect the quality of life for patients. 
In clinical trials, psoriasis is measured using a tool called Psoriasis Area and Severity 
Index (PASI). PASI measures plaque psoriasis using the following items:
Amount of the body (body surfa ce area [BSA]) that has patches (plaques)
Redness of patches 
Thickness of patches
Level (degree) of scaling (extra flaky skin)
What is PF -06826647 ?
The study medication, PF -06826647, is a medication that researchers think may help 
with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis. PF-06826647 blocks a small protein (called 
tyrosine kinase 2; TYK2) that may cause inflammation and skin patches. When there 
are too many TYK2 proteins, inflammation and skin patches develop, as seen in 
psoriasis.
What was the purpose o f this study?
The primary purpose of this study was to compare the efficacy of multiple dose 
levels of PF -06826647 versus placebo.  Efficacy means how well a drug 
improves a disease or condition. This study measured the proportion (how 
many out of the tot al) of participants with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis 
who had a reduction in their patches by 90% (90 out of 100) from the 
beginning of the study to Week 16.  This measurement is called PASI90 (that 
means 90% or more PASI score reduction) for this study. This study compared the effects of the study drug ,PF-06826647 ,or a placebo 
to find out which improves moderate to severe plaque psoriasis.
Otherpurposes of this study were to provide additional safety and 
pharmacokinetic (PK ) data. PK data means what amount of PF-06826647 was 
in the blood at various times.
Previous studies of PF-06826647 showed adequate safety and improvement of 
plaque psoriasis to support progression into additional clinical trials requiring 
longer term the rapy. This study explored whether an oral tablet containing 
PF-06826647 improves the signs and symptoms of moderate to severe 
psoriasis.
A placebo was used as the comparator to the study drug. A placebo does not 
have any medicine in it, but it looks just like the study medicine .
What happened during the study?
How was the study done?
Researchers tested PF-06826647 in groups of study participants during 2 periods of 
time: an Investigational Treatment Period ( Weeks 0-16) and an Extension Treatment 
Period ( Weeks 16 -40). 
Participants were randomized to receive placebo or 1 of 4 doses of study 
medication (PF-06826647 , oral daily dose of 50 mg, 100 mg, 200 mg, or 
400mg)during the Investigational Treatment Period for up to 16 weeks. 
Randomization means that participants were assigned to a treatment group by 
chance. Twice as many p articipants were assigned to the placebo, PF-06826647
200 mg ,or PF-06826647 400 mg groups compared to the PF-06826647 50 mg 
or PF -06826647 100 mg groups .
During the Investigational Treatment Period, the study participants and 
researchers did not know who took PF -06826647 orwho t ook the placebo.  
This is known as a “blinded” study.  Study participants were assigned to each 
group by chance alone. The treatmen t doses in the Extension Treatment 
Period were also randomized and blinded .All participants completing the 16 -week Investigational Treatment Period and 
who were able to continue to the24-week Extension Treatment Period ( which 
was from Week 16 to Week 40) received oral daily doses of PF-06826647
(either 200 mg or 400 mg ).  There was no placebo in the Extension Treatment 
Period.
The participants continuing into the Extension Treatment Period who were 
originally assigned to the PF-06826647 200 mg and PF-06826647 400 mg 
treatment groups continued to receive their same doses. 
Participants who received placebo, PF-06826647 50 mg, or PF-06826647 
100mg in the Investigational Treatment Period were randomly assigned to 
receive either PF-06826647 200 mg or PF-06826647 4 00 mg during the 
Extension Treatment Period . 
Researchers then compared the results of study participants taking the study 
medication to the results of study participants taking a placebo .  
Study Design
Where did this study take place? 
The Sponsor ran this study at 36 locations in 4 countries in North America, Europe, 
and Asia. The study locations were in Canada (7 locations), Japan (6 locations), 
Poland (6 locations), and the United States (17 locations ).
When did this study take place?
It began on 27 June 2019 and ended on26 November 2020.
Who participated in this study?
The study included participants who were adults at least 18 years old, were diagnosed 
with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis for at least 6 months, and had stopped other 
psoriasis treatments.
A total of 122 men participated (6 9% of participants)
A total of 56 women participated (3 1% of participants)
All participants were between the ages of 18 years old and 72 years old
Participants were to be treated in the Investigational Treatment Period until Week 16.  
Of the 179 participants who started the study, 153 participants (8 5%) finished the 
Investigational Treatment Period.  One (1) participant of the 179 participants who 
started the study was not treated and is not counted in the number who were treated; 
178 participants were treated in the Investigational Treatment Period. 
25 participants (14%) did not finish the Investigat ional Treatment Period because:
8 participants ( 4%) had a medical problem 
3participants (2%) left before the study was over for other reasons
1 participant (1%) did not respond to the study medication
1 participant (1%) was lost to follow -up
1 participan t (1%) had an unplanned change to the study design
11 participants (6%) left before the study was over by their choice or a doctor 
decided it was best for a participant to stop being in the study.
A total of 153 participants entered the Extension Treatment Period (Week 16 to 
Week 40).  A total of 152 of these participants were treated in the Extension 
Treatment Period , and 130(85%) participants completed the Extension Treatment 
Period.
23 participants (13 %) did not finish the Extension Treatment Period because:8 participants ( 5%) had a medical problem 
1 participant (1%) left because of pregnancy 
7participants (4 %) left before the study was o ver by their choice 
7 participants (4%) left before the study was over for other reasons
How long did the study last?
Study participants were in the study for 16 weeks during the Investigational Treatment 
Period and 24 weeks during the Extension Treatment Period for a total of 40 weeks , 
plus a screening period of up to 6 weeks and a follow -up period of 4 weeks . The 
entire study took about 1½ years to complete.
The study was completed as planned, including during the Covid -19 pandemic 
period .
7 participants left the study during the Covid -19 pandemic period (2 in the 
Investigational Treatment Period and 5 durin g the Extension Treatment 
Period); the data from these 7 participants were not analyzed for this report.
5 participants reported missed doses or delayed doses due to the pandemic.
When the study ended in November 2020, the Sponsor began reviewing the 
infor mation collected.  The Sponsor then created a report of the results.  This is a 
summary of that report .
What were the results of the study?
What proportion of participants with moderate to severe plaque 
psoriasis taking PF-06826647 achieved PASI90, compared to 
participants taking placebo?
PASI90 for this study means a response greater than or equal to a 90% (90 out of 
100) reduction in the PASI score from the beginning of the study compared with 
PASI90 at Week 16. Did the study med ication help participants achieve PASI90 
compared to placebo at Week 16?
Yes.  The results are described below and shown in the graph on the next page.
21 participants out of 41 (51%) participants who took PF-06826647 400 mg
achieved PASI90 response ;
17 participants out of 45 (38%) participants who took PF-06826647 200 mg 
achieved PASI90 response ;
2 participants out of 21 (10%) participants who took PF-06826647 100 mg 
achieved PASI90 response;
3 participants out of 22 (14%) participants who took PF-06826647 50 mg 
achieved PASI90 response;
2 out of 42 (5%) participants who took placebo achieved PASI90 response.
Based on these results, the researchers have decided that the results for participants 
taking PF-06826647 400 mg or 200 mg were not likely the result of chance.  The 
study medication at 400 mg or 200 mg doses may help participants with moderate 
to severe plaque psoriasis achieve PASI90 response .  
The results for participants taking PF-06826647 100 mg or 50 mg were similar to
placebo and may be the result of chance.   This means the study results for 
participants taking PF-06826647 100 mg or 50 mg did not show that one treatment 
was better than another at helpingparticipants with moderate to severe plaque 
psoriasis achieve PASI90response .Proportion of Participants Achieving PASI90 Response at Week 16
What medical problems did participants have during 
the study?
The researchers recorded any medical problems the participants had during the study.  
Participants could have had medical problems for reasons not related to the study (for 
example, caused by an underlying disease or by chance).  Ormedical problems could 
also have been caused by a study treatment or by another medicine the participant was 
taking.  Sometimes the cause of a medical problem is unknown.  By comparing 
medical problems across many treatment groups in many studies, doctors try to 
understand what effects a study medication might have on a participant.
A total of 109 out of 178 (61%) participants during the Investigational Treatment 
Period had at least 1 medical problem.  A total of 9 participants (5%) left the study 
during the Investigational Treatment Period because of medical problems.  The most 
common medical problems –those reported by more than 3 participants –are 
described in the table below:Below are instructions on how to read Table 1 and Table 2 .

Did study participants have any serious medical 
problems?
A medical problem is considered “serious” when it is life -threatening, needs hospital 
care, or causes lasting problems.   During the Investigational Treatment Period , 
2participants out of 178 participants (1%, or 1 out of 100 participants) had serious 
medical problems.  
During the I nvestigational Treatment Period:
o1 participant in the PF-06826647 50 mg group had a serious medical 
problem of temporary ,limited hearing loss .  Researchers did not think 
this was related to PF-06826647 .
o1 participant in the PF-06826647 200 mg group had a serious medical 
problem of chest pain with increased blood pressure and nervous system 
symptoms.  Researchers thought th is was related to PF-06826647 . 
Noparticipants in the placebo group had a serious medical problem during the 
Investigational Treatment Period.
