2WHY WAS THIS STUDY DONE?
A seizure is a sudden increase in electrical activity in the brain.  Epilepsy is when 2 or 
more seizures occur that are separated by at least a day ,and for which there is not 
cause for the seizure which can be corrected. Seizures can take on many different 
forms, can cause many different symptoms, and vary from person to person. 
Seizure s ymptoms can include a feeling or warning that a seizure is about to occur, a 
temporary loss of consciousness ,or a feeling of being confused .The initial symptoms 
may also progress to shaking of the arms and legs . “Partial onset seizure s”,also 
known as focal seizures, are a common type of seizure. This type of seizure begins in 
only one part of the brain. This study included children with partial onset seizures.   
There are medicines that are available that can be used to stop or control seizures in 
children, but these medicines may not work well for all children and they may not be 
tolerated well .  Therefore, researchers are interested in finding additional treatment 
options for children with epilepsy (seizures).  
Pregabalin is a medicine that may be used as an “add -on” treatment for children with 
epilepsy, which means that the medicine is given along with other epilepsy medicines
that the child is already receiving .  Pregabalin is currently approved in the United 
States only for older children (at least 4 years of age) with partial onset seizures. 
Pregabalin is not approved in any country for the add -on treatment of partial onset 
seizures in children 1 month to younger than 4 years of age.   This study was done to 
learn more about using pregabalin as add -on therapy in these younger children with 
partial onset seizures.
For this study, researchers wanted to answer the following question: 
Would pregabalin reduce the frequency of partial onset seizures , compared to 
placebo ?
WHA T HAPPENED DURING THE STUDY?
This study compared 3groups of children to find out if those taking 1 of 2 different 
doses of pregabalin would have less frequent seizures, compared to children taking a 
placebo.  A placebo does not have any medicine in it, but looks just like the medicine.

3The study included children who were at least 1 month old but younger than 4 years 
old when the study started.  All children in this study had partial onset seizures and 
were currently taking medicine for epilepsy .The children received 1of 3treatments 
in this study randomly (like flipping a coin) and none of the patients , parents ,or 
researchers knew who took pregabalin and w ho took the placebo.  This is known as a 
“blinded” study.  
First, the study doctor checked each child to make sure that they met the 
requirements to join the study.  This was called screening.  Children who were found 
to be a good fit for the study came t o a baseline visit that lasted 2 to 3days, where 
they were given a test called a video EEG.  A video EEG measures brain activity and 
is used to provide a measure of seizure frequency.   Children who had at least 2 partial
onset seizures during the baseline video EEG could continue in the study.
Children were then randomly assigned to 1 of 3 treatment s during the study :
Pregabalin 7 milligrams (mg) per kilogram (kg) of weight per day (71 children)
Pregabalin 14 mg per kg of weight per day (34 children)
Placebo (70 children)
The dose of study medication was gradually increased from a starting dose to the 
study dose over the first 5 days of the study .  Next, the dose of study medication was 
kept the same over the next 9 days.  The children then came to another visit at which 
the video EEG testing was repeated over 2 to 3 days .  Last, study medication was 
gradually decreased.   Children continued taking their other medications for epilepsy 
throughout the study.
The chart below sho ws what happened during the study.

4Each individual child was in the study for about 3weeks . Overall, the entire study 
took about 3 ½years to complete because the children did not all start at the same 
time.  Children joined the study at 1 of 113 locations in 29countries in Africa, Asia, 
Europe, North America, and South America .  It began 16September 2014 and ended
13 March 2018 .  A total of 103boys and 72 girls were enrolled in the study .
Out of the 175 children who started the study, 169 chi ldren (97%) finished it.  A total 
of 6 children (3%) left before the study was over , either because the parent/guardian 
chose for the child to leave, or because a doctor decided it was best for the child to 
stop the study.   When the study ended in March 2018, the Sponsor began reviewing 
the information collected.  The Sponsor then created a report of the results.  This is a 
summary of that report.
WHAT WERE THE RESULTS OF THE STUDY?
Did pregabalin reduce the frequency of partial onset 
seizures, compared t o placebo ?
To answer this question, the researchers determined each child’s 24-hour seizure rate 
(the number of partial onset seizures in a 24 -hour period) from the video EEG tests .  
Pregabalin a tthe 14 mg per kg per day dose significantly reduced the frequency of 
partial onset seizures compared to placebo.  Pregabalin a tthe 7 mg per kg per day 
dose did not significantly reduce the frequency of partial onset seizures compared to 
placebo .  The comparis on to placebo is how researchers determi ne if a new medicine 
works for epilepsy. The chart on the following page shows the average reduction in 
24-hour seizure rate for children in each treatment group.

5WHAT MEDICAL PROBLEMS DID CHILDREN
HAVE DURING THE STUDY ?
The researchers recorded any medical problems the children had during the study. 
Children could have had medical problems for reasons not related to the study (for 
example, caused by an underlying disease). Or, medical problems could also have 
been caused by a study treatment, or by another medicine the child was taking. 
Sometimes the cause of a medical problem is unknown. By comparing medical 
problems across many treatment groups in many studies, doctors t ry to understand 
what the side effects of an experimental drug might be.
Out of 175 children in this study, 51 children (29%) had at least 1 medical problem. 
The most common  medical problems reported in children in this study are listed on 
the following page.

WERE THERE ANY SERIOUS MEDICAL

A medical problem is considered “serious” when it is life -threatening, causes lasting 
problems, or needs hospital care.

7Out of 175 children in this study, 5 children (3%) had serious medical problems.  
There were 4 children in the placebo group and 1 child in the pregabalin 14 mg per kg
per day group who had a serious medical problem.  No children died during the study.
