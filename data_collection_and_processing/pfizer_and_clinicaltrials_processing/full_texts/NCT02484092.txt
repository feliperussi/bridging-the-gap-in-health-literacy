CLINICAL TRIAL RESULTS
This summary reports the results of only one study.  Researchers must look at the 
results of many types of studies to understand if a study medicine works, how it 
works, and if it is safe to prescribe to patients.  The results of this study might be 
different than the results of other studies that the researchers review.

2WHY WAS THIS STUDY DONE?
Hemophilia is a disease that is “inherited”, which means it runs in famil ies, and it 
mainly affects boys and men.  People with hemophilia have problems with their blood 
not clotting.  After an injury, someone with hemophilia will bruise more easily and, if 
cut, will bleed for longer.  Sometimes the bleeding can happen inside th e body and 
this “internal bleeding” can be serio us as it can cause damage.
Doctors prescribe medicines called “factor replacement therapy” to help the blood to 
clot in people with hemophilia.  These treatments work by replacing the clotting 
factors that ar e missing from the blood of a person with hemophilia.  Clotting factors 
are proteins in the blood that help stop bleeding after an injury as well as prevent 
bleeding from happening.  There are many different clotting factors in the blood and 
these are numb ered using Roman numerals.  People with hemophilia B are missing 
Factor IX (9) (FIX) .  This means FIX is given to people with hemophilia B.  Factor 
replacement therapy is given by “infusion” where the medicine is prepared in a 
syringe and then “injected” o r pushed through a patient’s skin into a “vein”.  A vein is 
a tube that carries blood around the body.  Other treatments are also available that 
can be given by “injection”, or a shot, “subcutaneously”, to prevent or reduce the 
number of bleeding episodes (also known as bleeds).  Subcutaneously means the 
injection is g iven just underneath the skin.
Fidanacogene elaparvovec is a new kind of treatment being studied for hemophilia.  It 
works in a different way to other treatments to help blood to clot.  Fidana cogene 
elaparvovec is a novel recombinant adeno -associated virus (AAV), which in nature 
causes no disease, to deliver the human factor IX (hFIX) gene to the liver ce lls where 
FIX is normally made.
For this study, researchers were interested in learning abo ut the safety and kinetics 
(movement through the body) of a single dose of fidanacogene elaparvovec where it 
may help to prevent or reduce the number of bleeding episode s.

3WHAT HAPPENED DURING THE STUDY?
Researchers in t his study initially intended to look at 3 groups of patients treated with
fidanacogene elaparvovec at 1 of 3 dose levels .  This was done to see if patients had 
any medical problems after this treatment and also see if this treatment could prevent 
bleeding episodes.  Fidanacogene elaparvo vecwas given as an intravenous ( IV)
infusion, which means that a needle is placed in the vein and the study drug slowly 
drips into the vein .
A total of 22 patient s were screened, 15 patients received fidanacogene elaparvovec . 
All 15 patients received the lowest dose in the study (5 x 1011vg/kg). No patient 
received the 2 higher dose sof fidanacogene elaparvovec . Results presented here are 
from the lowest dose level.
Patients were treated with 100 IU/kg of their us ual FIX protein product ov er more or 
less 10minutes at Day 0 visit. After this , the patients were treated with fidanacogene 
elaparvovec (5 x 1011vg/kg) for approximately 60 minutes via infusion pump , as 
shown in the figure below .
This was an open -label study, so everyone, including the patient, knew what treatment 
was given . 
The study included patients who were men of 18years of age and older with less than 
or equal to 2% FIX levels.

4While patients were only in the study for 1year, the entire study took more than
3yearsto complete.  The Sponsor ran this study at 5locations in 2countries 
(Australia and United States) .  It began 18November 2015 and ended 08April 2019.  
All patient s were men .  All patients were between the ages of 18and 61years .
Patients were to be treated with a single IV infusion . Of the 15patients who started 
the study, all finished the study .  
When the study ended in April 2019, the Sponsor began reviewing the information 
collected.  The Sponsor then created a report of the results. This is a summary of that 
report.
WHAT WERE THE RESULTS OF THE STUDY?
How  much of the standard FIX treatment was absorbed 
following treatment with fidanacogene elaparvovec ?
Treatment with fidanacogene elaparvovec did not change the rate at which normal 
FIX treatment is absorbed .  
Didtreatment with fidanacogene elaparvovec have an effect 
on FIX activity in the body ?
During this study , the average FIX activity levels in patients treated with fidanacogene 
elaparvov ecwas 23%.
Didtreatment with fidanacogene elaparvovec have an effect 
on the number of bleeding events for participants ?
None of the patients had a traumatic blee d during this study .  The average n umber of 
bleeding events experienced by the patients, reduced during the 52 weeks in the study, 
after treatment with fidanacogene elaparvovec .  The average bleeding rate for patients 
treated with fidanacogene elaparvovec, was < 1.  The amount of bleeding ev ents the 
patients experienced after fidanacogene elaparvovec treatment, is shown below.

5This does not mean that everyone in this study had these results.  Other studies may 
produce different results , as well .  These are just some of the main findings of the 
study, and more information may be available at the websites listed at the end of this 
summary.   
WHAT MEDICAL PROBLEMS DID 
PARTICIPANTS HAVE DURING THE STUDY?
The researchers recorded any medical problems the participants had during the study.
Participants could have had medical problems for reasons not related to the study (for 
example, caused by an underlying disease or by chance). Or, medical problems could 
also have been caused by a study treatment or by another medicine the participant wa s

6taking. Sometimes the cause of a medical problem is unknown. By comparing 
medical problems across many treatment groups in many studies, doctors try to 
understand what the side effects of an experimental drug might be.
Fourteen (14) out of 15patients (93%) in this study had at least 1 medical problem
and there were 81 medical problems reported to the study doctors .  Nopatient left 
the study because of medical problems.  The most common medical problems are 
listed in the table below.
Most Common Medica l Problems

(15Patients Treated)
Nose and throat infection 5 (33%)
Common cold 3(20%)
Back pain 3(20%)
Stretched or torn muscle (muscle 
strain)3(20%)
No patient had severe medical problems . Of the 81 medical problems, 53 were mild 
and 28 were considered moderate .
There were 2out of 15patients ( 13%) who had medical problems that the doctors 
thought were related to fidanacogene elaparvovec .  Both of th etreatment -related 
medical problems that were seen were moderate transaminase elevation , which refers 
to having high levels of certain liver enzymes, called transaminase s, suggesting some 
inflammation or irritation of the liver .
During the study, patients had blood samples taken for testing.  Medical problems 
identified in these blood tests are described below.

7Most of the patients remained generally normal for most laboratory blood tests during 
the study.  One (1) patient exper ienced 1 moderate medical problem of normocytic 
anemia (normal -sized red blood cells, but have a low number of them inthe body )
and 1 patient experienced mild medical problem of microcytic an emia (body has fewer 
red blood cells than normal andthe red blo od cells it does have are too small ).  Both 
medical problems were considered not related to study drug by the study doctor .
The study doctors did not note any important or study drug -related results in vital 
signs.  There were no physical examination chang es after study drug infusion that 
were important or related to the study drug.
This does not mean that everyone in this study had these results.  Other studies may 
produce different results, as well.  These are just some of the main findings of the 
study, and more information may be available at the websites listed at the end of this 
summary.
WERE THERE ANY SERIOUS MEDICAL 
PROBLEMS?
A medical problem is considered “serious” when it is life -threatening, needs hospital 
care, or causes lasting problems.  
No patient had serious medical problems and no patients died during the study.
