Why was this study done?
What is COVID -19?
A new respiratory disease appeared in Wuhan, China in December 2019 and has since 
rapidly spread to many other countries around the world.  In January 2020, the cause 
of this disease was found to be a new Coronavirus; and the disease it causes was 
named COVID -19 (Coronavirus disease 2019).  Since then, many companies around 
the world have quickly started to look for ways to prevent COVID -19 disease . 
People can get COVID -19 through contact with another pers on who has the virus. 
COVID -19 is mainly a disease of the respiratory system, but it can also affect other 
organs in the body.  COVID -19 can cause a wide range of symptoms, such as fever, 
cough, shortness of breath, and loss of sense of taste or smell.  CO VID-19 symptoms 
can sometimes be severe .
What are BNT162b2 RNA -Based COVID -19 Vaccines? 
A vaccine is used to help the body to fight off germs. After a vaccine is injected into a 
person’s body, the body responds by making “antibodies”, which are proteins t hat 
fight infections and help to prevent disease .  This is known as the body’s “immune 
response”.
The BNT162b2 investigational vaccine does not contain the whole virus, or the
parts of the virus that can cause COVID -19. Instead, BNT162b2 is made up of part 
of the virus’s genetic code, surrounded by fatty particles called lipids. It uses the 
body’s own cells to produce a “spike protein”. This spike protein may help the body 
to produce antibodies to fight against COVID -19. 
At the time of this study, BNT162b2 was an investigational vaccine and it was not 
approved for general use. BNT162b2 has now been approved for use in many 
countries worldwide .  BNT162b2 is given as 2 doses, about 3 weeks apart.

What was the purpose of this study?
The main purpose of this study was to learn about the safety and about the body’s 
immune response to 4 different batches, or “lots”, of the BNT162b2 vaccine, given at 
2 different doses.  Three of the lots of were intended for use in the United States (US 
lot), and 1lot was intended for use in the European Union (EU lot).  All 4 lots 
contained the same components and were made in the same way.  The researchers 
needed to compare the investigational vaccines from the different lots and doses to be 
sure that they worked the same way and were safe to use . 
Researchers wanted to know: 
Did participants who received vaccines from the 3 US lots have 
similar immune responses? 
Did participants who received a low -dose vaccine have similar 
immune responses to participants who received a standard -dose 
vaccine from the same lot? 
*Results for this study question will be available at a later date.
Did participants who received vaccin es from the EU lot have 
similar immune responses to participants who received vaccines 
from the US lots? 
*Results for this study question will be available at a later date.
How many participants had pain, redness, or swelling at the 
injection site within 7 days after vaccination? 
How many participants had fever, tiredness, headache, chills, 
vomiting, diarrhea, muscle pain, or joint pain within 7 days after 
vaccination?

How many participants had any medical problems within 1 month 
after their second vacci nation?
How many participants had serious medical problems within 
1month after their second vaccination? 
The researchers also studied a third (“booster ”) dose , given about 3 months after 
Dose 2.  The main purpose of this part of the study was to learn a bout the safety and 
about the body’s immune response to the booster dose.
Researchers wanted to know:
Did participants have an immune response to the booster dose?
*Results for this study question will be available at a later date.
How many participants had pain, redness, or swelling at the 
injection site within 7 days after the booster dose?
How many participants had fever, tiredness, headache, chills, 
vomiting, diarrhea, muscle pain, or joint pain within 7 days after the 
booster dose?
How many participants had any medical problems within 1 month 
after the booster dose?

What happened during the study? 
How was the study done?
Part 1
In the first part of t he study, researchers studied 5 groups of study participants.  Each 
group received 2 doses of the BNT162b2 vaccine, given about 3 weeks apart :  
Group 1 (351 participants): US lot 1, standard dose
Group 2 (352 participants): US lot 2, standard dose
Group 3 (347 participants): US lot 3, standard dose
Group 4(173 participants): EU lot, standard dose
Group 5: (351 participants): US lot 1, low dose
This was as an “observer blinded” study, which means that the researchers and the 
participants did not know which lot or dose they received, but the healthcare workers 
who prepared and administered the study vaccines did know. Study participants were 
assigned to each group by chance alone.
Participants were first screened by a doctor to make sure they met the requirements to 
join the study.  This was known as the screening period.  Participants were in Part 1
for about 2 months, and were expected to attend 3 visits at the study center during 
this time.  At these visits, participants received study vaccines, had their blood drawn
and other lab samples collected , and were monitored for any medical problems.
The figure below shows what happened during Part 1.

Part 2 (Booster Study)
In the booster study, researchers studied 2 groups of study participants who had 
previously received 2 standard doses of BNT162b2 (US lot) during the first part of 
the study .  Each group received 1 booster dose of either BNT162b2 o r 
BNT162b2 beta, given about 3 months after they received the second dose in the first 
part of the study.   BNT162b2 beta is a slightly modified version of BNT162b2, made 
to help provide protection against a variant of COVID -19 from South Africa. 
Booster Group 1 (31 participants): BNT162b2 
Booster Group 2 (31 participants): BNT162b2 beta
This was as an “observer blinded” study, which means that the researchers and 
participants did not know which booster they received, but the healthcare workers 
who prepa red and administered the study vaccines did know.  Study participants were 
assigned to each group by chance alone.
Participants were in the booster study for about 1 month, and were expected to attend 
3 visits at the study center during this time.  At thes e visits, participants received study 
vaccines, had their blood drawn and other lab samples collected , and were monitored 
for any medical problems.
The figure below shows what happened during the booster study.

Where did this study take place? 
The Sponsor ran the first part of the study at 16 locations in the United States, and 
the booster study at 8 of these 16 locations.
When did this study take place?
It began 15 February 2021 and ended 22 July 2021 .
Who participated in this study?
Participants 1 2 to 50 years of age could join Part 1 , and participants 18 to 50 years of 
agecould join the booster study .  Study participants:
Were examined by the study doctor and determined to be appropriate for study 
participation
Had never been diagnosed with COVID -19
Had never received a COVID -19 vaccine outside of this study
Were not allergic to any of the ingredients in the study vaccines
Were not pregnant or breast -feeding
A total of 815 men (52%) participated in Part 1
A total of 758 women (48%) participated in Part 1

All participants in Part 1 were 12 to 50 years of age
A total of 31 men (50%) participated in the booster study
A total of 31 women (50%) participated in the booster study
All participants in the booster study were 19 to 50 years of age
A total of 1574 participants joined Part 1 , and 1573 participants (more than 99%) 
received at least 1 study vaccine.  1570 participants (more than 99%) received both 
doses.  16 participants (1%) left the study early, and 2 participants (less than 1%) did 
not receive the second dose due to a medical problem or pregnancy, but remained in 
the study. 1557 participants (99%) completed the study.
A total of 62 participants joined the booster study and received the booster vaccine.  
All 62 participants (100%) completed the b ooster study.
How long did the study last?
Study participants were in Part 1 for about 2 months and the booster study for an 
additional 1 month.  The entire study took about 5 months to complete.  
When the study ended in July 2021, the Sponsor began revie wing the information 
collected.  The Sponsor then created a first report of the results.  This is a summary of 
that report.
What were the results of Part 1 of the study?
Did participants who received vaccines from the 3 US lots have 
similar immune responses?
The researchers measured the amount of antibodies in participants’ blood 1 month 
after the second dose of BNT162b2 . The researchers found that antibody levels in 
participants from Groups 1, 2, and 3 (standard -dose BNT162b2 Lots 1, 2, and 3 ) 
were within a range considered to be comparable to each other. Therefore, the 
090177e1996b0e4c\Approved\Approved On: 22-Feb-2022 06:52 (GMT)
participants who received vaccines from the 3 US lots had similar immune 
responses.  Based on these results, the researchers have decided that the results are 
not likely the result of chance. 
This does not mean that everyone in this study had these results.  This is a summary 
of just some of the main results of this study.  Other studies may have different 
results.
Did participants who received a low -dose vaccine have similar 
immu ne responses to participants who received a standard -dose 
vaccine from the same lot?
Results for this study question are still being reviewed, and will be available at a later 
date.
Did participants who received vaccines from the EU lot have 
similar immune responses to participants who received vaccines 
from the US lots?
Results for this study question are still being reviewed, and will be available at a later 
date.
What were the results of the booster study?
Did participants have an immune response to the booster dose?
Results for this study question are still being reviewed, and will be available at a later

What medical problems did participants have during 
Part 1 of the study?
The researchers recorded any medical problems the participants had during the study.  
Participants could have had medical problems for reasons not related to the study (for 
example, caused by an underlying disease or by chance).  Or, medical problems could 
also have been caused by a study vaccine or by another medicine th e participant was 
taking.  Sometimes the cause of a medical problem is unknown.  By comparing 
medical problems across many vaccine groups in many studies, doctors try to 
understand what effects a study vaccine might have on a participant.
How many participants had pain, redness, or swelling at the 
injection site within 7 days after vaccination?
A total of 1412 out of 1573 participants (90%) had redness, swelling, or pain at the 
injection site within 7 days after receiving either dose of BNT162b2 .  These were 
mostly mild to moderate, and were already known to be side effects of BNT162b2.  
The percentage of participants with redness, swelling, or pain at the injection site was 
similar across each vaccine group, and similar after Dose 1 and Dose 2.  Pai n at the 
injection site was the most common of these medical problems.
How many participants had fever, tiredness, headache, chills, 
vomiting, diarrhea, muscle pain, or joint pain within 7 days after 
vaccination?
A total of 1397 out of 1573 participants (89%) had fever, tiredness, headache, chills, 
vomiting, diarrhea, muscle pain, or joint pain within 7 days after receiving either dose 
of BNT162b2 .  These were mostly mild to moderate, and were already known to be 
side effects of BNT162b2.  The percentage of participants with these medical 
problems was similar across each vaccine group, and these medical problems were 
more common after Dose 2 than Dose 1. Tiredness, headache, and muscle pain were 
the most common of these medical problems.

How many participan ts had any medical problems within 1 month 
after vaccination?
A total of 100 out of 1573 participants (6%) had at least 1 medical problem.  Skin rash 
and swollen lymph nodes were the most common medical problem, occurring in 
7out of 1573 participants (less than 1%) each.  No medical problem happened in at 
least 1% of participants.  One participant (less than 1%) from Group 5 left the study 
because of medical problems that were considered to be related to BNT162b2 (skin 
inflammation and swelling under the s kin), and 1 participant (less than 1%) from 
Group 3 left the study due to pregnancy.  
What medical problems did participants have during 
the booster study?
How many participants had pain, redness, or swelling at the 
injection site within 7 days after the booster dose?
A total of 57 out of 62 participants (92% ) had redness, swelling, or pain at the 
injection site within 7 days after receiving the booster. These were mostly mild to 
moderate, and were already known to be side effects of BNT162b2 and BNT162b2
beta.The percentage of participants with pain, redness, or swelling at the injection 
site was similar in both booster vaccine groups.  Pain at the injection site was the most 
common of these medical problems, and occurred more frequently after the boost er 
dose than after the 2nddose.
How many participants had fever, tiredness, headache, chills, 
vomiting, diarrhea, muscle pain, or joint pain within 7 days after the 
booster dose?
A total of 54 out of 62 participants (87% ) had fever, tiredness, headache, chills, 
vomiting, diarrhea, muscle pain, or joint pain within 7 days after receiving the booster. 
These were mostly mild to moderate, and were already known to be side effects of

BNT162b2 and BNT162b2 beta.  The percentage of p articipants with these medical 
problems was similar in both vaccine groups. These medical problems occurred at a 
similar rate after Dose 2 and the booster dose.  Tiredness, headache, and muscle pain 
were the most common of these medical problems.
How many participants had any medical problems within 1 month 
after the booster dose?
A total of 3 out of 62 participants (5%) had at least 1 medical problem within 
1month after the booster dose.  These medical problems included neck pain, 
abnormal growth of cell s in the abdomen, and swollen lymph nodes .  Swollen lymph 
nodes wasconsidered to be related to the booster .  No participants left the booster 
study because of medical problems.
Did study participants have any serious medical 
problems?
A medical problem is considered “serious” when it is life -threatening, needs hospital 
care, or causes lasting problems.
How many participants had serious medical problems within 
1month after vaccination?  
During the first part of the study, 2 out of 1573 participants (less than 1%) had a 
serious medical problem within 1 month after vaccination: 1 participant from 
Group 4 had a long -lasting migraine headache, and 1 participant from Group 3 
received BNT162b2 while pregnant and had a miscarriage 30 days later.  The study 
doctor did not consider these medical problems to be related to BNT162b2.
How many participants had serious medical problems within 
1month after the booster dose?  
No participants had serious medical problems during the booster study.
