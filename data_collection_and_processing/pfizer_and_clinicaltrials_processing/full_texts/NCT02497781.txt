2WHY WAS THIS STUDY DONE?
A urinary tract infection, or “UTI ”, is the name for an infection in part of the urinary 
system, such as the bladder or urethra.  Children with a UTI may have symptoms such 
as needing to urinate more often, pain when urinating, or blood in the urine.  UTIs 
are usually caused by bacteria, a nd they are usually simple to treat.  However, 
sometimes UTIs can be harder to treat and may require someone to be in the hospital 
to be treated with intravenous (IV) antibiotics. When this happens, it is known as a 
“complicated UTI.”
Ceftazidime -avibacta m (CAZ -AVI) is anantibotic medicine which is used to treat a 
number of infection scaused by certain types of bacteria. CAZ -AVI is currently used 
to treat serious infections, such as complicated UTI, in adults. This study was 
designed to learn more about using CAZ -AVI to treat complicated UTI in children.  
CAZ -AVI has not been approved for use in children, as it is still being studied.  The 
ceftazidime half of CAZ -AVI has previously been approved for use in children.
The main purpose of this study was to learn more about the useof CAZ -AVI in 
children with complicated UTI, compared to another antibiotic medicine called 
cefepime.  The researchers wanted to answer this main question:
For children treated with CAZ -AVI, how well was it tolerated ,and were the re 
any new medical problems different from those that can happen when using
ceftazidime alone ?
In addition, the researchers also wanted to see h ow many children in the study were 
cured or had an improvement in their infection (complicated UTI).
WHAT HAPPEN ED DURING THE STUDY?
This study compared 2 groups of children to learn more about the safety and 
effectiveness of CAZ -AVI, compared to another antibotic medicine called cefepime.  
Cefepime is commonly used to treat complicated UTI in children.
This study w as for children who were diagnosed with complicated UTI .The children 
in this study were at least 3month sold, but younger than 18years oldwhen the y
started the study .

3First, the children were checked by the study doctor to make sure they were a good fit 
for the stu dy.  This was called “screening”.  
The children were grouped by age:
Group 1 (19children) : At least 12 years old, but younger than 18years old 
Group 2 (22children) : At least 6years old, but younger than 12years old
Group 3 (18children) : At least 2years old, but younger than 6years old
Group 4 ( 38children): At least 3 months old, but younger than 2 years old
The children were assigned to receive either CAZ -AVI or cefepime .  Both medicines 
were given into a vein through a small tube and the doses were based on each child’s 
weight.  The children were picked to receive either treatment by chance alone.  
Children receive deither CAZ -AVI or cefepime for at least 3 days .  Depending on 
what the study doctor thought was best for each child, after 3 days of receiving either 
CAZ -AVI or cefepime given into a vein, some children may have switched to an
antibiotic medicine you can take by mouth .  Some children could have receiv edeither 
CAZ -AVI or cefepime intoa vein for up to 14days.
This was a “ single -blind ” study, which means that the children , their
parents/caregivers , their study doctor, pharmacist, and most of the researchers knew 
which medicine they received . However, one study doctor who examined the 
children did not know which medicine they were given.   
Safety was carefully monitored throughout the study.  The s tudy doctors examined 
each child , did blood orurine tests, and watched for any medical problems. The study 
doctors also followed up with the children for 27 to 50 days after the y started study 
treatment.
While children were only in the study for up to 50days (treatment plus follow -up), the 
entire study took about 2years to complete.  Children joined the study at 1 of
25locations in 9countries ( Czech Republic, Greece, Hungary, Poland, Romania, 
Russian Federation, Taiwan, Turkey, and United States). The first child joined the 
study on 24September 2015 and the last child finished the study on 15 September 
2017.  A total of 77girls and 18boys joined the study .

4Children could receive study treatment for a total of 7 to 14 days,and come to a visit 
8to 15 days after the last day they got the study treatment.  The children could come 
to a follow -up visit 27 to 50 days after the first day they got the study treatment.  Of 
the 97children who started the study, 90children (93%) completed it , including 
coming back for the last visit .  A total of 7 children (7%) did not finish the st udy by 
parent/guardian choice ,or because a doctor decided it was best for the child not to 
continue in the study .  
The figure below shows what happened during the study.
When the study ended in September 2017, the Sponsor review edthe information 
collected.  The Sponsor then created a report of the results.  This is a summary of that 
report.

5WHAT WERE THE RESULTS OF THE STUDY?
How  many children in this study were cured or had an 
improvement in complicated UTI? 
To answer this quest ion, the researchers looked at how many children with a certain 
type of bacteria in their urine had improved or resolved symptoms of infectio n.  This 
included 54 children in the CAZ -AVI group and 23 children in the cefepime group. 
They also looked at sampl es of the children’s urine, to find out if bacteria present in 
the urine before treatment would no longer be present after treatment .8to 15 days 
after t hey last got study treatment, 39out of 54 children ( 72%) in the CAZ -AVI 
group were cured or had a n improvement in complicated UTI , and had no bacteria 
present in urine .  14out of 23 children ( 61%) in the cefepime group were cured or 
had an improvement in complicated UTI, and had no bacteria present in urine .
It is important to know that there were not enough children enrolled in the study to 
make any conclusions about the effectiveness of CAZ -AVI compared to cefepime .  
This does not mean that everyone in this study had these results.  Other studies may 
produc e different results, as well.  These are just some of the main findings of the 
study, and more information may be available at the websites listed at the end of this 
summary.  
WHAT MEDICAL PROBLEMS DID CHILDREN 
HAVE DURING THE STUDY?
The researchers recor ded any medical problems the children hadduring the study. 
Children could have had medical problems for reasons not related to the study (for 
example, caused by their disease or by chance). Or, medical problems could have 
been caused by a study procedur e, or by another medicine the child was taking. 
Sometimes the cause of a medical problem is unknown. By comparing medical 
problems across many treatment groups in many studies, doctors try to understand 
what the side effects of an experimental drug might be.

6A total of 97children started the study , but 2 children (1 child in the CAZ -AVI group 
and 1 child in the cefepime group) left the study before receiving treatment. So, there 
were 95 children who received study treatment.   To learn more about the saf ety of 
CAZ -AVI, the researchers looked at the medical problems that happened in these 
95children.  In this study , 51children (54%)had at least 1 medical problem , including 
36 out of 67 children (54%) in the CAZ -AVI group and 1 5out of 28 children (5 4%) 
in the cefepime group.
The most common medical problems reported in children in this study are listed

WERE THERE ANY SERIOUS MEDICAL 
PROBLEMS?
A medical problem is considered “serious” when it is life -threatening, needs hospital 
care, or causes lasting problems.  
10children ( 11%)of the 95 who had study medicine had a serious medical problem . 
This included 8 children (12%) in the CA Z-AVI group and 2 children (7%) in the 
cefepime group.  No children died during the study. 
Overall, the medical problems reported in this study are similar to the medical 
problems reported in past studies with adults. No new issues related to the safety of 
CAZ -AVI were fo und.
