1CLINICAL TRIAL RESULTS
This summary reports the results of only one study.  Researchers must look at the 
results of many types of studies to understand if a study medicine works, how it 
works, and if it is safe to prescribe to patients.  The results of this study might be 
differ ent than the results of other studies that the researchers review.

2WHY WAS THIS STUDY DONE?
Prostate cancer is the name for ca ncer that starts in the prostate, which is a small, 
walnut -sized gland that lies at the base of the bladder in men and is part of the male 
reproductive system.
Enzalutamide is a prescription medicine that is approved to treat men with prostate 
cancer that no longer responds to a medical or surgical treatment that lowers 
testosterone .  Enzalutamide work sby interfering with the connections between 
androgens (a type of hormone that plays a role in male traits and reproductivity ) and 
androgen receptors (a protein in the body that attaches to androgens).  This may help 
to slow the growth of prostate cancer.
The main goal of this study was to learn more about the use of enzalutami de in 
patients with prosta te cancer that was spreading to other parts of the body, despite 
receiving chemotherapy and treatment to block androgens. Chemotherapy is a type 
of medicine used to destroy cancer cells. Researchers wanted to answer th is researc h 
question:
How long did patients survive after receiving enzalutamide ,compared to 
placebo ?
WHAT HAPPENED DURING THE STUDY?
This study compared 2 groups of patients to find out how long patients would survive
after receiving enzalutamide ,compared to plac ebo.  A placebo does not have any 
active medicine in it, but looks just like the medicine. The study included patients who 
had prostate cancer that was spreading to other parts of the body, despite receiving 
1or 2 prior chemotherapy regimens, including at least 1 regimen with a chemotherapy 
medicine called docetaxel.  These patients were also receiving treatment to block 
androgens.  
Patients in this study were assigned to receive either enzalutamide or placebo.  The 
patients and researchers did not know who took enzalutamide and who took the 
placebo.  This is known as a “blinded” study.  Patients were assigned to each 
treatment group by chance alone.  This is known as a “randomized” study.  Putting

3people into groups by chance helps make the groups more similar so they can be 
compared. 
First, patients were checked by a study doctor to make sure they met the requirements 
to join the study.  This was called the screening period.
During the treatment period, patients received the following treatments:
Grou p 1: 8 00patients received enzalutamide at a dose of 160 milligrams, taken 
by mouth each day
Group 2: 399patients received placebo, taken by mouth each day
During the treatment period, p atients came to study visits every 4 weeks for the first 
49 weeks, then every 12 weeks thereafter.   At the study visits, imaging tests were done 
and patients were checked by study doctors to determine if p rostate cancer was 
getting worse (known as prostate cancer “progression”) .  Patients were also asked 
about any medical problems they were having.
Patients came to a follow -up visit 30days after their last dose of enzalutamide or 
placebo (after prostate cancer progression ).Next, patients who were receiving 
placebo had the option to enter the “open -label extension” part of the study.   During 
this part of the study, all patients received enzalutamide and were followed -up every 
12 weeks.   “Open -label” means that the patients and researchers knew which 
medicine the patients were taking.
The figure on the following page shows what happened during this study.

4The amount of time that patients were in the study varied , but the entire study took
more than 8 years to complete , including both the main part of the study and the 
open -label extension part of the study .  The spon sor ran this study at 156locations in 
15countries in Africa, Australia, Europe, North America , and South America .It 
began 30September 20 09and ended 02November 2017.  1,199men joined the study 
and received study treatment .  All patients were between the ages of 41and 9 2years . 
Patients were to continue receiving study treatment until it was confirmed that their 
prostate cancer had gotten worse, and they were scheduled to begin taking another 
treatment for prostate cancer .Of the 1,199patients who started the study,
250patients (2 1%) were still receiving study treatment when the main part of the 
090177e193431851\Approved\Approved On: 17-Apr-2020 08:09 (GMT)
5study ended in September 201 1.  949patients (7 9%) stopped taking study treatment 
by their choice , because a doctor decided it was best for a patient to stop the study , 
because they had a medical problem, because prostate cancer got worse ,or because 
they passed away .  A total of 109 patients from the enzalutamide group and
50patients from the placebo group entered the open -label extension part of the stu dy.
When the study ended in November 2017 , the Sponsor began reviewing the
infor mation collected.  The Sponsor then cr eated a report of the results. This is a 
summary of that report.
WHAT WERE THE RESULTS OF THE STUDY?
How  long did patients survive after receiving enzalutamide ,
compared to placebo ?
To answer this question, the researchers looked at data gathered from the beginning 
of the study until the main part of the study ended in September 2011.  They looked 
at the median length of time that p atients survived after receiving enzalutamide.  A 
“median” is the middle number in a group of numbers. So, researchers looked at the 
length of time that each patient survived, in order from highest to lowest.  The 
median is the middle number, and patients would have the same chance of surviving a 
longer time or a shorter time than this number.
During this time, the median length of time that patients survived after receiving 
enzalutamide was 18.4 months, while the median length of time that patient s survived 
after receiving placebo was13.6months . 
The researchers have de termined that these results are clinically meaningful, and not 
likely based o n chance.  The figure on the following page shows th esestudy result s.

6This does not mean that everyone in this study had these results . Other studies may 
produce different results , as well .  These are just some of the main findings of the 
study, and more information may be available at the websites listed at the end of this 
summary.  
WHAT MEDICAL PROBLEMS DID PATIENTS
HAVE DURING THE STUDY ?
The researchers recorded any medical problems the participant shad during the study. 
Participant s could have had medical problems for reasons not related to the study (for 
example, caused by an unde rlying disease or by chance). Or, medical problems could 
also have been caused by a study treatment, or by another medicine the participan t
was taking. Sometimes the cause of a medical problem is unknown. By comparing 
medical problems across many treatm ent groups in many studies, doctors try to 
understand what the side effects of an experimental drug might be.
1,179out of 1,199patients (9 8%) had at least 1 medical problem .A total of
222patients (19%) stopped taking study treatment because of medical problems.  Out 
of the 50 patient swho took placebo during the main part of the study and switched to 
enzalutamide during the open -label extension part of the study, 48 patients (96%) had

because of medical problems.  The most common medical problems are listed below.

WERE THERE ANY SERIOUS MEDICAL 
PROBLEMS?
A medical problem is considered “serious” when it is life -threatening, needs hospital 
care, or causes lasting problems .  
During the main part of the study, 474 out of 1,199 patients ( 40%) had serious 
medical problems , including 319patients (4 0%) in the enzalutamide group, and 
155patients (39%) in the placebo group .  Out of the 50 patients who took placebo 
during the main part of the study and switched to enzalutamide during the open -label
extension part of the study, 25 patients (50%) had serious medical problems after 
switching .
899patients (75%) died during the main part of the study.  Out of the 50 patients 
who took placebo during the main part of the study and switched to enzalutamide
during the open -label extension part of the study, 21 patients (42 %) died after 
switching .  Most of these deaths were due to prostate cancer progression .
