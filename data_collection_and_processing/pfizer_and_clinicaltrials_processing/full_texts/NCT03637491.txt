Why was this study done?
What is advanced cancer?
This study looked at participants with different types of advanced cancer, including 
metastatic pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma ( mPDAC). Pancreatic ductal 
adenocarcinoma is the most common type of pancreatic cancer. The pancreas is an 
organ located near the stomach that plays a role in the breakdown of food and helps 
to regulate blood sugar levels. Cancer occurs when cells in the body div ide without 
control , sometimes these cells form masses called “tumours”. Cancer is called 
“metastatic” when it spread sto other parts of the body. Metastatic c ancer is extremely 
difficult to be cured or controlled with treatment.
What are avelumab, binime tinib, and talazoparib?
Avelumab, binimetinib, and talazoparib are all medications made to help patients fight 
cancer in different ways.  All three medications have been approved in the U nited 
States and Europe for treating different types of cancer.  Avel umab is an intravenous 
(IV) cancer treatment, received at a clinic.  Binimetinib and talazoparib are both taken 
by mouth.  Researchers think that using combinations of these medications may help 
stop cancers from growing.
What was the purpose of this study?
The purpose of this study was to learn if combinations of avelumab, binimetinib, and 
talazoparib were safe for study participant s with advanced cancer.  All three drugs 
together had never been given before as a combination treatment.  If the medicat ions 
were safe, the researchers would then ask if participants with advanced cancer taking 
only 2 of the study medications or participants taking all 3 study medications saw their 
cancer get better.

Researchers wanted to know:
Was there a combination of doses of avelumab and
binimetinib or binimetinib and talazoparib that could be 
given safely for more studies in the future?
What happened during the study? 
How was the study done?
This study had 2 phases: a dose -finding and anti-tumour phase.  The dose -finding 
phase also had two parts: different dose combinations of two pairs of the medications 
and different dose combinations of all 3 medications.
The combinations o f medications for each of the parts of the study were:
Dose -finding phase:
o2medications
800mg avelumab (1 time every other week)
and 45mg binimetinib (2 times every day , every other week )
800mg avelumab (1 time every other week) 
and30mg binimetinib (2 times every day ,every other week )
45mg binimetinib (2 times every day , every other week )
and 0.75 mg talazoparib (1 time every day , every other week )
30mg binimetinib (2 times every day , every other week ) 
and 0.75 mg talazoparib (1 time every day, every other week)
o3medications (planned, but not done)
Anti-tumour phase (plan ned, but not done)
In the dose -finding phase of the study, researchers tested the combination of 
avelumab and binimetinib orthe combination of binimetinib and talazoparib on a 
090177e198ba74f9\Approved\Approved On: 30-Nov-2021 02:39 (GMT)
group of study participants to find out if study participants had medical problems that 
could be the result of taking the medications at the same time. 
It was planned that groups of participants would take avelumab and binimetinib or 
binimetinib and talazoparib. When a safe dose was found, new participants would 
enter the study and take avelumab, binimetinib, and talazoparib together .  However, 
thisstudy was stopped before any participants joined the dose finding part with all 
3drugs taken together. The anti -tumor phase of the study was also not done.
The study participants and researchers knew who took avelumab and binimetinib and 
who took talazoparib and binimetinib.  This is known as an “open label” study.  
The sponsor ended this study during the 2-medication part of the dose -finding phase 
because it was not likely the dose levels the researchers wanted to use would be
reached .

Where did this study take place? 
The Sponsor ran this study at 10 locations in 3 countries in Asia, Europe, and 
North America.
When did this study take place?
It began on 15 August 2018 and ended on 02 February 2021.
Who participated in this study?
The study included participants who were at least 18 years old, had been diagnosed 
with mPDAC that had worsened following prior treatment , had at least 1 tumour that 
could be measured by doctor, and did not have other major health concerns.
A total of 19 men participated
A total of 16 women participated
All participants were between the ages of 42 and 83 years old
Most partic ipants stopped taking the study medications because their disease got 
worse.  All 35 participants stopped being in the study ,mostly because they died, by 
their choice, or they were still in the study when it was ended early by the sponsor .
How long did the study last?
Study participants received study treatment until their cancer got worse , they had 
serious medical problems that did not allow continued treatment with one or both of 
the study drug s,or by their choice .  The entire study ranover 29 months before it was 
ended early by the sponsor .
When the study was ended early by the sponsor in February 2021, the Sponsor began 
reviewing the information collected.  The Sponsor then created a report of the results.  
This is a summary of that r eport.
What were the results of the study?

Was there a combination of doses of avelumab and binimetinib or 
binimetinib and talazoparib that could be given safely for more 
studies in the future?
To learn more about the safety of taking 2 types of medications together, the study 
doctors looked at the number of certain medical problems possibly caused by the 
study drugs during the first 28 days of the study treatment.   The percentage of 
participants who had such medical problem sin each group are sho wn in the graph 
below.   
The sponsor decided to end the study early because giving all 3 drugs at the same time 
did not appear to be p ractical .
This does not mean that everyone in this study had these results.  This is a summary 
of just some of the main results of this study.  Other studies may have different 
results.

What medical problems did participants have during 
the study?
The researchers recorded any medical problems the participants had during the study.  
Participants could have had medical p roblems for reasons not related to the study (for 
example, caused by an underlying disease or by chance).  Or, medical problems could 
also have been caused by a study treatment or by another medicine the participant was 
taking.  Sometimes the cause of a me dical problem is unknown.  By comparing 
medical problems across many treatment groups in many studies, doctors try to 
understand what effects a study medication might have on a participant.
Allof theparticipants in this study had at least 1 medical probl em.  A total of 
3participants stopped allthe study treatment because of medical problems.  The most 
common medical problems –those reported by more than 30% of participants –are 
described below.
Below are instructions on how to read Table 1. 
Instructions for Understanding Table 1. 
The 1stcolumn of Table 1 lists medical problems that were commonly 
reported during the study.  All medical problems reported by more 
than 30% of participants are listed.
The 2ndcolumn tells how many of the 22 participants taking 
binimetinib and avelumab reported each medical problem.  Next to this 
number is the percentage of the 22 participants taking the study 
medication who reported the medical problem. 
The 3rdcolumn tells h ow many of the 13 participants taking 
binimetinib and talazoparib reported each medical problem.  Next to 
this number is the percentage of the 13 participants taking binimetinib 
and talazoparib who reported the medical problem.

Did study participants have any serious medical 
problems?
A medical problem is considered “serious” when it is life -threatening, needs hospital 
care, or causes lasting problems.
