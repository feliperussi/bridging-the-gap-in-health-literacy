2WHY WAS THIS STUDY DONE?
The purpose of this research study was to compare the safety and effectiveness of 
PF-05280586 to currently approved and marketed rituximab for treatment of low 
tumor burden follicular lymphoma (also called LTB -FL).  LTB -FL is a type of non -
Hodgkin’s lymphoma (NHL).  NHL is a type of cancer which starts in your lymphatic 
system (the disease fighting system).  LTB -FL is not as aggressive and has a better 
prognosis (the likely outcome) than other types of NHL.
One of the most common treatments for LTB -FL is with a medication called 
rituximab (also called Rituxan®or MabThera®).  Rituximab is given as a monotherapy 
for LTB -FL.  Monotherapy means one medicine given without other medicines at the 
same time.  Rituximab works by attaching to a protein called CD20.  CD20 sits on the 
surface of B lymphocytes (a type of white blood cell).  When rituximab binds to the 
CD20 protein i t causes the B lymphocytes, including the cancerous ones, to die.  
Rituximab is a biologic medicine.  Biologics can be made up of sugars, proteins, 
genetic material, human or non -human cells, and tissues (or groups of cells).  
Rituximab is a good first -line treatment option for LTB -FL as per treatment 
guidelines like the National Comprehension Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines.
PF-05280586 is another biologic medicine.  PF -05280586 was made to be like 
Rituxan®or MabThera®.  It was designed to have a simila r structure and work in the 
same way that Rituxan®or MabThera®do.  This type of medicine is known as a 
biosimilar.  PF -05280586 was the investigational medicine in this study.  An 
investigational medicine is one that is not approved for sale in any count ry.  
The table on the next page shows the differences between rituximab (the “biologic”) 
and PF -05280586, (the medicine tested to see if it was a “biosimilar” to rituximab) in 
this study.

4There were other criteria patients had to have to be a part of the study in addition to 
the ones listed above.  These were just some of the main criteria patients had to hav e. 
This study compared 2 groups of patients.  One group was treated with PF -05280586.  
The other group was treated with rituximab.
The patients and researchers did not know who took PF -05280586 and who took 
rituximab.  This is known as a “blinded” study. This was done to make sure the trial 
results were not influenced in any way.  
Patients were put into 1 of 2 treatment groups by chance alone.  This is known as a 
“randomized” study.  This is done to make the groups more similar, which makes 
comparing the groups more fair. 
The figure below shows a summary of what happened during the study.
While patients were in the study for a year, the entire study took about 3 ½ years to 
complete.  Patients joined the study at 1 of 160 locations in 29 countries in Eu rope, 
Asia, North America, and South America.  It began 30 September 2014 and ended 
19April 2018.  178 men and 216 women participated.  All patients were between the 
ages of 21 and 93 years old.

5Patients were supposed to be treated until they got 4 weekly treatments with either 
PF-05280586 or rituximab.  Of the 394 patients who started the study, 393 patients 
got at least 1 dose of either study medicine.  1 patient left the study before getting any 
study medicine.  390 patients finished the 4 weekly cycles of study medicine.  
340patients completed the entire study.  This means that they completed all of the 
visits in the study including the Week 52 visit.  54 patients did not finish the Week 52 
visit.  They left before the study was over by their choice, o r a doctor decided it was 
best for a patient to stop the study.
When the study ended in April 2018, the Sponsor began reviewing the information 
collected.  The Sponsor then created a report of the results. This is a summary of that 
report.

6WHAT WERE THE RESULTS OF THE STUDY?
Was PF -05280586 as effective as rituximab?
Researchers wanted to compare whether PF -05280586 was as effective as rituximab 
for patients with LTB -FL.  In this study, patients received either PF -05280586 or 
rituximab in an infusion onc e per week for 4 weeks.  Patients were checked to see if 
they had a complete response or a partial response to the treatment.  A complete 
response is when there is no evidence of cancer after treatment.  A partial response is 
when the cancer has improved a fter treatment.  At the Week 26 visit, 148 patients 
(76%, or 148 of 196 patients) who were in the PF -05280586 group had a complete or 
partial response to treatment.  140 patients (71%, or 140 of 198 patients) who were in 
the rituximab group had a complete or partial response to treatment at the 
Week 26visit.  The amount of patients who had a complete or partial response at 
Week 26 was comparable between the 2 groups.  
Based on these results, the researchers have concluded that the results are not likely 
the result of chance.

7Was the safety of taking PF -05280586 comparable to 
rituximab?
Patients were given a variety of different tests, such as physical exams by doctors, 
ECGs (a test to see how well your heart is working), collection of information (such 
as medical problems the patient was experiencing during the study), vital signs, and 
blood and urine tests (see below picture).  Based on the data collected from these 
tests, getting infusions of PF -05280586 once per week for 4 weeks had comparable 
safety to rituximab for patients with LTB -FL. 
This does not mean that everyone in this study had these results.  Other studies may 
produce different results, as well.  These are just some of the main findings of the 
study, and more information may be available at the websites listed at the end of this 
summary.

8WHAT MEDICAL PROBLEMS DID PATIENTS 
HAVE DURING THE STUDY?
The researchers recorded any medical problems the participants had during the study.  
Participants could have had medical problems for reasons not related to the study (for 
example, caused by an underlying disease or by chance).  Or, medical problems could
have been caused by a study treatment, or by another medicine the participant was 
taking.  Sometimes the cause of a medical problem is unknown.  By comparing 
medical problems across many treatment groups in many studies, doctors try to 
understand what the side effects of an experimental drug might be.
190 out of 393 patients who received at least one dose of study medicine (either 
PF-05280586, or rituximab) in this study had at least 1 non-serious medical problem.  
A non -serious medical problem means that it is not life -threatening, does not cause 
lasting problems, or does not need hospital care.  97 patients (49%, or 97 out of 
197patients) in the rituximab treatment group had at least 1 non -serious medical 
problem.  93 patients (47%, or 93 out of 196 patients) in the PF -5280586 treatment 
group had at least 1 non-serious medical problem.  
Between the 2 treatment groups, the medical problems were comparable in type and 
how often they occurred.  They were also comparable to the known medical problems 
which c an be caused by rituximab.  The most common non -serious medical problems 
reported by participants in this study are listed on the next page.

WERE THERE ANY SERIOUS MEDICAL 
PROBLEMS?
A medical problem is considered “serious” when it is either life -threatening or causes 
death, causes lasting problems, is considered medically important by the study doctor, 
or needs hospital care.  
32patients (8%, or 32 out of 393 patients) had serious medical problems.  A total of 
15patients in the rituximab group had a serious medical problem.  17 patients in the 
PF-05280586 group had a serious medical problem.  The most common serious 
medical problem experienced in both treatment groups was infection .  4patients (2%, 
or 4 out of 196 patients) in the PF -05280586 group and 3 patients (2%, or 3 out of 
197patients) had an infection.

102patients died during the study because their cancer got worse (known as disease 
progression).  1 patient was in the PF -05280586 group and 1 patient was in the 
rituximab group.  Both deaths occurred more than 4 weeks after the study ended.  
The deaths were considered by researchers to not be related to study treatment.
