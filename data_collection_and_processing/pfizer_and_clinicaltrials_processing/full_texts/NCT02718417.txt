2WHY WAS THIS STUDY DO NE?
Ovarian cancer is the name for cancer that originates in the ovar y, which isthe female 
reproductive organ that produce seggs and sex hormones .  Ovarian cancer is a major 
cause of cancer death in women.  Epithelial ovarian cancer is the most common typ e 
of ovarian cancer, and it originates in the cells that cover the outer surface of the 
ovary.
Researchers are looking for treatments for ovarian cancer.  Avelumab is a medicine 
that may work by targeting a protein called “Programmed Death -Ligand 1” (PD-L1) 
found on the cancer cell .  PD -L1 is involved in the body’s immune system response 
to cancer.
When this study was started, avelumab was being tested for use in women with 
advanced ovarian cancer.  A lthough avelumab is approved in other types of cancer, it 
is not approved for use in ovarian cancer.
For women with newly d iagnosed advanced ovarian cancer, the standard treatment 
includes a combination of chemotherapy and surgery. Chemotherapy is often used 
after surgery to kill any cancer cells that might remain. It can also be used before 
surgery.   This approach is usually effective, but in many cases the cancer comes back .  
The main goal of this study was to determine if adding a new drug (avelumab )both 
during and/orafter standard chemotherapy treatment would increase the amount of 
time it takes for ovarian cancer to worsen (progress ).The study also evaluated the 
overall safety of avelumab alone or in combination with standard chemotherapy.
WHAT HAPPENED DURING THE STUDY?
This study included 3 groups of patients taking platinum -based chemotherapy with no 
maintenance treatment, platinum -based chemotherapy followed by avelumab 
maintenance treatment, or platinum -based chemotherapy given together with 
avelumab then followed by avelumab maintenance treatment. Maintenance treatment
means a treatment that is given to stop cancer from coming back after it has 
disappeared following an initial t reatment .

3The study included adult women with advanced epithelial ovarian cancer that had 
spread beyond the pelvis or throughout the body who had not yet received treatment 
for their advanced cancer.   Patients in this study must have had a surgery to remove as 
much cancer as possible .  This was an “open -label” st udy, which means that both the 
patients and researchers knew which medicines were being given.
Potential p atients were evaluated by the study doctor to make sure they met the 
criteria to participate in the study.   This was known as the “screening period”, which 
lasted up to 28 days.  Next, eligible patients were assigned to 1 of 3 treatment groups:
Group A (335 patients): Platinum -based chemotherapy with no maintenance 
treatment
Group B (332 patients): Platinum -based chemotherapy followed by avelumab 
mainte nance treatment
Group C (331 patients): Platinum -based chemotherapy given together with 
avelumab, then followed by avelumab maintenance treatment
Patients were assigned to each group by chance.  Putting people into groups by 
chance is called randomization.   This helps make it more likely that the groups will be 
more even to compare. 
The chemotherapy combination of medicines used in this study waspaclitaxel and 
carboplatin.  All study treatments were given byintravenous (IV)infusion (a needle 
into a vein) .  
During the chemotherapy phase, patients received carboplatin every 3 weeks and 
paclitaxel either every 1 week or every 3 weeks (patient’s doctor allowed to choose) .  
Patients in Group Calso received avelumab every 3 weeks during the chemotherapy 
phase .  
During the maintenance phase, patients in Groups Band Creceived avelumab every 
2weeks, and patients in Group Areceived observation only (no study treatments)
during this time.
The main goal of this study was to determine if adding a new drug (avelumab) both 
during and /orafter standard chemotherapy treatment would increase the amount of

4time it takes for ovarian cancer to worsen (progress). The study also evaluated the 
overall safety of avelumab alone or in combination with standard chemotherapy.
After the last dose of study treatment, there was a 90-day follow -up period that 
included a monthly safety follow -up.  There was a long -term follow -up period, which 
lasted until patients left the study or the study ended.
The figure below shows what happened during this study.

5The amount of time that patients were in the study varied ,but the entire study lasted 
about 3 years.  The sponsor ran this study at 182 locations in 25 countries in Asia, 
Europe, and North America.  It began on19May 2016.  998 women joined the study, 
and 991 women received study treatment.  Patients in the study were between the ages 
of 26and 8 6.
Patients were expected to complete study treatment and a 90 -day follow -up period, 
then enter the long -term follow -up period.  The tables below show how many 
patients completed study treatment, and how many patients did not complete study 
treatment either by their choice orbecause a doctor decided it was best for a patient 
to stop being in the study .
Chemotherapy Phase
Group A : Out of 335 patients, 279 (83%) completed paclitaxel and 
290patients (87%) completed carboplatin.  56 patients (17%) stopped taking 
paclitaxel early and 45 patients (13%) stopped taking carboplatin early .The 
most common reasons for stopping study treatment were medical problems, 
worsening ovarian cancer, or patient cho ice.
Group B : Out of 332 patients, 275 (83%) completed paclitaxel and 
280patients (84%) completed carboplatin.  57 patients (17%) stopped taking 
paclitaxel early and 52 patients (16%) stopped taking carboplatin early.   The 
most common reasons for stopping study treatment were medical problems, 
worsening cancer, or patient cho ice.
Group C : Out of 331 patients, 284 (86%) completed avelumab, 281 (85%) 
completed paclitaxel, and 290 patients (88%) completed carboplatin.  
47patients (14%) stopped taking avelumab early, 50 patients (15%) stopped 
taking paclitaxel early, and 41 patients (12%) stop ped taking carboplatin early.   
The most common reasons for stopping study treatment were medical 
problems, worsening cancer, or patient cho ice.

6Maintenance Phase
Group A: Out of 335 patients, 114 patients (34%) stopped the observation 
early, and 172 p atients (51%) w erestill under observation at the time of the 
data cutoff .  The most common reasons for stopping the observation were 
medical problems, worsening cancer, or patient choice.
Group B : Out of 332 patients, 112 patients (34%) stopped the maintenance 
therapy early, and 155 patients (47%) were continuing maintenance therapy at 
the time of the data cutoff.   The most common reasons for stopping 
maintenance therapy were medical problems, worsening cancer, or patient 
choice.
Group C : Out of 331 patients, 107 patients (32%) stopped the maintenance 
therapy early, and 180 patients (54%) were continuing maintenance therapy at 
the time of the data cutoff.   The most common reasons for stopping 
maintenance therapy were medical problems, worsening cance r, or patient 
choice.
In September 2018 , the Sponsor began reviewing the information collected.  The 
Sponsor then created a report of the results.  This is a summary of that report. 
WHAT WERE THE RESULTS OF THE STUDY?
Did adding avelumab both during and after standard 
chemotherapy treatment increase the amount of time it takes 
for ovarian cancer to worsen (progress)?
To answer this question, the researchers compared the progression free survival 
(PFS), which is the time patients survived without their can cer getting worse.  A more 
easily understood measure is the median PFS, or the estimated time by which half 
(50%) of the patients would have survived without their cancer getting worse.  It is 
equally likely for a patient to have survived longer than this time without their cancer 
getting worse as it is that they survived less time without their cancer getting worse.

7In this study, the estimated median time of survival (PFS) without cancer getting 
worse for each group was as follows:
Group A (platinum -based chemotherapy with no maintenance treatment): At 
the time that the researchers analyzed the study results, the median time of 
survival without cancer getting worse in this group could not be estimated 
because there were too few patients with worsening cancer to make an accurate 
estimation.
Group B(platinum -based chemotherapy followed by avelumab maintenance 
treatment ): 16.8 months
Group C(platinum -based chemotherapy given together with avelumab, 
followed by avelumab maintenance treatment ): 18.1 months 
The study data was reviewed by an independent Data and Safety Monitoring Board 
(DSMB). DSMBs are used to ensure the safety of study participants and to determine 
if it is appropriate for a study to continue. There were no new or unexpected s afety 
issues identified with avelumab alone, or with the combination of avelumab plus 
paclitaxel and carboplatin. However, the DSMB concluded that there was little to no 
chance that the trial would demonstrate any benefit when adding avelumab to the 
stand ard chemotherapy treatment. The addition of avelumab did not increase the 
amount of time it takes for ovarian cancer to worsen, and consequently the study was 
stopped early to give patients an opportunity to seek other treatments.
This does not mean that everyone in this study had these results.  Other studies may 
produce different results, as well.  These are just some of the main findings of the 
study, and more information may be available at the websites listed at the end of this 
summary.  
WHAT MEDICAL PROBLEMS DID PATIENTS 
HAVE DURING THE STUDY?
The researchers recorded any medical problems the patients had during the study. 
Patients could have had medical problems for reasons not related to the study (for 
example, caused by an underlying disease or by chance).  Or, medical problems could 
also hav e been caused by a study treatment, or by another medicine the patient was 
taking.  Sometimes the cause of a medical problem is unknown.  By comparing

understand what the side ef fects of an experimental drug might be.
In this report, allmedical problems that occurred during the study are discussed , 
regardless of whether or not the study doctors thought that the medical problems 
were related to taking the study treatment.
Of the 9 91 patients who received study treatment, 970 (98%) patients had at least 
1medical problem.  A total of 12 5(13%) patients stopped taking study treatment 
because of medical problems.  The most common medical problems are listed below .
