CLINICAL TRIAL RESULTS
This summary reports the results of only one study.  Researchers must look at the 
results of many types of studies to understand if a study medicine works, how it 
works, and if it is safe to prescribe to patients.  The results of this study might be 
different than the results of other studies that the researchers review.

2WHY WAS THIS STUDY DONE?
Atopic dermatitis (or “AD”), which is also sometimes called atopic eczema, is a 
common skin disorder that causes patches of flaky, red, and very itchy skin.  AD 
occurs in 15% -30% of children in the United States.  Some of the current medicines 
available fo r AD can only be used for short time periods, or can cause other health 
problems.  Researchers are looking for new treatments for AD that can be taken for 
long periods of time. 
While researchers think that many things cause AD, it is made worse by the bod y’s 
immune system (the body’s defense against infection) causing redness and swelling 
(inflammation).  Cells in the immune system cause inflammation by making special 
proteins called “cytokines”.  Researchers think that medicines that lower the amount 
of cytokines that the body makes could help treat patients with AD. 
The drug tested in this study was abrocitinib, which is an experimental drug that has 
not been approved for sale yet.  Abrocitinib blocks the activity of a protein called 
“Janus kinase 1” , or“JAK 1”, which acts like an on/off switch for the cells of the 
immune system.  By turning off this switch, the cells of the immune system are expected 
to produce fewer cytokines ,which may help AD improve .  The researchers wanted to 
ask,
Are patients who are treated with medicated topical therapy more likely 
to have their AD improve when also taking abrocitinib compared to 
patients who are treated with a placebo ? 
“Medicated topical therapy” was cream or ointment applied to the skin that contains 
medicine t hat is approved to treat AD .  To see if the patients’ AD got better during the 
study , the researchers used 2 standard methods to measure the severity of AD at the 
start of the study and throughout the 12 weeks of study treatment.  The difference in 
severity was used to decide if a patient’s AD had improved or not.

3WHAT HAPPENED DURING THE STUDY?
This study compared 3 groups of patients to find out if patients treated with 100 mg 
or 200 mg of abrocit inibonce daily were more likely to have their AD improve 
compared to patients taking a placebo.  A placebo does not have any medicine in it, 
but it looks just like the study medicine. 
The study included adolescent boys and girls who were at least 12 year s oldand up to
18years old .  Patients included in the study:
Had a confirmed diagnosis of moderate to severe AD when they entered the 
study.
Also had one of the following: 
oHad been treated up to 6 months earlier for AD with medicines 
applied to the skin for at least 4 weeks , and their AD did not get better;
oHad n eeded to use medicines that reach all parts of the body to control 
their AD in the last 6 months (for example, taking medicines by 
mouth) , or were eligible to take these medicines .
Had used moist urizing products on their skin (such as skin cream) that did 
not contain medicine at least twice daily for the 7 days before starting the 
study treatments.
Were willing to use standard skin treatments for AD during the study (called 
‘topical background the rapy’) .
Had not taken medications like abrocitinib before ( known as systemic JAK 
inhibitors).
The patients and doctors did not know who took abrocitinib and who took the 
placebo.  This is known as a “double -blinded” study.  This is done to make sure the 
results of the research study cannot be unfairly influenced by anyone .  Patients were 
assigned to 1 of 3 treatment groups by chance (like the flip of a coin or drawing straws) 
to receive either abrocitinib at a dose of 100 mg, abrocitinib at a dose of 200 mg,or 
placebo.  This is known as a “randomized and placebo -controlled ” study.
All of the patients in this study were treated with medicated topical therapy while 
taking abrocitinib or placebo.

4The researchers in this study used 2 different tests to mea sure the severity of the 
patients’ AD at the beginning of the study and throughout 12 weeks of treatment.  
The first test is called the Investigators Global Assessment (IGA) scale and measures 
the severity of AD on a 5 -point scale (0 being the best and 4 b eing the worst).  The 
second test is called the Eczema Area and Severity Index, and measures how severe a 
patient’s AD is based on 4 different signs, as well as the amount of skin affected by 
AD.  The difference in each patient’s score between the start of the study and after 
12weeks of treatment was used to decide if their AD had improved.
While patients were only in the study for 12 to 16 weeks , the entire study took almost 
14months to complete.  The Sponsor ran this study at 99locations in 13countries in
Europe, Asia, Australia, and North America .  It began on18February 2019 and 
ended on08April 2020.  A total of 145 boys and 140 girls participated.  All patients 
were between the ages of 11and 18. 
Patients were to be treated until the en d of the 12 week treatment period .  Of the 
285patients who started the study, 273finished the study .  Five (5 )patients did not 
finish the study because of medical problems. Seven (7) patients left before the study

5was over by their choice or their pare nt’s choice, or because a doctor decided it was 
best for a patient to stop being in the study.
When the study ended in April 2020 , the Sponsor began reviewing the information 
collected.  The Sponsor then created a report of the results.  This is a summary of that 
report.
WHAT WERE THE RESULTS OF THE STUDY?
Were patients who we re treated with medicated topical therapy 
more likely to have their AD improve when also taking abrocitinib 
compared to patients who were treated w ith a placebo ?
Yes.  In this study, more patients in the abrocitinib 100 mg or 200 mg treatment 
groups had their AD improve, compared to the placebo group.  
When the change in severity of AD was measured using the IGA scale, 37 out of 
89patients (42%) in the abrocitini b 100 mg treatment group and 43 out of 93 patients 
(46%) in the abrocitinib 200 mg treatment group had their AD improve to ‘clear’ or 
‘almost clear’ (score of 0 or 1) after 12 weeks.  In comparison, 23 out of 94 patients 
(25%) in the placebo group had thei r AD improve to ‘clear’ or ‘almost clear’ after 
12weeks.  
When the change in severity of AD was measured using the Eczema Area and 
Severity Index, 61 out of 89 patients (69%) in the abrocitinib 100 mg treatment group 
and 67 out of 93 patients (72%) in th e abrocitinib 200 mg treatment group had their 
AD improve by at least 75% after 12 weeks.  In comparison, 39 out of 94 patients 
(42%) in the placebo group had their AD improve by at least 75% after 12 weeks.  
These results are also shown in graphs on the next page.

6Based on these results, the researchers have decided that the results are not likely the 
result of chance.  Abrocitinib may be an option for treating AD in adolescents who 
are 12 to 18 years of age.
This does not mean that everyone in this study had these results.  Other studies may 
produce different results, as well.  These are just some of the main findings of the 
study, and more information may be available at the websites listed at the end of this 
summary.

7WHAT MEDICAL PROBLEMS DID 
PARTICIPANTS HAVE DURING THE STUDY?
The researchers recorded any medical problems the participants had during the study.  
Participants could have had medical problems for reasons not related to the study (for 
example, caused by an underlying disease or by ch ance).  Or, medical problems could 
also have been caused by a study treatment or by another medicine the participant was 
taking.  Sometimes the cause of a medical problem is unknown.  By comparing 
medical problems across many treatment groups in many studi es, doctors try to 
understand what the side effects of an experimental drug might be.
163out of 285patients in this study had at least 1 medical problem.  A total of 
5patients left the study because of medical problems.  The most common medical 
problems are listed below.

WERE THERE ANY SERIOUS MEDICAL 
PROBLEMS?
A medical problem is considered “serious” when it is life -threatening, needs hospital 
care, or causes lasting problems.  
Three (3) patients out of 285 patients (1%) had serious medical problems :2 patients 
who took placebo and 1 patient that took abrocitinib 200 mg.  No patients died 
during the study.
