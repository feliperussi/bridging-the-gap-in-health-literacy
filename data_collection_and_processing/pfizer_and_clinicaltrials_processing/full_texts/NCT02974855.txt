2WHY WAS THIS STUDY DONE?
Hemophilia is a disease that is “inherited”, which means it runs in families ,and it 
mainly affects boys and men.  People with hemophilia have problems with their blood 
not clotting.  After an injury, someone with hemophilia will bruise more easily and ,if 
cut,will bleed for longer.  Sometimes the bleeding can happen inside the body and 
this “internal bleeding” can be serious as it can cause damage.  
Doctors prescribe medicines called “factor replacement therapy ”tohelp the blood to 
clot in people with hemophilia .  These treatments work by replacing the clotting 
factors that are missing from the blood of a person with hemophilia .  Clotting factors 
are proteins in the blood that help stop bleeding after in injury as well as prevent 
bleeding from happening .  There are many different clotting factors in the blood and 
these are numbered using Roman numerals.  People with hemophilia A are missing 
Factor VIII (8) and people with hemophilia B are missing Factor IX (9).  This means 
Factor VIII isgiven in factor replacement therapy to people with hemophilia A and 
Factor IX is given to people with hemophilia B.  Factor replacement therapy is given 
by “infusion ”and t he medicine is prepared in a syringe and then “injected” or p ushed
through a patient’s skin into a“vein”.  A vein is a tube that carries blood around the 
body.   Other treatments are also available that can be given by “injection”, or a shot, 
“subcutaneously ”, to prevent or reduce the number of bleeding episodes (also known 
as bleeds) .  Subcutaneously means the injection is given just underneath the skin.  
Marst acimab ( PF-06741086 )is a new kind of treatment being studied for hemophilia .  
Itworks in a different way to other treatments to help blood to clot.  The treatment is 
given subcutaneously and, o ver time, the medicine is able to reach the bloodstream 
where it may help to prevent or reduce the number of bleeding episodes. 
WHAT HAPPENED DURING THE STUDY?
This study included 4groups of patients given an injection of marstacimab at different 
doses .  This was done to see if patients had an y medical problems after this treatment
and also see if this treatment could prevent bleeding episodes.  The 4 groups and the 
different doses of marstacimab that were given in this study areshown in the 
following table.

aIt was planned that 6patients would be included in Group 1 and while 8 were enrolled only 
7patients were treated with marstacimab as 1 withdrew their consent before receiving treatment .
bPatients with inhibitors to their factor replacement therapy could only join Group 4.
The study included patients who had severe hemophilia A or B ,with or without 
“inhibitors” .  Some patien ts with hemophilia can develop inhibitors in their blood to 
the proteins in factor replacement therapy.  These inhibitors stop the clotting factors 
in the factor replacement therapy from working.  This means that people with 
hemophilia who have these inhibitors may have more severe bleeds and may need 
higher doses of factor replacement therapy or alternative treatment (s)to stop any 
bleeding.  Patients with inhibitors to their factor replacement therapy were only able 
to join Group 4.

4This was an op en-label study, so everyone, including the patient, knew what treatment 
was given to each group.  
While patients were only in the study for 5months, the entire study took 21months 
tocomplete.  The sponsor ran this study at 8locations in 6countries in North 
America, South America, Europe and South Africa .  It began 08March 2017 and 
ended 03Decembe r2018.  27 men participated and 26 were treated with marstacimab

5(1 patient decided he did not want to be treated with marstacimab before being given 
his first injection ).  All patients were between the ages of 19and 63years.
The 7 patients in Group 1 were treated first and were given 1 injection of 
marstacimab each week so that they received 5 injections of marstacimab .  If these 
patients did not have many medical problems after 4weeks , the 6 patients in Group 2 
were treated.  If the 6 patients in Group 2 did not have many medical problems after 
4 weeks , then the 6 patients in Group 3 were treated.  If the 6 patients in Group 3 did 
not have m any medical problems after 4weeks , then the 7patients in Group 4 were 
treated.  
Patients were to be treated once a week for up to 3 months.  Of the 26patient swho 
started the study, 24(92%) finished the study and 2 (8%) did not finish the study
because of medical problems.  
When the study ended in December 2018, the Sponsor began reviewing the 
infor mation collected.  The Sponsor then cr eated a report of the results. This is a 
summary of that report.

6WHAT WERE THE RESULTS OF THE STUDY?
Did patients taking marstacimab have any medical 
problems?
The researchers recorded any medical problems the patient shad during the study. 
Patient s could have had medical problems for reasons not related to the study (for 
example, caused by an underlying disease or by chance). Or, medical problems could 
also have been caused by a study treatment, or by another medicine the patient was 
taking. Sometimes the cause of a medical problem is unknown. By comparing 
medical problems across many treatment groups in many studies, doctors try to 
understand what the side effects of an experimental drug might be.
Overall, 21out of 26patients(81%)in this study had at least 1 medical problem and 
there were 56 medical problems reported to the doctors .A total of 2patients (8%)
left the study because of medical problems.  This included 1patient who had high 
blood pressure and 1 patient who had thelevel of “fibrinogen ”in a blood sample he 
gave that was reduced after treatment .  Fibrinogen is a protein in the blood thatis 
used to make fibrin ,which helps blood to clot.  
The most common medical problems are listed in the following table . 
Most medical problems were not severe (17 out of 21 patients, 81%, had medical 
problems graded as mild or moderate). There were 4 patients who had medical 
problems that were severe and these were injection site pain and swelling (2 patients), 
reduced levels of fibrinogen (1 patient who left the study because of this), and itchy, 
red rash (1 patient).

Pain in the joints 2 (8%)
Headache 2 (8%)
There were 14 out of the 26 patients (54%) who had medical problems that the 
doctors thought were related to marstacimab .  Treatment -related medical problems 
that were seen in 2 or more patients are shown in the following table, with most 
involving the injection site.  Most of the injection site reactions were “mild”.  This 
means there was some tenderness around the site of the injection that got better with 
time and did not need any additional treatment.

been injured)3 (12%)
Prolonged prothrombin time (b lood clots too slowly ) 2 (8%)
Decreased blood fibrinogen (needed for blood clots) 1 (4%)
Doctors measure dthe level of cardiac troponin to see if there has been any damage to 
the heart and 4 patients had abnormal levels.  For 3of these patients , this was also 
recorded as increased cardiac troponin.  Th is was thought by doctors to be related to

9marstacimab in2 of these 3 patients.  The doctors used an “electrocardiogram ”, or 
ECG machine, to look at the activity of the heart during the study.  None of the 
patients had heart problems.  
There were 2 patients who had the medical problem of “prolonged prothrombin 
time” or when the blood clot stoo slowly .The doctor thought that this medical 
problem was related to marstacimab treatment in 1 of these 2patients.
1 patient had their levels of blood fibrinogen , which is needed for blood clots , 
reduced after treatment a nd this was thought by the doctor to be related to 
marstacimab .  This patient left the study because of this.  While o ther patients had 
reduc ed blood fibrinogen in their blood tests, the doctor did not think these 
reductions were medically important. 
1 of the 26patients (4%) had a blood pressure increase that the doctor thought was 
related to marstacimab .  This patient left the study because of this . 
This does not mean that everyone in this study had these results.  Other studies may 
produce different results, as well.  These are just some of the main findings of the 
study, and more information may be available at the websites listed at the end of this 
summary.
Were there any serious medical problems?
A medical problem is consider ed “serious” when it is life -threatening, needs hospital 
care, or causes lasting problems .  
A total of 4 patient s (15%, or 4 out of 26patients ) had serious medical problems .  
None of these serious medical problems were thought by the doctors to be due to 
treatment with marstacimab .  There were no serious medical problems involving 
blood clotting.  No patients died during the study.
