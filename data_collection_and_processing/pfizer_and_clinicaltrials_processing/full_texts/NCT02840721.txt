CLINICAL TRIAL RESULTS
This summary reports the results of only one study.  Researchers must look at the 
results of many types of studies to understand if a study medicine works, how it 
works, and if it is safe to prescribe to patients.  The results of this study might be 
differ ent than the results of other studies that the researchers review.

2WHY WAS THIS STUDY DONE?
Ulcerative Colitis (or “UC”) is a long -term inflammatory medical condition that 
affects the large intestin es (also known as the colon).  The exact cause of UC is not 
known.  It is thought that UC is caused by an overactive immune system, which is 
normally responsible for fighting infections.  Medicines are available that lower the 
activity of the immune system , but some patients with UC do not get better when 
taking these medicines.  Some patients who do get better when taking these medicines 
still have their UC get worse over time.  Researchers are looking for new treatments 
that can help treat patients with U C.
PF-06480605 is an investigational medicine, and is a type of medicine that is called a 
“monoclonal antibody”.  Monoclonal antibodies are special proteins made by cells of 
the immune system that bind to and block the activity of other proteins.  
PF-06480 605 blocks the activity of an inflammatory protein called “TL1A”, which is 
thought to make UC worse.  By blocking this protein, researchers hope to lower 
inflammation in the large intestines and help patients with UC get better.
Researchers are studying PF -06480605 to see if it can safely treat moderate to severe 
UC.  To test the effectiveness of this medicine, the researchers asked:
Do patients treated with PF -06480605 have their UC improve after 14 weeks? 
To measure improvement, the researchers used a t est called the Mayo 
endoscopic subscore to measure how severe each patient’s UC was.
What medical problems do patients with UC have when they are treated 
with PF -06480605?

3WHAT HAPPENED DURING THE STUDY?
All 50 patients who were enrolled in this study received the investigational medicine. 
The study included men and women with moderate to severe UC who:
Were between the ages of 18 and 75
Were diagnosed with UC 4 or more months before entering the study
Had active disease above the rectum (the lowest part of the large intestines)
Were unable to tolerate, did not respond to, or lost response to at least 
1conventional therapy for UC (such as steroids, medications that suppress the 
immune system, or anti -TNF/anti -integrin inhibitors)
Did not have another medical condition that could be made worse by 
treatment with the study medication
This study consisted of a screening period, a treatment period, and a follow -up period.  
A diagram of the study is shown belo w.
In this study, “improvement” in a patient’s UC was measured using a test called the 
Mayo endoscopic subscore.  This test measures how severe a patient’s UC is on a 
scale of 0 to 3 (0 being the best and 3 being the worst).  Improvement was defined as 
reaching a Mayo endoscopic subscore of “0” or “1”.
While patients were only in the study for 8 months, the entire study took 2 years to 
complete.  The Sponsor ran this study at 13 locations in 6 countries in North 
090177e192bf3487\Approved\Approved On: 01-Feb-2020 13:22 (GMT)
4America, Europe, and Asia.  It began on 26 October 2016 and ended 22 August 2018.  
28men and 22 women participated.  All patients were between the ages of 20 and 68. 
Patients were to be treated until 14 weeks after their last dose of the investigational 
medicine, or until 2 or more patients devel oped the same serious medical problem or 
an abnormal heartbeat.  Of the 50 patients who started the study, 42 finished the 
follow -up period.  1 patient did not finish the study because the study medication 
wasn’t working, and 1 patient did not finish the s tudy because of a medical problem.  
6 patients left before the study was over by their choice or a doctor decided it was 
best for a patient to stop being in the study.
When the study ended in August 2018, the Sponsor began reviewing the information 
collect ed.  The Sponsor then created a report of the results.  This is a summary of that 
report.
WHAT WERE THE RESULTS OF THE STUDY?
Did patients treated with PF -06480605 have their UC 
improve after 14 weeks?
On average, 38% of patients in this study who took the test medicine saw their 
condition improve after 14 weeks of treatment.  The researchers expected about 
6%of patients to improve by chance after 14 weeks of treatment.  Based on these 
results, the researchers have decided that the results are not likely t he result of chance.  
The test medicine may be an option for treating patients with moderate to severe UC.
The researchers also looked at whether the patients had received certain types of 
medications before to treat their UC, called “anti -TNF” or “anti -integrin” inhibitors.  
46% of patients who had not received anti -TNF inhibitors before saw their UC 
improve, compared to 35% of patients who had received anti -TNF inhibitors.  
48% of patients who had not received anti -integrin inhibitors before saw their UC 
improve, compared to 29% of patients who had received anti -integrin inhibitors 
before.

5This does not mean that everyone in this study had these results.  Other studies may 
produce different results, as well.  These are just some of the main findings of t he 
study, and more information may be available at the websites listed at the end of this 
summary.  
WHAT MEDICAL PROBLEMS DID 
PARTICIPANTS HAVE DURING THE STUDY?
The researchers recorded any medical problems the participants had during the study.  
Partici pants could have had medical problems for reasons not related to the study (for 
example, caused by an underlying disease or by chance).  Or, medical problems could 
also have been caused by a study treatment or by another medicine the participant was 
taking .  Sometimes the cause of a medical problem is unknown.  By comparing 
medical problems across many treatment groups in many studies, doctors try to 
understand what the side effects of an experimental drug might be.

633 out of 50 patients in this study had a t least 1 medical problem.  1 patient left the 
study because of medical problems.  The most common medical problems are listed 
below.

WERE THERE ANY SERIOUS MEDICAL 
PROBLEMS?
A medical problem is considered “serious” when it is life -threatening, needs hospital 
care, or causes lasting problems.  
3 patients (6%, or 3 out of 50 patients) had serious medical problems that started 
during this study.  2 patients reported that their UC got worse, and 1 patient reported 
a serious abdominal infection (peritonitis).  1 patient reported serious hair loss, which 
might have been related to the study medicine.  No patients died during the study.
