2WHY WAS THIS STUDY DONE?
Osteoarthritis is a common disease of the joints that can happen when the cartilage, a 
protective tissue that covers the joints, begins to wear down over time .  This can 
cause symptoms such as pain, tenderness, stiffness, and loss of flexibility in the 
affected joints.  It can also cause “bone spurs”, or extra pieces of bone, to form 
around the joints.
There is currently no cure for osteoarthritis, but doctors can prescribe m edicines to 
manage pain and other symptoms.  These medicines may not work well for all 
patients with osteoarthritis, so researchers are looking for additional treatment 
options.   Tanezumab is being studied as a possible treatment option for osteoarthritis.   
Because it is still being tested, tanezumab has not been approved for use in patients.
The main purpose of this study was to learn more about how tanezumab works to 
treat osteoarthritis symptoms .  The researchers wanted to answer this question:
Did patients who received tanezumab have an improvement in osteoarthritis 
symptoms ,compared to patients who received placebo?
A placebo does not have any medicine in it, but looks just like the medicine.  
WHAT HAPPENED DURING THE STUDY?
This study compar ed 3groups of patients to find out if patients taking tanezumab 
would have an improvement in osteoarthritis symptoms .  To answer the research 
question, the researchers looked at 3 smaller questions :
Change in amount of pain due to osteo arthritis, from before study treatment to 
week 16 of the study.
Change in amount of physical difficulty due to osteo arthritis, from before study 
treatment to week 16 of the study.
Change in overall functioning, from before study treatment to week 16 of the 
study.

3The stud y included adult patients with osteoarthritis in the hip or knee, who did not 
get adequate pain relief from certain other pain medicines, or who were unable or 
unwilling to take certain other pain medicines . 
First, p atients were screened by the study doctor to make sure they were appropriate
to join the study.  This was known as the “ screening pe riod”, which lasted up to 
37days.  During this time, X -rays of the joints were taken, and osteoarthritis pain was 
assessed.
The next part of the study was the “treatment period” , which lasted 16 weeks. 
Patients were assigned to 1 of 3 treatment groups.  Patients were assigned to each 
group by chance alone. Putting people into groups by chance helps make the groups 
more similar so they can be compared.
Study treatments were given as an injection under the skin (subcutaneously) . Patients 
received a total of 2 injections during the study, 1 on the first day of the study and a 
second one 8 weeks later .
The study treatment s included:  
Group 1: Tanezumab 2.5 mg (day 1) , and tanezumab 5 mg (week 8)
Group 2: Tanezumab 2.5 mg (day 1), and tanezumab 2.5 mg (week 8)
Group 3: Placebo (day 1), and placebo (week 8)
The patients and researchers did not know who took tanezumab and wh o took the 
placebo ,since all treatment options looked the same .  This is known as a “blinded” 
study.  
At study visits in the clinic, starting at the screening visit, the patients completed 
questionnaires, like the questionnaires about pain from osteoarth ritis, physical 
disability from osteoarthritis, and overall well -being that were used to answer the 
research question. They also let the staff know about illnesses and discomforts, and 
had assessments (like physical exam, blood pressure, and more) done by the study 
doctors and other qualified personnel.

4Finally , there was a follow -up period, which lasted 24 weeks.  During this time, the 
study doctors monitored the patients for any medical problems.  The figure below
shows what happened during this study.
While patients were only in the study for about 40 weeks , the entire study took almost 
2 ½ years to complete.  The Sponsor ran this study at 73locations in Canada and the 
United States .  It began 21 January 2016 and ended 14 May 2018 .  243men (35%)and
453women (65%) participated.  All patients were between the ages of 27 and 85 . 
Patients were to be treated for 16 weeks and complete the 24 -week follow -up period . 
A total of 69 6patient s joined the study and received study treatment.  Of the se 
patients ,582(84%) finished the study .  There were 114 patients (16%) who left before 
the study was over by their choice or a doctor decided it was best for a patient to stop 
the study.
When the study ended in May 2018 , the Sponsor began reviewing the infor mation
collected.  The Sponsor then cr eated a report of the results. This is a summary of that 
report.

5WHAT WERE THE RESULTS OF THE STUDY?
Did patients who received tanezumab have an improvem ent in 
osteoarthritis symptoms, compared to patients who rece ived 
placebo?
To answer this question, the researchers looked at the patients’ questionnaire results 
rating their osteoarthritis symptoms in 3 areas (pain, physical difficulty due to 
osteo arthritis, and overall functioning) from before the start of study treatm ent and 
from week 16 to see if there was an improvement .On average, patients who received 
tanezumab at either dosing regimen had a greater improvement in osteoarthritis 
symptoms, compared to patients who received placebo . 
On average, p atients who receiv ed tanezumab 2.5 mg for dose 1 and 5 mg for dose 2
also had a slightly greater improvement in osteoarthritis symptoms com pared to 
patients who received 2doses of tanezumab 2.5 mg .
The researchers have decided that these results are not likely a result of chance.  
Tanezumab may be an option for treating patients with osteoarthritis. 
This does not mean that everyone in this study had these results . Other studies may 
produce different results , as well .  These are just some of the main findings of the 
study, and more information may be available at the websites listed at the end of this 
summary.  
WHAT MEDICAL PROBLEMS DID PATIENTS
HAVE DURING THE STUDY?
The researchers recorded any medical problems the patients had during the study. 
Patients could have had medical problems for reasons not related to the study (for 
example, caused by an underlying disease or by chance). Or, medical problems could 
also have been caused by a study treatment, or by another medicine the patient was 
taking. Sometimes the cause of a medical problem is unknown. By comparing 
medical problems across many treatment groups in many studies, doctors try to 
understand what the side effects of an experimental drug might be.

WERE THERE ANY SERIOUS MEDICAL 
PROBLEMS?
A medical problem is considered “serious” when it is life -threatening, needs hospital 
care, or causes lasting problems .  
A total of 17out of 696 patients (2%) in the study had serious medical problems , 
including 8 patients (4%) who received tanezumab 2.5 mg for dose 1 and 5 mg for 
dose 2 ,4patients (2%) who received tanezumab 2.5 mg for both doses , and 5 patients 
(2%) who received placebo.
2patients died during the study.  Both patients received tanezumab 2.5 mg for dose 1 
and 5 mg for dose 2.  The study doctors did not consider the sedeaths to be related to 
the study treatment.
