2WHY WAS THIS STUDY DONE?
Neurogenic detrusor overactivity, or “NDO”, is a bladder condition associated with 
damage to the nervous system.  NDO may be caused by injury or disease to the spinal 
cord, including certain conditions that are present from birth.  People with NDO may 
not be able to control their bladder and may not be able to hold as much urine in their 
bladder as other people can, so they may have urine leakage or need to urinate 
frequently.  Additionally, NDO can cause damage to the kidneys and urinary tract if it 
goes u nchecked. 
Current treatment options are limited for children and adolescents with NDO, so 
researchers are looking for new medicines that may help young people with this 
condition.  Fesoterodine was the investigational medicine tested in this study.  
Fesot erodine has not been approved for use in children or adolescents, outside of 
research studies like this one. 
The main purpose of this study was to learn more about the use and safety of 
fesoterodine in children and adolescents with NDO.  Researchers asked this main 
question:
Did bladder capacity increase following 12 weeks of treatment with 
fesoterodine? 
To answer this question, the researchers measured each patient’s bladder capacity 
(maximum volume of urine that can be held in the bladder before the patient needs to 
urinate) 2 times: before the patients started study medicine, and again after the patient 
had taken study medicine for 12 weeks.  They compared each patient’s first result to 
their second result.
WHAT HAPPENED DURING THE STUDY?
This study was done to find out if patients would have increased “bladder capacity” 
(be able to hold more urine) following 12 weeks of treatment with fesoterodine, 
compared to before they started taking study medicine.  Some of the patients were 
also compared to pati ents taking a medicine called oxybutynin XL.  Oxybutynin XL

3was selected to be the comparator medicine because it is widely used to treat NDO in 
children and adolescents. 
This study included children and adolescents who:
Were aged 6 to 17 years
Were diagn osed with NDO
Had stable nervous system disease, which means that their nervous system 
disease was not getting worse
Were checked by the study doctor for other health conditions, and were 
determined to be appropriate to join the study
The study included 4 parts:
A “run -in period” before the study started.  Patients were screened by the study 
doctors to make sure they were a good fit to join the study.  No study 
medicines were given during this period.
An “efficacy phase” for the first 12 weeks of study trea tment, when the 
researchers evaluated how well fesoterodine works, along with its safety.
A “safety extension phase” for the last 12 weeks of study treatment, when the 
researchers continued to evaluate the safety of fesoterodine.
A 2-week “follow -up phase” at the end of the study.
Children and adolescents in this study were divided into 2 groups, based on weight:
Group 1 (124 patients): Patients weighing more than 25 kilograms (about 
55pounds)
Group 2 (57 patients): Patients weighing 25 kilograms or less
Patients from Group 1 were assigned to receive 1 of 3 treatments: 
Fesoterodine 4 milligram (mg) tablets (42 patients) for both the efficacy phase 
and safety extension phase (24 weeks)
Fesoterodine 8 mg tablets (42 patients) for both the efficacy phase and safety 
extension phase (24 weeks)
090177e19513b88e\Approved\Approved On: 13-Oct-2020 05:31 (GMT)
4Oxybutynin XL tablets for the efficacy phase (12 weeks).  These patients were 
then switched to fesoterodine 4 mg or 8 mg tablets for the safety extension 
phase (12 weeks) (40 patients).
The patients were assigned to receiv e the treatments by chance alone, which is known 
as a “randomized” study.  This is done to make the groups more similar.  Reducing 
differences between the groups (like age or the number of boys and girls), makes the 
groups more even to compare.
Patients fr om Group 2 were assigned by chance alone to receive 1 of 2 treatments for 
both the efficacy phase and safety extension phase (24 weeks): 
Fesoterodine 2 mg capsules (28 patients)
Fesoterodine 4 mg capsules (29 patients)
This was an “open -label” study, whic h means that the patients, their families, and the 
study doctors knew which medicine the patients were taking.
Patients were expected to come to 8 study visits  They were checked by study doctors 
at each visit, to monitor for safety of the study medicines.   Bladder capacity was 
measured before the patients started study medicines, and again after they had been 
on the study medicines for 12 weeks.
The figure below shows what happened during the study.
Patients were expected to be in this study for about 26 weeks (24 weeks of treatment 
plus a 2 -week follow -up period).  The Sponsor ran this study at 102 locations in 
28countries in Africa, Asia, Europe, and North America.  The entire study took more

5than 7 years to complete.  It began 2 July 2012 and ended 13 February 2020.  A total 
of 95 boys (52%) and 86 girls (48%) participated in the study.  All patients were 
between the ages of 6 and 17 years. 
Patients were to be treated for 24 weeks.  Of the 124 pat ients in Group 1 who started 
the study, 101 patients (81%) finished the study.  Of the 57 patients in Group 2 who 
started the study, 48 patients (84%) finished the study.  A total of 23 patients from 
Group 1 (19%) and 9 patients from Group 2 (16%) left bef ore the study was over by 
their choice or because a doctor decided it was best for a patient to stop being in the 
study.
When the study ended in February 2020, the Sponsor reviewed the information 
collected.  The Sponsor then created a report of the result s.  This is a summary of that 
report.
WHAT WERE THE RESULTS OF THE STUDY?
Did bladder capacity increase following 12 weeks of 
treatment with fesoterodine?
The researchers measured each patient’s bladder capacity (maximum volume of urine 
that could be held in the bladder) 2 times: before the patient started study medicine, 
and again after the patient had taken study medicine for 12 weeks.  They compared 
each patient’s first result to their second result, to see if bladder capacity increased.
On average, pati ents from Group 1 who received fesoterodine 4 mg or 8 mg tablets 
had an increase in bladder capacity at week 12.  For the fesoterodine 8 mg tablet 
group, this increase was comparable to the increase seen in the patients who received 
oxybutynin XL.  Based o n these results, the researchers have decided that the results 
are not likely due to chance.  The test medicine may be an option for treating children 
and adolescents with NDO.
On average, patients from Group 2 who received fesoterodine 2 mg or 4 mg capsul es 
also had an increase in bladder capacity at week 12, but this was smaller than for 
Group 1, and smaller for the fesoterodine 2 mg capsule group than for the 
fesoterodine 4 mg capsule group.

6This does not mean that everyone in this study had these result s.  Other studies may 
produce different results, as well.  These are just some of the main findings of the 
study, and more information may be available at the websites listed at the end of this 
summary.  
WHAT MEDICAL PROBLEMS DID PATIENTS 
HAVE DURING THE STUDY?
The researchers recorded any medical problems the patients had during the study.  
Patients could have had medical problems for reasons not related to the study (for 
example, caused by an underlying disease or by chance).  Or, medical problems could 
also have been caused by a study treatment or by another medicine the patient was 
taking.  Sometimes the cause of a medical problem is unknown.  By comparing 
medical problems across many treatment groups in many studies, doctors try to 
understand what the side effects of an experimental drug might be.
During the efficacy phase (first 12 weeks of treatment), a total of 76 out of 
124patients in Group 1 (61%) had at least 1 medical problem.  In the fesoterodine 
4mg tablet group, 26 out of 42 patients (62%) h ad a medical problem.  In the 
fesoterodine 8 mg tablet group, 20 out of 42 patients (48%) had a medical problem.  
In the oxybutynin XL group, 30 out of 40 patients (75%) had a medical problem.  
Three out of 42 patients in the fesoterodine 4 mg tablet group (7%) left the study 
because of medical problems.  
A total of 67 patients in Group 1 received fesoterodine during both the efficacy phase 
and the safety extension phase.  46 of these patients (69%) had at leas t 1 medical 
problem.  One of these patients (1%) left the study because of medical problems.  
The most common medical problems are listed below.

WERE THERE ANY SERIOUS MEDICAL 
PROBLEMS?
A medical problem is considered “serious” when it is life -threatening, needs hospital 
care, or causes lasting problems.  
During the efficacy phase (first 12 weeks of treatment), a total of 6 out of 124 patients 
in Group 1 (5%) had serious medical problems.  In the fesoterodine 4 mg tablet 
group, 3 out of 42 patients (7%) had serious medical problems.  In the fesoterodine 
8mg tablet group, 2 out of 42 patients (5%) had serious medical problems.  In the 
oxybutynin XL group, 1 out of 40 patients (3%) had serious medical problems.  
Urinary tract infection was the most common serious medical problem and occurred 
in 2out of 124 p atients (2%), including 1 out of 42 patient s(2%) who received 
fesoterodine 4 mg tablets and 1 out of 40 patient s(3%) who received oxybutynin XL.  
None of the serious medical problems were considered to be related to study 
medicines.  No patients (0%) passed away during this phase of the study.
A total of 5 out of 67 patients from Group 1 (7%) who received fesoterodine during 
both the efficacy phase and the safety extension phase had serious medical problems, 
including 1 out of 30 patients (3%) who received fesoterodine 4 mg tablets and 4 out
