–Thank You –
If you participated in this study, Pfizer, the Sponsor, would like to thank you for your 
participation. 
This summary will describe the study results.  If you have any questions about the 
study or the results, please contact the doctor or staff at your study site.Why was this study done?
What is Type 2 diabetes mellitus ?
Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a disease which, over time, can cause higher than 
normal levels of sugar in the blood (hyperglycemia) and this can harm the health of 
people with T2DM.
Insulin is a hormone that lowers the level of sugar in the blood and glucagon is a 
substance which helps the body produce more sugar when it is needed.  With T2DM, 
the body does not release enough insulin intothe blood and can have too much 
glucagon in the blood .  This can lead to high levels of sugar in the blood.  If your 
blood sugar increases and remains high over a l ong period of time, this can lead to 
harmful effects such as heart problems, kidney disease, eye disorders and poor 
circulation in your limbs. That is why it is important to keep your blood sugar levels 
within a healthy range.
What is PF-07081532 ?
PF-07081532 is an experimental medicine that is taken as a tablet by mouth and is not 
yet approved for use by health authorities.  PF -07081532 is type of medicine known 
as a“glucagon -like peptide 1 receptor agonist ”and is intended to keep blood sugar at 
healthy levels . These medicines work by increasing theamount of insulin released and 
lowering the amount of glucagon released into the blood .  They also slow down the 
digestion of food and increase the feeling of fullness after eating .  PF-07081532 may 
help in lowering blood sugar levels and body weight if taken along with appropriate 
diet and exercise .
What was the purpose of this study?
Researchers wanted to see if different doses of PF-07081532 were safe when given to 
people with T2DM and people with obesity without diabetes . This report describes 
what happened during the study, what the results of the study are, and how 
participants can learn more about the study. Researchers wanted to know:
Were different doses of PF -07081532 safe in pa rticipants with 
T2DM and participants with obesity ?
What medical problems did participants have during the 
study?

How was the study done?
In this study, participants were given either PF -07081532 or a placebo. A placebo 
does not have any medicine in it but looks just like the medicine being tested. 
Researchers measured the effect of PF-07081532 by comparing side effects and other 
safety measurements of participants who took different doses of the study medicine
to participants who took a placebo.  The participants and researchers did not know 
who took different doses of PF -07081532 and who took the placebo.  This is known 
as a “double -blinded” study.  Researchers use “double -blinded” studies to make sure 
that th e results of the study are not influenced in any way.  Participants were assigned 
to each group by chance alone, like the flip of a coin.  This is known as a 
“randomized” study.   Randomization is done to make the groups more similar for 
characteristics lik e age and sex .
There were 2 participant populations enrolled in this study: participants with T2DM, 
and participants with obesity without diabetes.  The study was conducted in 3 parts: 
Part A, Part B ,and Part C.  Participants in each part were given either PF -07081532 
or placebo.  Each group started at 10 mg of PF -07081532, which increased after a set 
number of days until a target dose was reached.InPart A, 4 groups of participants with T2DM receiv ed PF -07081532 or 
placebo once a day for 28 days.  The target doses for the 4 groups in Part A 
were 10 mg, 30 mg, 60 mg,and 120 mg .  
In Part B, 1 group of participants with obesity (without diabetes) received 
PF-07081532 or placebo once a day for 42 days . The target dose for this group 
was 180 mg .
In Part C, 1 group of participants with T2DM received PF -07081532 or 
placebo once a day for 42 days. The target dose for this group was 180 mg.
After the Screening visit, participants began an in -patient stay at a study clinic and 
took PF-07081532 or placebo once a day from Day 1 to Day 28 (Part A) or Day1 to
Day 42 (Parts B and C).  Participants stayed at the clinic until after the last dose of
study medication and came back for a follow -up visit 7-14 days after taking their last 
dose of PF-07081532 or placebo.   
The study design is shown in the graphic below.
To find out if PF -07081532 was safe, the study doctors used different tests and 
assessments, such as testing blood and urine samples throughout th e study.  
Participants also had their heart rate, blood pressure, and electrical activity of the heart 
(by electrocardiogram [ECG] test) monitored.   Researchers also checked the 
participants’ health during the study and asked them how they were feeling. 
Researchers then compared the results of participants taking different doses of the 
study medication to the results of participants taking placebo.
Where did this study take place?
The Sponsor ran this study at 2locations in theUnited States .
When did this study take place?
It began 16 March 2020 and ended 14 July 2021 .
Who participated in this study?
The study included adult participants with T2DM and adult participants with obesity 
without diabetes who met certain criteria for things such as type of diabetes and body 
mass index ( BMI).  Participants with T2DM had blood sugar that was n ot under 
control with standard treatment with metformin, an approved medicine prescribed to 
them by their doctor.
A total of 35men participated
A total of 31women parti cipated
All participants were required to be between the ages of 18and 70
Of the 66participants who started the study, 61finished blinded treatment .Of the 
5participants who did not finish the study , 3 stopped because of treatment -related 
side effects given below :
1 participant with T2DM experienced nausea (a feeling of sickness in the 
stomach ), and left the study after receiving PF -07081532 for 13 days up to a 
dose of 40 mg1participant with T2DM experienced hypoglycemia (low blood sugar level) , 
and left the study after receiving PF -07081532 for 5 days up to a dose of 40 mg
1participant with obesity felt upper abdominal pain (pain in upper belly) , and 
stopped taking study drug after receiving PF -07081532 for 31 days up to a dose 
of 150 mg.
2particip ants (1 in T2DM and 1 in placebo) did not finish the study for other reasons .
How long did the study last?
Study participants were in the study for approximately 10 weeks (Part A), 12 weeks 
(Part B and Part C)including the Screening visit andon-site follow -up visit .  The 
entire study took about 16months to complete.
When the study ended in July 2021 , the Sponsor began reviewing the information 
collected.  The Sponsor then created a report of the results.  This is a summary of that 
report.
What were t he results of the study?
Were doses of PF -07081532 safe in participants with T2DM and 
participants with obesity ?
Yes, doses of PF -07081532 from 10 mg to 180 mg given once a day were found to be 
safe.
There were no harmful trends in the results of any of the safety tests done as part of 
the study (this included laboratory tests on blood and urine , blood pressure, pulse rate 
and ECG parameters ).  This means that the results of these tests did not appear to be 
meaningfully different with increasing PF -07081532 doses or placebo .Based on these results, comparing PF -07081532 to placebo, the researchers have 
decided that the results arenotlikely the result of chance.
This does not mean that everyone in this study had these results.  This is a summary 
of just some of the main results of this study.  Other studies may have different 
results.
What medical problems did participants have during 
the study?
The researchers recorded any medical problems the participants had during the study.  
Participants cou ld have had medical problems for reasons not related to the study (for 
example, caused by an underlying disease or by chance). Or, medical problems could 
also have been caused by a study treatment or by another medicine the participant was 
taking. Sometimes the cause of a medical problem is unknown. By comparing 
medical problems across many treatment groups in many studies, doctors try to 
understand what effects a study medication might have on a participant.
44out of 51(86%)participants with T2 DMand 14 out of 15 (93%)participants with 
obesity had at least 1 medical problem.   A total of 3participants left the study because 
of medical problems.  The most common medical problems –those reported by more 
than 5%of the total number of participant s–are described below.
Below are instructions on how to read Table 1. 
Instructions for Understanding Table 1. 
The 1stcolumn of Table 1lists medical problems that were commonly 
reported during the study.  All medical problems reported by more 
than 5%of participants are listed in decreasing order .
The 2nd-7thcolumn tells how many of the 66participants taking the 
PF-07081532 or placebo reported each medical problem.  Next to this number is the percentage of the participants taking the PF-07081532 or 
placebo who reported the medical problem. 
For example, using these instructions, you can see that a total of 26 out 
of the 52 (50%)participants taking PF -07081532 and a total of 4 out of 
the 14 (29%)participants taking a placebo reported nausea.  Using 
these instructions, you can see that nausea was reported by 19 out of 
the 40 (48%)participants with T2DM taking PF 07081532 and 3 out of 
the 11 (27%)participants with T2DM taking placebo .Table 1. Commonly reported medical problems by study participants

A medical problem is considered “serious” when it is life-threatening, needs hospital
care, or causes lasting problems.
1 participant ( 1out of 66 total participants )had serious medical problems.  
1participant with T2DM in the PF-07081532 30 mg group had obstructive 
pancreatitis .  
Study doctors believed the serious medical problem reported by the participant might 
be related to study medication. However, after final review, the serious medical 
problem was not thought to be related to the study drug by the sponsor. There were 
no deaths in this study .Where can I learn more about this study?
