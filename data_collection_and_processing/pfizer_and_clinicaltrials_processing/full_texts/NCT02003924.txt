1CLINICAL TRIAL RESULTS
This summary reports the results of only one study.  Researchers must look at the 
results of many types of studies to understand if a study medicine works, how it 
works, and if it is safe to prescribe to patients.  The results of this study might be 
differ ent than the results of other studies that the researchers review.

2WHY WAS THIS STUDY DONE?
Prostate cancer is the second most common type of cancer in men worldwide , and 
the sixth most common cause of cancer death in men .  Most prostate cancers depend 
on the male sex hormone testosterone to grow .  Early prostate canc er is treated by 
surgically removing the prostate gland, or by treating the prostate with radiation.  If 
the cancer comes back or is more advanced, most men with prostate cancer will be 
treated by “castration”, or lowering the amount of testosterone that their body makes .  
This is done either by surgery to remove the testi cles, or by taking drugs that stop the 
testicles from making testosterone.  However, about 10 -20% of men w ill have 
prostate cancer that continues to get w orse,even with surgery or drugs to lower 
testosterone . This type of prostate cancer is called “castration -resistant” prostate 
cancer.
Enzalutamide is an investigational medicine that reduces the activity of testosterone in 
the body . It does this by decreasing the ability of testosterone toconnect with 
“androgen receptors”, which are proteins on the surface of cells in the body that 
sense testosterone .  At the time of this study, e nzalutamide was approved in the 
United States of America ( USA)and the European Union ( EU)for the treatment of 
castration -resistant prostate cancer that has spread to other parts of the body (also 
called “metastatic” prostate cancer). However, there were no drugs approved to stop 
castration -resistant prostate cancer from begin ning to spread to other parts of the 
body when this study was conducted .  
The patients enrolled in this trial were men with a certain type of prostate cancer, 
called “castration -resistant with no evidence of metastasis”.  This means that their 
prostate cancer was getting worse, even with surgery or drugs to lower testosterone , 
but hadnot yet started to spread to other parts of the body.  The researchers in this 
study wanted to ask:
Do patients taking enzalutamide tr eatment go longer without their prosta te 
cancer spreading to other parts of the body ,or dying from any cause ?
Researchers were also interested in learning more about the safety of enzalutamide.  
They monitored the patients for any medical problems that happened while they were 
taking enzaluta mide , and for 30 days after they stopped taking enzalutamide .

3WHAT HAPPENED DURING THE STUDY?
This study compared 2groups of patients to find out if patients taking enzalutamide
went longer without their prostate cancer spreading to other parts of the body or 
dying from any cause ,compared to patients taking a placebo.  A placebo does not 
have any medicine in it, but looks just like the medicine. 
The study included patients who :
Were a t least 18 years old ,
Were d iagnosed with pr ostate cancer that had not spread to other parts of the 
body (also called “non -metastatic”) ,
Were c urrently taking drugs that stop the testi cles from making testosterone , or 
have had both testicles removed by surgery,
Had prostate cancer that was getting w orse, and
Were n ot feeling any s ymptom s of prostate cancer (also called 
“asymptomatic”).
The patients and researchers did not know who took enzalutamide and who took the 
placebo.  This is known as a “blinded” stu dy.  Patients were assigned to each group by
chance alone .  This is known as a “randomized” study.  This is done to make the 
groups more similar, which makes comparing the groups more fair. Twice as many 
patients were assigned to take enzalutamide compared to placebo.
Each patient in the study took either 160 mg of enzalutamide or placebo capsules by 
mouth once daily.  Patients who were taking drugs that stop the testicles from making 
testosterone continued to take these drugs during the study.  The patients were 
checke d every 16 weeks to see if their prostate cancer had started to spread.  This was 
done by a bone scan (to check for cancer in the bones) , followed by either a CT scan 
or an MRI scan (to check for cancer in the rest of the body).  The figure below shows 
what happened during the study.

4The sponsor ran this study at 254locations in 32countries in North and South 
America, Europe, Australia, and Asia .  It began on 26 November 2013 and is ongoing.   
A total of 1401 men participated in this trial .  All patients were between the ages of 
50and 95. 
Patients were to be treated until their prostate cancer got worse or until their doctor 
decided that they needed to start a different therapy for their prostate cancer . Patients 
may also have stopped taking enzalutamide if they had a serious medical problem.  Of 
the1401 patients who started the study, 1395 received at least 1 dose of enzalutamide 
or placebo .  As of June 2017, 206patients had left the study .  A total of 41 patients 
left before the study was over by their choice or a doctor decided it was best for a 
patient to stop the study.
When the study data was collected in June 2017 , the Sponsor began reviewing the 
infor mation collected.  The Sponsor then cr eated a r eport of the data collected up to 
that point in time . This is a summary of that report. Data collected after June 2017 is 
not part of this report.
WHAT WERE THE RESULTS OF THE STUDY?
Did patients taking enzalutamide go longer without their 
prostate cancer spreading to other parts of the body , or 
dying from any cause ?
The results suggested that patients taking enzalutamide went longer before their 
prostate cancer began to spread to other parts of their body , or before dying from any 
090177e192787ea2\Approved\Approved On: 18-Dec-2019 08:19 (GMT)
5cause, when compa red to patients taking the placebo.  A total of 219out of 
933patients ( 24%) in the enzalutamide group had their prostate cancer spread to 
other parts of the body or died from any cause during the study, compared to 228 out 
of 468 patients ( 49%) intheplacebo group .  Patients in theenzalutamide group went 
an average of 37months before their prostate cancer spread to other parts of the 
body or dying from any cause ,compared to an average of 15months in the placebo 
group . Based on these results, the researchers have decided that the results are not 
likely a result of chance.  Enzalutamide may be an option for treating patients with 
castration -resistant prostate cancer with no evidence of metastasis .  
This does not mean that everyone in this study had these results . Other studies may 
produce different results , as well .  These are just some of the main findings of the 
study, and more information may be available at the websites listed at the end of this 
summary.  
WHAT MEDICAL PROBLEMS DID PATIENTS
HAVE DURING THE STUDY?
The researchers recorded any medical problems the participant shad during the study. 
Participant s could have had medical problems for reasons not related to the study (for 
example, caused by an underlying disease or by chance). Or, medical problems could 
also have been caused by a study treatment, or by another medicine the participan t
was taking. Sometimes the cause of a medical problem is unknown. By comparing

6medical problems across many treatment groups in many studies, doctors try to 
understand what the side effects of an experimental drug might be.
Atotal of 1168 out of 1395 patients (84%) had at least 1 medical problem .  A total of 
131patients (9%) stopped taking their study medication because of medical problems.  
The most common medical problems are listed below.

7WERE THERE ANY SERIOUS MEDICAL 
PROBLEMS?
A medical problem is considered “serious” when it is life -threatening, needs hospital 
care, or causes lasting problems .  
Atotal of 311 patients ( 22%, or 1out of 5patients) had serious medical problems
during the study .  Not all of these problems were related to the study drug.  As of 
June 2017, a total of 165 patients haddied during the study.   Most deaths were due to 
the patient’s cancer getting worse.  The researchers determined that the serious health 
problems that 2 of the patient s had before they died (one patient hadtheir overall 
health gobad, and one patient hadbleeding in the intestines) may have been related to
taking the study drug .
