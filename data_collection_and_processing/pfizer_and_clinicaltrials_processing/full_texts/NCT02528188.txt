 
 1 CLINICAL TRIAL RESULTS  
 
This summary reports the results of only one study.  Researchers must look at the 
results of many types of studies to understand if a study medicine works, how it 
works, and if it is safe to prescribe to patients.  The results of this study might be 
differ ent than the results of other studies that the researchers review.

 2 WHY WAS THIS STUDY DONE?  
Osteoarthritis is a common joint condition that affects millions of people a round the 
world.  Osteoarthritis happens when the “carti lage” in the joint wears down through 
overuse , injury or patient age.  Cartilage is the  rubbery material that acts as padding , or 
a cushion , between t he bones in the joint and  stops the  bones  from rubbing together .  
When the cartilage wear s down , the joint  can become stiff and painful .  Osteoarthritis 
often affects the knees and hips but can be seen in other joints.   
Researchers did this study to compare the long -term pain relief and “joint safety”  of 
non-steroidal anti -inflammatory drugs ( also known as NSAIDs) with tanezumab in 
patients with osteoarthritis of the hips or knees.  Joint safety is a measure of how well 
the bone and joint are doing and whether there are any safety problems.  D octors 
often prescribe NSAIDs like naproxen, celecoxib, or diclofenac to help patients with 
their osteoarthritis .  Tanezumab is an “investigational drug”, which means it is not 
approved for use in the countries where the patients in this study live.  It is a new type  
of drug that is being studied to see if it may be able to help patients with osteoarthritis 
pain. 
WHAT HAPPENED DURING THE STUDY?  
This study compared 3 groups of patients to find out if patients receiving a 
“subcutaneous injection ” or shot of tanezumab that was given under the skin every 
8 weeks had the same safety and pain relief compared to patients taking a comparator 
medicine .  In this study, th e comparator medicine was tablets or capsules of NSAIDs  
that were to be taken twice a day .  The NSAIDs were naproxen 500  mg, celecoxib 
100 mg, or diclo fenac ER 75 mg.   
The study included patients with  osteoarthritis of the hip or knee who were 18 years 
of age or older and who were taking NSAIDs for their osteoarthritis because 
acetaminophen (also known as paracetamol) had not provided enough pain relief .  
The patient  also had to be unable to take tramadol or opioids for pain relief or had 
tried these treatments but found they did not work , or was unwilling to take opioids.   
The patients and researchers did not know who took tanezumab  and who took the 
comparator  treatment in this study .  This is known as a “blinded” stu dy.  Studies  such  
 3 as this will often use a “placebo” to help evaluate drug effects.  A placebo does not 
have any medicine in it, but looks just like the medicine being studied.  In this study, 
placebo treatment was given as either an injection , tablets or capsules so that everyone 
in the study received an injection (tanezumab or placebo) every 8 weeks and tablets or 
capsules  (placebo or NSAIDs) that they had to take twice a day.  Patients  were put 
into 1 of 3 treatment groups by chance alone  (see table below) .  This is known as a 
“randomized” study.  Putting people into groups by chance helps to make the groups more equal and easier to compare.   
 
Description of Medicines Given in Each Group

diclofenac  ER 75 mg) t ablets/capsules t aken twice a day  996 
 
   
 4 While patients were only in the study for about 21 months (80 weeks), the entire study 
took over 3 and a half years to complete.  The sponsor ran this study at 307 locations in 17 countries in Europe, North and South America, and in the Asia -Pacific area.  It 
began on 21  July 2015  and ended on 27 February 2019.  1043 men and 1953 women 
participated.  All patients were between the ages of 28 and 90 years.  
Patients were to be treated for up to 56 weeks and this was then followed by a 
24-week safety follow -up period when the patients were observed and no treatment 
was given (total of 80 weeks).  Of the 2996 patients who started the study an d 
received at least 1  injection in the study, 1312  patients finished the treatment period 
and 1684 patients did not finish the treatment period.  A total of 2227  patients 
completed the safety follow -up part of the study, whether or not they completed the 
treatment period.  A total of 769  patients left before the study was over by their 
choice or a doctor decided it was best for a patient to stop the study.  
When the study ended in February 2019, the Sponsor began reviewing the 
infor mation collected.  The Sponsor then cr eated a report of the results.  This is a 
summary of that report.

 6 WHAT WERE THE RESULTS OF THE STUDY?  
Did the tanezumab injection s help with osteoarthritis  pain?  
When patients came into the clinic at Week 16, they were asked to think a bout the 
osteoarthritis pain they had felt in the previous 2 days.  The patient’s answers to 
questions about this pain were used to work out a score that went from 0 to 10, with 
0 being the least pain and 10 being the most pain (see  figure).  On average, pain in 
patients given the tanezumab 5 mg injection was improved at Week 16 compared with 
the pain in patients who were given NSAIDs.  The researchers determined that the 
results were not likely a result of chance.  On average, pain in  patients given the 
tanezumab 2.5 mg injection was slightly improved at Week 16 compared with the pain in patients who were given NSAIDs.  The researchers could not rule out that the 
observed difference between the tanezumab 2.5  mg and NSAID groups was simply 
due to chance . 
Did the tanezumab injections help with the functioning of 
the joint affected by osteoarthritis? 
When patients came into the clinic at Week 16, they were asked about how their 
osteoarthritis affected them and their difficulties in moving around and doing the things that they normally wanted or needed to do in the previous 2 days.  The 
patient’s answer s to these questions were used to work out a score that went from 0 
to 10, with 0 being no reduction/ difficulty with physical function and 10 being the 
worst reduction/most difficulty with physical function possible (see  figure).  On 
average, functioning o f the joint affected by osteoarthritis in patients given the 
tanezumab 5 mg injection was improved at Week 16 compared with the functioning 
of the joint affected by osteoarthritis in patients who were given NSAIDs.  The 
researchers determined that the resu lts were not likely a result of chance.  On average, 
the functioning of the joint affected by osteoarthritis in patients given the tanezumab 
2.5 mg injection was slightly improved at Week 16 compared with the functioning of 
the joint affected by osteoarthr itis in patients who we re given NSAIDs.  The 
researchers could not rule out that the observed difference between the tanezumab 2.5 mg and NSAID groups was simply due to chance.   
 7 How did patients feel about their osteoarthritis during  
tanezumab treatment? 
When the patients attended the clinic at  Week 16, they were asked how they were 
doing after considering all the ways that their osteoarthritis affect ed them  (see figure) .  
This is the “patient ’s global assessment  of osteoarthritis”.  The  patient’s response 
ranged from 1  (= they had no symptoms of osteoarthritis and were able to do all of 
their normal activities) to 5  (= the symptoms were very bad and they could not do 
what they would normally want to do).  The re was no difference between the patients 
given t he tanezumab 5  mg injection and patients who were given NSAIDs in how 
they felt about their osteoarthritis in this patient ’s global assessment  of osteoarthritis .  
There was also no diffe rence between how patients in the tanezumab 2.5  mg and the 
NSAID group s felt about their osteoarthritis in this patient ’s global assessment of 
osteoarthritis.   
 
 
 8 How did tanezumab treatment  affect joint health ? 
The researchers look ed at joints (mainly the shoulders, hips and knees)  to see if the 
patient’s osteoarthritis was worsening more rapidly than usual , if the bone tissue had 
died, and/ or if there were any fractures of the bones in the  joint.  These conditions 
were seen in 3 9 out of 1002 patients (4%) in the tanezumab 2.5  mg gr oup, in 71 out 
of 998 patients (7%) in the tanezumab 5  mg group , and in 15 out of 996 patients  (2%) 
in the NSAID s group.  There was a lso a greater  risk or chance  of the osteoarthritis 
worsening more rapidly than expected,  the bone tissue dying , or a fracture developing 
in the tanezumab groups compared with  the NSAIDs  group.  The chance of this 
happening was higher in the tanezumab 2.5 mg and 5  mg group s than in the NSAIDs  
group .  The  researchers determined that t hese results were not likely a re sult of 
chance . 
This does not mean that everyone in this study had these results .  Other studies may 
produce  different results, as well .  These are just some of the main findings of the 
study, and more information may be available at the websites listed at  the end of this 
summary.    
WHAT MEDICAL PROBLEMS DID PATIENTS  
HAVE DURING THE STUDY?  
The researchers recorded any medical problems the pa rticipant s had during the study.  
Participant s could have had medical problems for reasons not related to the study (for 
example, caused by an underlying disease or by chance).  Or, medical problems could 
also have been caused by a study treatment, or by another medicine  the participan t 
was taking.  Sometimes the cause of a medical problem is unknown.  By comparing 
medical problems across many treatment groups in many studies, doctors try to 
understand what the side effects of an experimental drug might be.  
A total of 1900 out of the 2996 patients (63%) treated in this study had at least 1 
medical problem  during the treatment period of the study .  A total of 50 patients left 
the study during the treatment period because of medical problems.  The most 
common medical problems are listed in the following table.

WERE THERE ANY SERIOUS MEDICAL 
PROBLEMS?  
A medical problem  is considered “serious” when it is life -threatening, needs hospital 
care, or causes lasting problems.   
A total of 177  patients ( 6%, or 177  out of 2996 patients ) had serious medical 
problems during the treatment period .  This included 51  patients in the tanezumab 
2.5 mg group (5%), 80 pa tients (8%) in the ta nezumab 5  mg group , and 46 patients 
(5%) in the NSAID group.  The serious medical problems of osteoarthritis, rapidly 
worsening osteoarthritis, and pain in the joints were seen more often in the 
tanezumab 5  mg group than in the tanezumab 2.5 mg group or the NSAID group.  
Serious medical problems that occurred in more than 2 patients in any treatment  
group are shown in the following table.  All  other serious medical problems occurred 
in 1 or 2 patients in eac h treatment group .  
 11 There were 10 patients who died during the study.  This included  5 patients who died 
during the treatment period, 3  patients who died during the safety follow -up period 
and 2  patients who died after they had left the study.  The doctors did not think any 
of these deaths were linked to the treatment s given  in this study.
