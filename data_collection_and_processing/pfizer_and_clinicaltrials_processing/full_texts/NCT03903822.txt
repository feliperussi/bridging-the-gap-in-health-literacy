CLINICAL TRIAL RESULTS
This summary reports the results of only one study.  Researchers must look at the 
results of many types of studies to understand if a study medicine works, how it 
works, and if it is safe to prescribe to patients.  The results of this study might be 
different than the results of other studies that the researchers review.

2WHY WAS THIS STUDY DONE?
Atopic dermatitis (or “AD”), which is also sometimes called atopic eczema, is a 
common skin condition that causes patches of dry, red, and very itchy skin.  AD 
occurs in up to 36% of children and up to almost 23% of adults worldwide.   Some of 
the current medicines available for AD can only be used for short time periods, or can 
cause other health problems.  Researchers are looking for new treatments for AD that 
can be applied to the skin that can also be used for long periods of time.
Brepocitinib (also called PF -06700841) is an experimental medicine that has not been 
approved for sale yet.  Brepo citinib blocks 2 enzymes (special proteins that cause 
chemical reactions in the body) called “Tyrosine Kinase 2 ”(TYK2) and “Janus kinase 
1 (JAK1) ”. TYK2 and JAK1 act like a switch for the cells of the immune system (the 
body’s defense against infection a nd inflammation). By turning off this switch, the 
cells of the immune system are expected to produce fewer chemical signal s believed to 
cause AD.  Brepocitinib was given in the form of a cream that is applied to areas of 
skin affected by AD.
The main purp ose of this study was to explore the effect of multiple doses of 
brepocitinib on AD.   The study also tested whether applying brepocitinib cream 
once-a-day or twice -a-day had a better effect in treating AD.  The researchers asked,
Are patients who are treated with brepocitinib cream more likely to have 
their AD improve compared to patients treated with a vehicle cream ?
In this study, the “ vehicle cream ” was skin cream that looked just like the skin cream 
containing the study medicin e(brepocitinib) , but did not have any medicine in it.  
To answer this question, the researchers used a tool called the EASI ( Eczema Area 
and Severity Index).  The EASI measures how severe a patient’s AD is based on 
4different signs, as well as the total amount of a patient’s skin affected by AD.  The 
researchers also monitored the patients for any medical problems they had while in 
the study.

3WHAT HAPPENED DURING THE STUDY?
This study compared patients using different dose strengths and 2 application 
schedules to find out if patients who were treated with brepocitinib cream were more 
likely to have their AD improve compared to patients treated with a vehicle cream .  
The study included adults and childre n who were diagnosed with mild to moderate 
ADat least 3 months before enrolling in the study.  Study participants must not have 
taken drugs like brepocitinib ( called “TYK2 inhibitors” or “JAK inhibitors ”) in the 
3months before they were screened for the study .
The patients and doctors did not know who used brepocitinib cream and who used 
the vehicle cream.  This is known as a “double -blinded” study.  This is done to make 
sure the results of the research study cannot be unfairly influenced by anyone .  
Patients were assigned to 1 of the 8treatment groups by chance (like the flip of a coin 
or drawing straws).  This is known as a “randomized and vehicle -controlled” study.
While patients were only in the study for up to 16 weeks, the entire study took 
12month s to complete.  The Sponsor ran this study at 70 locations in 10 countries in 
North America, Australia, Europe ,and Japan.  It began on 13 May 2019 and ended on 
07May 2020.  A total of 136 men/boys and 156 women participated.  All patients 
were between th e ages of 13 and 74. 
Patients were to be treated until they completed the study treatment phase, until they 
chose to stop, or until they had certain medical problems .  Of the 292 patients who 
started the study, 240 finished the treatment phase and 245 fin ished the follow -up 
phase of the study.  A total of 52 patients did not finish the treatment phase and 
47patients did not finish the follow -up phase of the study.  A total of 22 patients 
stopped treatment before the study was over by their choice , and 2 p atients stopped 
treatment because a doctor decided it was best for a patient to stop being in the study.
The graphic on the next page shows what happened during the study.

4When the study ended in May 2020 , the Sponsor began reviewing the information 
collected.  The Sponsor then created a report of the results. This is a summary of that 
report.
WHAT WERE THE RESULTS OF THE STUDY?

5Were patients who were treated with brepocitinib cream 
more likely to have their AD improve compared to patients 
treated with a vehicle cream?
Yes.  Patients using 1% brepocitinib cream once daily had an average decrease in their 
EASI score of -70%, compared to -44% using vehicle cream.  Patients using 1% 
brepocitinib cream twice daily had an average decrease in their EASI score of -75%, 
compared to -48% using vehicle cream.  The researchers do not think these results are
likely the result of chance.  On average, all of the tested dose strengths and treatment 
schedules of brepocit inib cream decreased patients’ EASI scores more than the 
vehicle cream .

6This does not mean that everyone in this study had these results.  Other studies may 
produce different results , as well .  These are just some of the main findings of the 
study, and more information may be available at the websites listed at the end of this 
summary.  
WHAT MEDICAL PROBLEMS DID 
PARTICIPANTS HAVE DURING THE STUDY?
The researchers recorded any medical problems the participants had during the study.
Participants could have had medical problems for reasons not related to the study (for 
example, caused by an underlying disease or by chance). Or, medical problems could 
also have been caused by a study treatment o r by another medicine the participant was 
taking. Sometimes the cause of a medical problem is unknown. By comparing 
medical problems across many treatment groups in many studies, doctors try to 
understand what the side effects of an experimental drug mig ht be.
One hundred and eight ( 108)out of 292patients in this study had at least 1 medical 
problem.  A total of 16patients left the study because of medical problems.  The most 
common medical problems are listed on the next page .

8WERE THERE ANY SERIOUS MEDICAL 
PROBLEMS?
A medical problem is considered “serious” when it is life -threatening, needs hospital 
care, or causes lasting problems.  
No patients had serious medical problems that started after they began study 
treatment . No patients died during this study.
