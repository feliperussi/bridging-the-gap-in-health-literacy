CLINICAL TRIAL RESULTS
This summary reports the results of only one study.  Researchers must look at the 
results of many types of studies to understand if a study medicine works, how it 
works, and if it is safe to prescribe to patients.  The results of this study might be 
different than the results of other studies that the researchers review.

2WHY WAS THIS STUDY DONE?
Lung cancer is the name for cancer that starts in the lungs.  Non -small cell lung 
cancer (NSCLC) is the most common type of lung cancer.  Some patients have 
NSCLC that is referred to as “anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) -negative” or “c -ros 
oncogene 1 (ROS1) -positive”.  These patients have changes in their genes that can 
cause cancer cells to grow.
The Sponsor is developing an anti -cancer medication called crizotini b to treat 
ALK -negative and ROS1 -positive lung cancers.  ALK and ROS1 belong to a certain 
group of proteins called “kinases”.  These proteins can help cancer cells to grow.  As 
they grow, the cancer cells can form into a tumor and spread to other parts of the 
body.  Crizotinib may be able to block kinases, potentially reducing tumor size and 
stopping ALK -negative and ROS1 -positive lung cancers from being able to grow and 
spread.  Crizotinib is known as an “ALK -inhibitor and ROS1 -inhibitor” medication.
Xalko ri®(crizotinib) is approved in the United States ( US), Europe, and countries in 
East Asia including South Korea, Taiwan, Japan, and China, for treatment of locally 
advanced (cancer has not spread to distant regions of the body but has spread to 
nearby organs) or metastatic (cancer has spread outside lungs) NSCLC that are 
ALK -positive.  Crizotinib is also approved in the US and Europe for advanced 
(metastatic) NSCLC whose tumors have an ROS1 gene alteration, resulting in 
ROS1 -positive NSCLC.  Crizotinib is given in a capsule and is taken by mouth twice 
daily at around the same time every morning and every evening.
The main purpose of this study was to see if treatment with crizotinib is useful in 
patients in East-Asia, including South Korea, Taiwan, Japan , and China, with 
ROS1 -positive and ALK -negative NSCLC.  To do this, researchers asked:
How well did crizotinib treatment work to keep ROS1 -positive and 
ALK -negative NSCLC from growing?
The researchers also wanted to know if any of the patients’ cancer got smaller during 
the study.  To do this, they measured many things, including the “ Objective Response

3Rate”.  This is the percentage of patients whose cancer disappeared or got smaller 
during treatment.
Researchers were also interested in learning more abou t the safety of crizotinib.  They 
monitored the patients for any medical problems that happened while they were 
taking crizotinib or after they stopped taking crizotinib.
WHAT HAPPENED DURING THE STUDY?
The study included patients who had NSCLC (referred t o as “disease” in this 
summary) that was advanced or has spread to other parts of the body during or after 
earlier treatment and was caused by a defect in a gene called receptor tyrosine kinase 
(C-ROS1).
A total of 129 patients with ALK -negative andROS1 -positive NSCLC joined this 
study and 127 patients were treated with crizotinib.
This was an open -label study, which means that both the patients and researchers 
knew which study drug and dose they received.  The figure below shows what 
happened durin g this study.
Patients in this study took crizotinib 2 times per day in “cycles” that lasted 28 days.  
They began with a dose of 250 mg.  The patients were watched closely for any 
medical problems.

4While patients were only in the study for an average o f 102 weeks, the entire study 
took almost 7 years to complete.  The Sponsor ran this study at 40locations in 
4countries in East Asia (Japan, China, South Korea, and Taiwan).  It began 
25September 2013 and ended 22 January 2020.  Fifty -four (54) men and seventy -
three (73) women participated.  All patients were between the ages of 23 and 80. 
Patients were to be treated until their cancer stopped responding or got worse, until 
they developed unacceptable medical problems, or until they chose to stop treatm ent.  
Of the 127 patients who started the study, all patients stopped the study; 65 patients 
(51%) died.  A total of 18 patients (14%) had stopped the study by their choice or a 
doctor decided it was best for a patient to stop the study.  Forty -four (44) patients 
(35%) were still ongoing in the study when the study was closed and, if they were still 
on treatment, they were moved to either commercial treatment available in their 
country or they enrolled into another study (Study A8081067).  
When the study e nded in January 2020, the Sponsor began reviewing the information 
collected.  The Sponsor then created a report of the results.  This is a summary of that 
report.
WHAT WERE THE RESULTS OF THE STUDY?
What percentage of patients in the study had their NSCLC 
get better when taking crizotinib?
Seventeen (17) patients (13%) had a ‘Complete Response’, which means that their 
NSCLC completely disappeared.  Seventy -four (74) patients (58%) achieved a ‘Partial 
Response’, which means that their NSCLC got smaller, but did not disappear.  The 
Objective Response Rate (Complete Response + Partial Response) for all patients, 
was therefore 72%.  Nine (9) (7%) of patients’ NSCLC worsened.  
This does not mean that every one in this study had these results.  Other studies may 
produce different results, as well.  These are just some of the main findings of the 
study, and more information may be available at the websites listed at the end of this 
summary.

5WHAT MEDICAL PROB LEMS DID 
PARTICIPANTS HAVE DURING THE STUDY?
The researchers recorded any medical problems the participants had during the study.  
Participants could have had medical problems for reasons not related to the study (for 
example, caused by an underlying disea se or by chance).  Or, medical problems could 
also have been caused by a study treatment or by another medicine the participant was 
taking.  Sometimes the cause of a medical problem is unknown.  By comparing 
medical problems across many treatment groups in many studies, doctors try to 
understand what the side effects of an experimental drug might be.
One-hundred and twenty -seven (127) out of 127 patients in this study had at least 
1medical problem.  A total of 1 1patients (9%) stopped treatment because of medical 
problems.  The most common medical problems are listed below.

white blood cell called neutrophils 
(Neutropenia)45 (35%)
Edema (when body fluids build 
up too much)45 (35%)
Nose and throat infection 44 (35%)
WERE THERE ANY SERIOUS MEDICAL 
PROBLEMS?
A medical problem is considered “serious” when it is life -threatening, needs hospital 
care, or causes lasting problems.   
Forty -six (46) patients (36%) had serious medical problems.  There were 
11(9%) patients with serious medical problems that researchers believe was related to 
crizotinib.  Sixty -five (65) patients (51%) died during the study, 1 patient (1%) died 
within 30 days after receiving cri zotinib.  Most of the patients who died during the 
study, was because their condition worsened.
