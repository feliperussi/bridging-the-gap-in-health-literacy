2WHY WAS THIS STUDY DONE?
Streptococcus pneumoniae is a bacteria that can cause serious diseases, including infections 
of the lung ( pneumonia ), brain lining ( meningitis ), blood ( bacteremia ), or ear ( otitis ).  
These infections may be very serious in young children and older adults.  Streptococcus 
pneumoniae is also known as S.pneumoniae .  There are 100 types of S. pneumoniae.
This study is about a vaccine called the “20 -valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine”, 
or 20vPnC.  A vaccine is used to help prevent infection by helping the body to fight 
off germs.  20vPnC may help to prevent infections caused by S.pneumoniae.  It is call ed 
"20-valent" because 20vPnC prevents 20 of the most common types of S.pneumoniae .
20vPnC is an investigational vaccine, which means that it has not been approved for 
general use and it is not yet known if it will protect against disease caused by 
S. pneumoniae, although studies are ongoing to assess how well 20vPnC works.
After a vaccine is injected into a person’s body, the body responds to help fight 
infections and prevent diseases.  The response to vaccines includes making 
“antibodies”, which are p roteins that fight infections and help to prevent diseases .  
In the United States, the “13 -valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine”, or 13vPnC, is 
currently approved for preventing S. pneumoniae diseases in children and adults.  
13vPnC is made up of compon ents to prevent diseases caused by 13 types of 
S.pneumoniae.  20vPnC has the same components found in 13vPnC, plus 7 additional 
components that may widen protection .The Pneumovax 23 vaccine, or PPSV23, is 
made up of components to prevent diseases caused by 23 types of S. pneumoniae.
The purpose of this study was to learn about the safety and about the antibody 
response to 20vPnC .  
To learn about the antibody response, researchers asked these questions:
For the 13 components found in both 13vPnC and 20vPnC, did participants 
aged 60 or older who received 20vPnC have antibody responses that were 
within a range considered to be comparable (noninferior) to those who 
received 13vPnC ?

3For the 7 additional compo nents found in both PPSV23 and 20vPnC, did 
participants aged 60 or older who received 20vPnC have antibody responses 
that were within a range comparable to those who received PPSV23 ?
To answer this question, the researchers measured the amount of antibodie s in 
participants’ blood 1 month after being vaccinated .
To learn about the safety of 20vPnC , researchers asked these questions :  
What percentage of participants had redness, swelling, or pain at the injection 
site within 10 days after being vaccinated ?
What percentage of participants had fever, headache, tiredness, muscle pain, or 
joint pain within 7 days after being vaccinated ?
What significant medical problems did participants have within 1 month after 
being vaccinated ?
Did participants have any newly diagnosed chronic medical problems or any 
serious medical problems within 6 months after being vaccinated ? 
WHAT HAPPENED DURING THE STUDY?
This study included 3 different age ranges of participants to learn about the safety and 
about the antibody response to 20vPnC . The main age range studied was participants 
60 years old and above.  The vaccines used in this study included 20vPnC, 13vPnC, 
PPSV23, and salt water (saline) placebo.  A placebo is given in the same way as the 
vaccines used in study but does n ot have active ingredients.  20vPnC and 13vPnC 
looked the same; however, the saline and PPSV23 looked different and were injected 
by staff that were not involved in other aspects of the study. Participants were asked 
to turn their heads when the PPSV23 or saline was injected so they would not know 
which one they had received.  
Participants were checked (screened) to make sure they were a good fit for the study.  
This study included adult men and women who:
Were at least 18 years old
Were considered to be healthy or with stable chronic disease by the study 
doctors
090177e194d66610\Approved\Approved On: 23-Sep-2020 07:13 (GMT)
4Did not have a disease or take medicine that would be associated with a 
weakened immune system
Never received any vaccine for S.pneumoniae
Never had a disease caused by S.pneumoniae
Never had a severe medical problem caused by a vaccine or an allergic reaction 
to any of the components in the vaccines used in this study
Participants of 3 different age ranges were entered into the study.
60 years of age and older ( 3009 participants)
50 through 59 y ears of age (445 participants)
18 through 49 years of age (44 8participants)
Next, participants in the 3 age ranges were assigned to vaccine groups by chance 
alone, and received the following vaccinations :
60 years and older :  
Vaccine Group 1: 20vPnC at Visit 1 and placebo at Visit 2 one month later 
(1507participants)
Vaccine Group 2: 13vPnC at Visit 1 and PPSV23 at Visit 2 one month later 
(1490participants )
50 through 59 years of age:
Vaccine Group 1: 20vPnC at Visit 1 (33 4participants)
Vaccine Group 2: 13vPnC at Visit 1 (111 participants)
18 through 49 years of age: 
Vaccine Group 1: 20vPnC at Visit 1 (335 participants)
Vaccine Group 2: 13vPnC at Visit 1 (112 participants)
This was a “randomized” study, which means that participants were assigne d to 
groups based on chance alone.  Randomization is done to make the groups similar so 
that differences in antibody response or safety are most likely due to the different 
vaccines p articipants received.

5This study was also “double -blinded”.  This means that participants and study staff 
members who administered the vaccine did not know who was given which vaccine.  
This was done to make sure that the study results were not influenced in any way.
Participants 60 years of age and older were expected to par ticipate in 3 study visits.   
At the first visit, blood samples were collected first and then participants received 
either 20vPnC or 13vPnC.  The second visit was done about 1 month after the first 
visit. Blood samples were collected before the participants received either saline 
placebo or PP SV23, and they were checked for medical problems.  The third visit was 
done about 1 month after the second visit.  Blood samples were collected and 
participants were asked about medical problems.
Participant s 18 to 59 years of age were expected to participate in 2 study visits.  At the 
first visit, blood samples were collected first and then participants received either 
20vPnC or 13vPnC.  The second visit was done about 1 month after the first visit. 
Blood s amples were collected and participants were asked about medical problems.
All participants were also contacted over the phone about 6 months after Visit 1.  The 
participants were asked about medical problems and whether they had received any 
other vaccines besides the study vaccines.

090177e194d66610\Approved\Approved On: 23-Sep-2020 07:13 (GMT)7While participants were in this study for about 6 months, the entire study took more 
than a year to complete as participants entered the study at different times.  The 
Sponsor ran this study at 61 locations in the United States and Sweden.  It began 
12December 2018 and ended 16 December 2019.  1558 men (40%) and 2331 women 
(60%) received the study vaccines .  All participants were between the ages of 18 and 
91years. 
Of the 3902 participants who joined the study, 3690 (95%) completed it.  A total of 
212 participants (5%) left the study early. The most common reasons for leaving early 
were the participant's choice or because a doctor decided it was best for them to stop 
the study.
Throughout the course of the study, the Sponsor reviewed the data. When the study 
ended in December 2019 and after antibody testing was completed, the Sponsor then 
created a report of the results.  This is a summary of that report .
WHAT WERE THE RESULTS OF THE STUDY?
For the 13 components found in both 13vPnC and 20vPnC,
did participants aged 60 or older who received 20vPnC have 
antibody responses that were within a range considered to 
be comparable (noninferior) to those who received 13vPnC?
To evaluate antibody response, the researchers measured the amount of antibodies in 
participants’ blood 1 month after being vaccinated with 13vPnC or 20vPnC.   
The researchers found that antibody levels for each of these 13 vaccine components 
in participants after 20vPnC wer e within a range considered to be comparable 
(noninferior) to those in participants after 13vPnC.  Therefore, the participants who 
received 20vPnC had comparable antibody responses to the participants who received 
13vPnC. Based on these results, the resea rchers have decided that the results are not 
likely the result of chance.  20vPnC may be an option for preventing S.pneumoniae 
diseases.

8For the 7 additional components found in both PP SV23 and 
20vPnC, did participants aged 60 or older who received 
20vPnC have antibody responses that were within a range 
comparable to those who received PP SV23?
To evaluate antibody response, the researchers measured the amount of antibodies in 
participant s’ blood 1 month after being vaccinated with PPSV23 or 20vPnC .   
The researchers found that antibody levels for 6 of the 7 additional vaccine 
components after 20vPnC were within a range considered to be comparable 
(noninferior) to those in participants af ter PP SV23.  Therefore, the participants who 
received 20vPnC had antibody responses that were comparable to the participants 
who received PP SV23 for these 6 components, and in fact had higher antibody levels.  
For 1 of these 7 additional vaccine component s, antibody levels were found to be in a 
slightly lower range in participants who received 20vPnC compared to those who 
received PPSV23.  However, the researchers still expected 20vPnC to produce an 
adequate antibody response for this component. Based on these results, the 
researchers have decided that the results are not likely the result of chance.  20vPnC 
may be an option for preventing S.pneumoniae diseases.
This does not mean that everyone in this study had these results.  Other studies may 
produce different results, as well.  These are just some of the main findings of the 
study, and more information may be available at the websites listed at the end of this
summary.  
WHAT MEDICAL PROBLEMS DID 
PARTICIPANTS HAVE DURING THE STUDY?
The researchers recorded any significant medical problems the participants had during 
the study.  Participants could have had medical problems for reasons not related to 
the study (f or example, caused by an underlying disease or by chance).  Or, medical 
problems could also have been caused by study vaccine or by another medicine the 
participant was taking.  Sometimes the cause of a medical problem is unknown.  By
