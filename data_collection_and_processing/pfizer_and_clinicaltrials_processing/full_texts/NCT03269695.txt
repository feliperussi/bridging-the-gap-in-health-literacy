Why was this study done?  
What is ulcerative colitis ? 
Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a long -term inflammatory bowel disease that causes 
inflammation (swelling) and ulcers (sores) in the digestive tract.  UC affects the 
mucosa (inner lining) of the large intestine (colon) and rectum.  People with UC 
experience occasional periods of increased inflammation, known as active disease or flares.  These periods of active disease are characterized by diarrhea (loose stools) and 
presence of blood in the stool s, as well as sense of urgency.  Active disease is often 
followed by periods of remission (time with no symptoms) that vary in length from 
weeks to years.  
There is no known cure for UC.  Treatment can greatly reduce signs and symptoms of UC and can even le ad to long -term remission.  Medication is the most common 
treatment for UC and b iologic therapies like infliximab, adalimumab, and golimumab 
are often used .  A biologic therapy is a treatment that  has been developed from a 
natural source , such as a component found in the body, but then u pdated in the 
laboratory  so that it can be used to treat a disease.  Biologics are usually produced 
using  biotechnology methods .  Some people do not respond to these biologics or the 
treatment can stop working after a  while.  Other medicines that can be used with the  
biologic therapy are needed.  
What is PF -06687234 ? 
At the time this study started, PF -06687234 was an experimental treatment being 
developed for people with UC that could be used with infliximab.  PF -06687234 is 
given by a subcutaneous injection weekly.  Subcutaneous means the injection is given under the skin.  
This study was the first time PF -06687234 was used in participants with UC.  This 
study was stopped early after the researchers looked at data and saw that 
PF-06687234 was not working as well as they hoped .  
What was the purpose of this study?  
Researchers did this study to learn if PF -06687234 could help participants with UC 
achieve remission as well as if this treatment was safe.  
Researchers wanted t o know:  
• Did the participants taking PF -06687234 and infliximab 
achieve remission ? 
• Is treatment with PF -06687234 safe and well tolerated ? 
 
What happened during the study?   
How was the study done?  
Researchers tested PF -06687234 i n a group of study participants to find out if study 
participants taking  this treatment could achieve remission of their UC  when also given 
infliximab .  Infliximab is a licensed treatment for UC.   
Researchers then compared the results of study participant s taking the study 
medication to the results of study participants taking placebo  and infliximab .  A 
placebo does not have any medicine in it, but it looks just like the study medication.   
The study participants and researchers did not know who took  PF-06687234 and who 
took the placebo.  This is known as a “blinded” study.  Study participants were 
assigned to each group by chance alone.  
The figure on the next page shows what happened during this study.   
 
SC = subcutaneous . 
Note: All p articipants were to remain in the study for 22 weeks even if they stopped the study treatment 
before they had completed 12 weeks of treatment  so that they could be monitored for safety .   
Where did this study take place?  
The Sponsor ran this study at 27 l ocations in 1 1 countries in  the United States, 
Europe, the Middle East , Asia, and Australia.  
When did this study take place?  
It began 20  December  2017 and ended  07 January  2021. 
 
Who participated in this study?  
The study included participants who had active UC and who had partially responded 
to treatment with infliximab , but who had not achieved remission.  Participants d id 
not have other bowel diseases, such as Crohn’s disease, infectious colitis, or colon 
cancer.  
• A total of 13 men participated  
• A total of 7  women participated  
• All participants were between the ages of 20 and 73 years.  
Participants were to be treated for 12 weeks with PF -06687234 and infliximab and a 
further 10 weeks when PF -06687234 was to be stopped but infliximab was continued.  
Of the 20 participants who started the study, 19 participants finished the study and 
completed the safety follow -up.  There were 15 participants who finished the 
12 week s of treatment  (7 in the PF -06687234 group and 8 in the placebo group)  and 
5 participants d id not finish treatment .  The participants who did not finish treatment 
included : 
• 3 participants in the PF -06687234 group  
o 1 partici pant because of medical problems  
o 1 participant because of lack of treatment effect  
o 1 participant by their own choice  
• 2 participants in the placebo group  
o both because of medical problems.  
How long did the study last?  
Study participants were in the study for  22 weeks .  The entire study ran for  just over 
3 years.  This study was stopped because PF -06687234 was not working as well as the 
researchers hoped .  
When the study ended in  January 2021, the Sponsor began reviewing the information 
collected.  The Sponsor then created a report of the results.  This is a summary of that 
report.  
What were the results of the study?  
Did participants taking PF -06687234 and infliximab achieve 
remission ?  
In this study, the researchers used remission  to measure treatment effect  for 
participants treated with PF -06687234 plus infliximab or placebo plus infliximab.  
Remission happens when the participant responds to treatment and the s igns and 
symptoms of UC are no longer present.  The remission  involved  resolving UC 
symptoms as well as  looking at what was happening in the large bowel using an 
endoscope  to see if UC was present .  An endoscope is a thin flexible tube that has a 
light and camera on the end that can be used to display images from inside the body 
on a television screen.  The results were then  analyzed for remission for each 
treatment group.  
 
 
  
 
 
  
 
In general, t here was no difference between participants who took PF-06687234 plus 
infliximab and participants who took placebo  plus infliximab.  
Did the study medication help participants achieve remission 
compared to placebo?  
On average,  10% to 14% o f participants who took PF -096687234 plus infliximab  
achieved remission  at Week 12 , while about 10% to 13% of  the participants taking 
placebo plus infliximab achieved remission.  
Based on these results, the researchers have decided that the results are  likely the 
result of chance.  This means the study results did not show that one treatment was 
better than another at helping participants ac hieve remission . 
This does not mean that everyone in this study had these results.  These are just some of the main findings of this study.  Other studies may have different results.  
What medical problems did participants have during 
the study?  
The researchers recorded any medical problems the participants had during the study.  
Participants could have had medical problems for reasons not related to the study (for 
example, caused by an underlying disease or by chance).  Or, medical problems could  
also have been caused by a study treatment or by another medicine the participant was 
taking.  Sometimes the cause of a medical problem is unknown.  By comparing 
medical problems across many treatment groups in many studies, doctors try to 
understand what  effects a study medication might have on a participant.  
A total of  17 out of 20 (85%)  participants in this study had at least 1 medical problem.  
The most common medical problems – those reported by more than 1  participant  – 
are described below.   
Below are instructions on how to read Table 1.   
Instructions for Understanding Table  1.  
• The 1st column of Table 1  lists medical problems that were commonly 
reported during the study.  All medical problems reported by more than 
1 participant are listed.  
• The 2nd column tells how many of the 10 participants taking 
PF-06687234 plus infliximab reported each medical problem.  Next to 
this number is the percentage of the 10 participants taking PF -06687234 
plus infliximab who reported the medical problem.  
• The 3rd column tells how many of the 10 participants taking a placebo 
plus infliximab reported each medical problem.  Nex t to this number is 
the percentage of the 10 participants taking a placebo plus infliximab 
who reported the medical problem.  
• Using these instructions, you can see that none of the 10 participants 
taking PF-06687234 plus infliximab reported worsening  UC.  A total of  
3 out of the 10 (30%) participants taking a placebo reported worsening  
UC.

Headache  2 out of 10 participants (20%)  2 out of 10 participants (20%)  
There were 3  participants (15%, or 3 out of 20 participants) who left the study 
because of medical problems ; 1 in the PF -06687234 plus infl iximab group and 2 in the 
placebo plus infliximab group.  
Did study participants have any serious medical 
problems?  
A medical prob lem is considered “serious” when it is life -threatening, needs hospital 
care, or causes lasting problems.  
There was 1 participant  (5%, or  1 out of 20 partici pants ) who had a serious medical 
problem.  This was a serious  case of worsening  UC in a participant in the placebo plus  
infliximab group.  None of the participants in the PF -06687234 plus infliximab ha d 
serious medical problems.   
No participants died during the study.
