 
 1 CLINICAL TRIAL RESULTS  
 
This summary reports the results of only one study.  Researchers must look at the 
results of many types of studies to understand if a study medicine works, how it 
works, and if it is safe to prescribe to patients.  The results of this study might be 
differ ent than the results of other studies that the researchers review.

– Thank You – 
Pfizer, t he Sponsor , would like to thank you for your participation in this clinical trial 
and provide  you a summary of results representing everyone who participated.  If you

 2 WHY WAS THIS STUDY DONE?  
Rheumatoid arthritis, or “RA”, is a disease that causes swelling, pain, and stiffness in 
the joints.  RA is an “autoimmune disease”, which means that patients with RA have 
an overactive immune system that mistakenly attacks healthy parts of the body, such 
as the joints.  RA can cause permanent damage to the j oints if it goes un treated , so 
researchers are looking for new treatment options for RA.   
Patients in this study were treated with PF -06650833, which is an “investigational 
drug” .  This means it is not approved for use in people with RA  and is a new type of 
drug that is being studied for the treatment of RA .  Some of the patients in this study 
were also treated with tofacitinib.  This is a medicine that works to reduce the activity 
of the immune system in people with RA.  It is an oral  (taken by mouth) med ication 
that has been approved, and is available by prescription, to treat adults with active, 
moderate to severe RA that did not respond well to medications known as disease-
modifying anti -rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) like methotrexate.  
Researchers did this study to see if taking PF -06650833 helped with the symptoms of 
RA by reducing inflammation.    
WHAT HAPPENED DURING THE STUDY?  
This study compared 6  groups of patients to find out if PF -06650833 given at 
4 different doses works to treat RA compared to patients taking a “placebo ” or a 
comparator medicine  of tofacitinib (see Figure and Table ).  A placebo does not have 
any medicine in it, but looks just like the medicine.  T he patients and the doctors did 
not know who was given which treatment/ medicine and at what dose in this study .  
This is known as a “double -blinded”  study.  This was done to make sure that the trial 
results were not influenced in any way.  Volunteers were assigned to each group by 
chance alone.  This is known as a “randomized study”.  This is done to make the 
groups more similar, which makes comparing the groups more fair.

a All tablets were identical in appearance.  
 
The study included adult patients with moderate to severe active RA.  All the patients 
in this study were already taking methotrexate, but still had active RA symptoms.  In 
addition to methotrexate, the patient could have been previously treated with an anti -
tumor necrosis factor (anti -TNF).  This is a particular kind o f treatment that 
specifically “inhibits” the activity  of chemicals in the body known as TNFs.  Inhibits 
means that activity of a chemical is slowed down, reduced, or stopped. Anti- TNF 
treatment is used in RA to help control the disease and reduce pain and disability.  
The anti -TNF treatment could have been stopped because of safety concerns, if it did 
not seem to give sufficient help to the patient, or if the patient was not able to obtain 
the treatment due to access problems.  
In addition to study medicatio n (PF-06650833 plus placebo or tofacitinib plus 
placebo) , patients could take their normal treatments for RA  including methotrexate, 
non-steroidal anti- inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), cyclooxygenase (COX) -2 inhibitors, 
some types of opioid and/or acetaminophe n (paracetamol) for pain relief and/or a 
low dose of oral corticosteroids like prednisone.  
   
 5 While each patient  was only in the study for 20 weeks,  the entire study took 
21 months t o complete.  The Sponsor ran this study at 103  locations in 19  countries 
in Asia, Europe, Central  America, North America, and Oceania .  It began on 
10 November  2016 and ended on 15 August  2018.  59 men and 210  women 
participated.  All patients were between the ages of 19  and 73 years.  
Patients were to be treated for 12 weeks.  Of the  269 patients who started the study, 
237 finished the study (e.g., 12 weeks of treatment plus 4 weeks of follow up) .  During 
the follow -up period, patients were not given treatment but were only monitored for 
possible safety events.  There were 32  patients who left before the study was over by 
their choice or a doctor decided it was best for a patient to stop the study.  Of these 
32 patients, 27 patients did not complete the 12 weeks of treatment and 5 patients 
completed the 12 weeks o f treatment , but did not completed the 4 weeks of follow -
up.   
When the study ended in August 2018,  the Sponsor began reviewing the infor mation 
collected.  The S ponsor then cr eated a report of the results.  This is a summary of that 
report.   
WHAT WERE THE RESULTS OF THE STUDY?  
Did 12 weeks of treatment with PF-06650833 reduce RA 
activity ?  
RA activity was measured using a “simplified disease activity index”, which gives a 
score for disease activity.  This score is based on the number of swollen and tender 
joints as well as how the patient feels about their RA, what the patient’s doctor thinks 
about the patient’s RA , and the amount of a substance known as “ C-reactive protein”, 
or CRP , which  can be found in a patient’s blood .  CRP is made by the liver if there is 
an “inflammatory response”.  An inflammatory response is the body’s reaction to an infection  or something the body thinks is foreign.  A negative score at Week 12  in the 
simplified disease activity index  compared with “baseline ”, or the score the patient 
had just before the  start of t reatment in this study,  means the patient  and their doctor 
thinks that their RA activity has been reduced.   
 6 After 12 w eeks of treatment, RA activity was reduced in patients who took   
PF-0665083 3 compar ed with patients taking placebo.  The average reduction  in RA 
activity with PF -066508 33 depended on the dose  given, but the score was between 22 
and 25 for PF -066508 33 compared with a score of 14 for placebo.  Based on these 
results, the researchers hav e decided that the results are not likely a result of chance.  
Note:  T his study was specifically  set up to look at the  RA activity after PF -06650833 
treatment compared with p lacebo .  Therefore RA activity after tofacitinib treatment 
was not included in the  graph  below . 
 
This does not mean that everyone in this study had these results.  Other studies may 
produce  different results , as well .  These are just some of the main findings of the 
study, and more information may be available at the websites listed at  the end of this 
summary.    
 
 7 WHAT MEDICAL PROBLEMS DID PATIENTS  
HAVE DURING THE STUDY?  
The researchers recorded any medical problems the pa rticipant s had during the study. 
Participant s could have had medical problems for reasons not related to the study (fo r 
example, caused by an underlying disease or by chance).  Or, medical problems could 
also have been caused by a study treatment, or by another medicine  the participan t 
was taking.  Sometimes the cause of a medical problem is unknown.  By comparing 
medical  problems across many treatment groups in many studies, doctors try to 
understand what the side effects of an experimental drug might be.  
123 out of 269  patients in this study had at least 1 medical problem .  A total of 
12 patients (5%, 12 out of 269 patients) left the study because of medical problems.  
There were 20 patients (7%, 20 out of 269 patients) who stop ped taking the study 
treatment  for a short period of time or who had their dose of  study treatment  reduced 
during this study .  The most common med ical problems are listed below.

 9 WERE THERE ANY SERIOUS MEDICAL 
PROBLEMS?  
A medical problem  is considered “serious” when it is life- threatening, needs hospital 
care, or causes lasting problems .   
8 patients ( 3%, or 8 out of 269  patients ) had serious medical problems:  6 patients in 
the PF-06650833  group s, 1 patient in the tofacitinib group, and 1 patient  in the 
placebo group.  The doctors thought that 1 serious medical problem was related to 
study tr eatment.  This was a report of serious liver injury by a patient in the  
PF-06650833 20 mg group .  All of t he other serious medical problems were reported 
by 1 patient each and none were thought by the doctor s to be linked with study 
treatment.  No patient s died during the study.
