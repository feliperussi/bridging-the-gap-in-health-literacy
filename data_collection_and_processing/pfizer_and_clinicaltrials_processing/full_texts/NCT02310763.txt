2WHY WAS THIS STUDY DONE ?
Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a disease that damage smuscles, causing 
muscle weakness and loss of the ability to walk.  DMD is most common in boys.   
Domagrozumab isan experimental medicine studied for DMD.  Domagrozumab has 
not been approved for use outside of research studies.
The main goal of this study was to learn more about the use of domagrozumab in 
boys with DMD. Researchers wanted to answer thesequestion s: 
What medical problems did boys have during the study?
Did boys who received domagrozumab have an improvement in functioning 
after 49 weeks of treatment, compared to boys who received placebo?
A placebo looks just like the medicine, but doesn’t have any medicine in it.
To see if boys had an improvement in fun ctioning, researchers used a test called the 
“4 Stair Climb”.  The ymeasured how long it took the boys to go up stairs and then 
compared the results between the boys who received domagrozumab and those who 
received placebo .
WHAT HAPPENED DURING THE STUDY?
This study compared boys taking domagrozumab or placebo .The study included boys 
with DMD who were able to walk, and were at least 6 but younger than 16 years old 
when the study began. 
First, boys were screened by the study doctor s.  Certain tests were done to make sure 
theboys were a good fit to join the study.  
Next, boys were assigned to 1 of 3 treatment groups.  Boys were assigned to each 
group by chance alone.  Putting boys into groups by chance helps make the groups 
more even to compare.   The study was done in 2 parts, so that each boywould 
receive domagrozumab during part of the study.   Each part lasted about 48 weeks.   
The boys, their parents, and the researchers did not know who took domagrozumab

3and who took the placebo.  This is kno wn as a “blinded” study.  Boys were assigned 
to each group by chance alone.
Group 1: 41Boys
Part 1: Domagrozumab starting at 5 milligrams per kilogram of weight 
(mg/kg), then increased to 20 mg/kg, then to 40 mg/kg
Part 2: D omagrozumab 40 mg/kg
Group 2: 39Boys
Part 1: Domagrozumab starting at 5 mg/kg, then increased to 20 mg/kg, then 
to 40 mg/kg
Part 2: Placebo
Group 3: 40Boys
Part 1: Placebo
Part 2: Domagrozumab starting at 5 mg/kg, then increased to 20 mg/kg, then 
to 40 mg/kg
All study drugs were given as an IV infusion, which means that a needle is placed in 
the vein and the study drug slowly drips into the vein.
When they came to study visits, boys were asked to complete questionnaires about 
their DMD symptoms and do tests, like the 4 Stair Climb test.
Finally, boys were asked to participate in 2 follow -up visits after they stopped study 
treatment.  
The figure on the following page shows what happened during this study.

4While boys were in the study for less than 2 years , the entire study took about 4years
to complete.  The sponsor ran this study at 35locations in Australia, Bulgaria, Canada, 
Italy, Japan, Poland, United Kingdom, and United States. It began 24November 
2014 and ended 23November 2018.  All 120 participants were boys between t he ages 
of 6 and 15.
Boys were to complete Part 1 and Part 2 of the study, and participate in 2 follow -up 
visits. Of the 120 boys who entered the study and received study treatment , 65boys
(54%) completed it.  55boys (46%) did not complete the study by their choice or 
because a doctor decided it was best for a boyto stop the study, or because the
Sponsor decided to stop the study early.
The Sponsor decided to stop the study early in November 2018, because results did 
not show that boys benefited fro m taking domagrozumab .After the study ended, the 
Sponsor then created a report of the results.  This is a summary of that report.
WHAT WERE THE RESULTS OF THE STUDY?
Did boys who received domagrozumab have an 
improvement in functioning after 49 weeks of treatment , 
compared to boys who received placebo ?
To answer this question, the researchers looked at the results of the 4 Stair Climb test 
from before boys started study treatment, and after they had received study treatment 
for 49 weeks.  The researchers looked to see if there were differences in the test 
results between the boys receiving domagrozumab versus the boys receiving placebo .

5After 49 weeks of treatment, the change in the 4 Stair Climb test was about the same 
for boys who received domagrozumab and boys who received placebo.  In other 
words , this study did not show that boys who received d omagrozumab had an 
improvement in functioning, compared to boys who received placebo.
The figure below shows the change in results of the 4 Stair Climb test over 49 weeks, 
for boys who received d omagrozumab versus boys who received placebo.
This does not mean that everyone in this study had these results.  These are just some 
of the main findings of the study, and more information may be available at the 
websites listed at the end of this summary.   
WHAT MEDICAL PROBLEMS DID BOYS HAVE 
DURING THE STUDY ?
The researchers recorded any medical problems the boys had during the study. Boys
could have had medical problems for reasons not related to the study (for example, 
caused by an underlying disease or by chance). Or, medical problems could also have 
been caused by a study treatment, or by another medicine the boywas taking. 
Sometimes the cause of a medical problem is unknown. By comparing medical 
problems across many treatment groups in many studies, doctors try to understand 
what the side effects of an experimental drug might be.

WERE THERE ANY SERIOUS MEDICAL 
PROBLEMS ?
A medical problem is considered “serious” when it is life -threatening, needs hospital 
care, or causes lasting problems .  
During Part 1, 2 out of 120 boys (2%) had serious medical problems .  During Part 2, 
3 out of 113 boys (3%) had serious medical problems.  All boys who had serious 
medical problems received domagrozumab during the study. No boys died during 
this study.   During the extension study that followed this study, 1 boy passed away for 
a reason not related to taking domagrozumab.
