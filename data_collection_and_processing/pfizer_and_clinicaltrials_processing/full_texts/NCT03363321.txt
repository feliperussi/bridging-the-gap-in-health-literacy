1Clinical Trial Results
This summary reports the results of only one study.  Researchers must look at the results 
of many types of studies to understand if a study medicine works, how it works, and if 
it is safe to prescribe to participants .  The results of this study might be di fferent than 
the results of other studies that the researchers review.

2Why was this study done?
Hemophilia is a disease that is “inherited”, which means it runs in families, and while 
girls and women can have it too, it mainly affects boys and men.  People with 
hemophilia have problems with their blood not clotting.  After an injury, someone 
with hemophilia will bruise more easily and, if cut, will bleed for longer , but not faster .  
Sometimes bleeding can happen inside the body and this “intern al bleeding” can lead 
to serious problems.
People with hemophilia have low amounts of one of two proteins called factor VIII 
and factor IX.  When that protein that is essential to clotting is either missing or 
doesn’t work properly, they are diagnosed with hemophilia.  People with low factor 
VIII have hemophilia A ,while p eople with low factor IX have hemophilia B.  
Doctors prescribe medicines called “factor replacement therapy” to help the blood 
clot in people with hemophilia.  These treatments work by rep lacing clotting factors 
VIII or IX.  People with hemophilia A have the option of using Hemlibra, which is 
treatment for factor VIII replacement.  Some people cannot be treated with factor 
replacement therapy for long amounts of time as the body can develop “inhibitors” 
that stop the treatment from working.  Thus other types of treatments are needed to 
help people with hemophilia. 
Another way hemophilia may be treated is to stop the protein called “tissue factor 
pathway inhibitor” (TFPI).  TFPI acts like a br akeand slow s the clotting of blood.  
Marstacimab (PF -06741086) is anew type of treatment known as a monoclonal 
antibody.  Monoclonal antibodies are copie s of certain proteins found in the body that 
can help treat different conditions.  Marstacimab works by attaching to TFPI, which 
removes the brake and lets the blood clot in people with hemophilia A and B with or 
without inhibitors .  
Marstacimab is given as a subcutaneous injection with a needle just underneath the 
skin.  The medicine eventually enters the bloodstream and is carried around the body 
where it may help to prevent or reduce the number of bleeding episodes.
The purpose of this study was to lear n more about the safety of Marstacimab at 
different doses in participants with severe hemophilia.

3What happened during the study? 
This study evaluated two groups of participants given weekly injections of 
Marstacimab at different doses.  This was done to see if participants had any medical 
problems while taking Marstacimab and to see if this treatment could prevent 
bleeding episodes.  
The study was open to male participants , between 18 and 75 years old, with a 
diagnosis of severe hemophilia type A or B, with or without inhibitors.  Twenty (20) 
participants enrolled in the study :18 of these participants had participated in a 
previous Marstacimab study (B7841002) and the other 2 participa nts, both without 
inhibitors, were taking Marstacimab for the first time .
This was an open -label study, so everyone, including the participants , knew what 
treatment was given to each group.
While participants were only in the study for 1 year, the entir e study took 26 months 
to complete.  The Sponsor ran this study at 11 locations in 9 countries in Africa, 
Europe, North America and South America.  It began 30 May 2018 and ended 
05August 2020.  Twenty (20) men and no women participated.  All participants were 
between the ages of 19 and 57 years old. 
Participants were to be treated until the end of their 1 year study period.  Of the 
20participants who started the study, 18finished the study.  Two (2) participants left 
before the study was over by their choice or a doctor decided it was best for a 
participant to stop being in the study.

4When the study ended in August 2020, the Sponsor began reviewing the information 
collected.  The Sponsor then created a report of the results.  This is a summary of that 
report.
What were the results of the study?
Did participants taking Marstacimab have any medical problems? 
To learn more about safety, the study doctors did a number of tests and exams, 
including lab tests, heart tr acings, physical exams, vital signs (blood pressure, 
breathing rate, temperature, and heart rate) and heart -related medical problems.  
There were no meaningful changes found on these tests.
Researchers also collected information on the number of bleeding e vents each 
participant had during the study.  On average, participants had less frequent bleeding 
over the course of the year with Marstacimab treatment.

5This does not mean that everyone in this study had these results.  Other studies may 
produce different results, as well.  These are just some of the main findings of the 
study, and more information may be available at the websites listed at the end of this
summary.  
What medical problems did participants have during 
the study?
The researchers recorded any medical problems the participants had during the study.  
Participants could have had medical problems for reasons not related to the study (for 
example, caused by an underlying disease or by chance).  Or, medical problems could 
also have been caused by a study treatment or by another medicine the participant was 
taking.  Sometimes the cause of a medical problem is unknown.  By comparing 
medical problems ac ross many treatment groups in many studies, doctors try to 
understand what the side effects of an experimental drug might be.
Fourteen (14) out of 20 participants in this study had at least 1 medical problem.  No 
participants left the study because of medi cal problems.  The most common medical 
problems are listed below.

6Were there any serious medical problems?
A medical problem is considered “serious” when it is life -threatening, needs hospital 
care, or causes lasting problems.  
No participants died during the study .One (1) participant in the 300 mg Marstacimab 
group had2serious medical problems : bleeding in the brain and seizure. The 
researchers did not consider these events to be related to the study drug .

medici nes can work and are safe for participants .
Again, thank  you for volunteering.
We do research to try to find the 
best ways to help participants , and you 
helped us to do that!
