 2 WHY WAS THIS STUDY DONE?  
Cloistridioides difficile (previously Clostridium diff icile) is a germ  or bacteria that  can be  
found in the bowel  of some people .  This germ i s also known a s C. difficile  or C. diff .  
Sometimes when people take “antibiotics”  to treat an illness , the C. difficile  that is in 
their bowel can multiply.  This is because antibiotics kill both good and bad bacteria 
and killing the good bacteria gives the C. difficile  room to spread .  C. difficile  infections 
are often  seen in people who have a weakened “immune system” because of other 
illnesses or due to old age.   The immune system is what defends the body from germs 
like C. difficile .   
When someone has a C. difficile  infection they will usually have diarrhea or loose  
stools .  This is because when C. difficile  multiples in the bowel, it can produce “toxins”.  
A toxin is a substance made by a living cell that is harmful to the body.  C. difficile  
makes 2  different toxins and these are called A and B.  These toxins damage the 
bowel and this is what makes people i ll.  Doctors will prescribe antibiotics to try to get 
rid of C.  difficile .  For  some people, the antibiotics may not work and  a different 
antibiotic may need to be given .  Sometimes these antibiotics may not work and the 
C. diff icile cannot be got ten rid of easily and other treatment options are needed .  If the 
infection cannot be treated, th e diarrhea can get worse , and the person could be come 
very ill and may die. 
Researchers did this study to see if the  C. difficile  vaccine could help the body’s 
immune system  produce “antibodies”  against the toxins made by C. difficile .  
Antibodies are special proteins made by the body that can recognize and help kill 
germs  or toxins .  Antibodies can p rotect people f rom getting sick if they come into 
contact with a germ or toxin that the body recognizes .  The  researchers conducting 
this study w anted  to see if the C. difficile  vaccine was safe  and if antibodies could be 
made against the modified C. difficile  toxins in the vaccine .   
WHAT HAPPENED DURING THE STUDY?  
This study compared 6 groups of participants  to find out if people  given an injection 
of 2 different doses of the C. difficile  vaccine  at different times reacted differently 
compared to people given placebo (see Table) .  In this study, the C. difficile  vaccine 
was given at a dose of 100 micrograms  or 200  micrograms , and the placebo was 
“saline”  (also known as salt water ).  A placebo does not have any medicine in it, but  
looks similar to the medicine.  Researchers use a placebo to see if the medicine the y 
are testing work ed better or wa s safer compared with placebo .  The  injections were 
given on Day 1, Day  8, and Day  30 in the Day Group or on Day 1, Month 1 , and  
 3 Month  6 in the Month Group.   Day 1 wa s the day that the first injection was given  for 
both groups .   
Description of Treatment Groups  
Group  Dose  Timing of the Injections 
1 C. difficile  vaccine  100 micrograms  Day Group : Injection s were given 
on Day 1, Day  8, and Day 30  2 C. difficile  vaccine 200 micrograms  
3 Placebo  
4 C. difficile  vaccine 100 micrograms  Month Group : Injection s were 
given on Day 1, Month 1, and 
Month  6 5 C. difficile  vaccine 200 micrograms  
6 Placebo  
The study included participants who were healthy and 65 to 85  years  of age.   The 
participants and most of the researchers did not know who received  an injection of 
the C. difficile  vaccine  and who received  placebo.  This is known as a “blinded” study.  
The only person who knew what injection a participant was given was the person who 
gave th e injection.  Volunteers were assigned to each group by chance alone.  
Participant s were put into 1 of the 6 treatment groups as shown in the table  above .  
This is known as a “randomized” study.  This is done to make the groups similar, 
which then makes com paring the results between the groups  more  fair.   
At the end of the original study, participants  who received all 3 doses of the C. difficile  
vaccine were able to enter an “ extension ” study and receive a fo urth dose of vaccine 
or placebo .  This new study continued  after the original study ended.   
While participants were only in the original study for 18 months if given the C. difficile  
vaccine in the Month Group or 13 months if given the C. difficile  vaccine in the Day 
Group, the original study took almos t 20 months to complete.  The sponsor ran this 
study at 15 locations in the United States.  It began on 16  July 2015 and ended on 
07 March  2017.  A total of 393 men and 461 women participated.  All participants 
were between the ages of 65  and 85 years.   
Of the 854 participants who started the study, 787 received all 3 doses of C. difficile  
vaccine or placebo and 740 finished the original study.  In the Month G roup, 
427 participant s (200 men and 227 women) received at least 1 dose, 
412 (97%)  received at least 2 doses, and 383  (90%) received all 3 doses.  In the 
Day Group , 427 participant s (193 men and 234 women) received at least 1  dose, 
417 (97%) received at least 2  doses, and 404 (94%) received all 3 doses.  A total of 
114 participants left before the stu dy was over by their choice or a doctor decided it 
was best for the participant to stop the study.

As of 21  June 2017 (the data cutoff date for the original study), the Sponsor began 
reviewing infor mation collected .  The Sponsor then cr eated a report of the results.  
This is a summary of that report.  
 
 5 WHAT WERE THE RESULTS OF THE STUDY?  
Were participants able to make antibodies when given  the 
C. difficile  vaccine ?  
The C. difficile  vaccine contains 2 different types of protein that participant s could 
make antibodies against .  These proteins,  A and B, are like the toxins produced by 
C. difficile  that make people ill .  The proteins in the vaccine have been changed so that 
they are not poisonous  and won’t make people sick .  The research ers looked to see if 
participant s had antibodies against A, against B , or against A and B  in their blood 
after the y had received all 3 doses .  If the participants had antibodies against A, B, or 
A + B, then the immune system may have been able to recognize the A toxin , the B 
toxin, or both the A and B toxins.  If the immune system c ould recognize these toxins 
then the body m ight have been able to get rid of the toxins before they d id any harm .  
If antibodies against A, B or A + B we re prese nt in participants who were given 
placebo then this means the participant may have been exposed previously to 
C. difficile  bacteria,  possibly without ever kno wing.  
At Month 7 , 1 month after the third dose of vaccine in participant s in the Month 
Group , 160 out of 163  participants (98%)  given the 100 microgram s dose and 151 out 
of 158  participants (96%) given t he 200 microgram s dose had antibodies against A 
compared with 1 out of 53  participants (2%) given placebo .  Antibodies against B 
were found in 122  out of 163 participants (75%) given the  100 microgram s dose and 
in 138 out of 158 participants (87%) given the 200 microgram s dose compared with 
4 out of 53 participants (8%) given placebo .  Antibodies against A + B were found in 
121 out of 163 participants (74%) given the 100 microgram s dose and in 136 out of 
158 participant s (86%) given the 200 microgram s dose compared with none of the 
53 participants given placebo . 
At Day 37 , 7 days after the third dose of vaccine in participants in the Day Group, 
117 out of 171 participants (68%) given the 100 microgram s dose and 141 out of 
165 participant s (86%)  given the 200 microgram s dose had antibodies against  A 
compared with 7 out of 56 participants (13%) given placebo .  Antibodies against B 
were seen in 51  out of 1 71 participant s (30%) given the 100 microgram s dose and in 
64 out of 1 65 participant s (39%)  given the 200  microgram s dose compared with 1  out 
of 56 participants (2%) given placebo .  Antibodies against A + B were seen in 45  out 
of 171 participant s (26%) given the 100 microgram s dose and in 64 out of 
165 participant s (39%) given the 200 microgram s dose compared with none of the 
56 participants given placebo .   
 6  
Based on these results, the researchers decided that the results were  not due to  
chance .  C. difficile vaccine given at a dose of either 100 micrograms  or 
200 micrograms  in the Month Group or in the Day Group may have helped  people  
65 to 85 years of age develop antibodies against the  modified toxins within the 
C. difficile  vaccine .  This vaccine may be an option for people 65 to 85 years of age 
who could become very ill because of C. difficile .

 7 This does not mean that everyone in th is study had these results .  Other studies may 
produce  different results, as well .  These are just some of the main findings of the 
study, and more information may be available at the websites listed at the end of this 
summary.    
Did participants who were given the C. difficile  vaccine have 
any reactions to the vaccine?  
The researchers looked at whether there were any “local” reactions to the vaccine.  A local reaction is something that is seen at the site where the injection  of the vaccine 
was given  and can include pain at the injection site, redness , and/or swelling.  
Participants were asked to record details of any local reactions they had in a  study  
diary they were given.  In the Month Group, t his information was collected for 
14 days after each dose o f vaccine. Participants in the Day Group were also asked to 
record this information, but this was for 7 days after dose 1 and for 14 days after dose 2 and dose  3. 
In participants in the Month Group, local reactions were seen in 21% to 29% of participants g iven the C. difficile  vaccine compared with 2% to 8% given placebo.  In 
participants in the Day Group, local reactions were seen in 16% to 45% of participants given the C. difficile  vaccine compared with 2% to 7% given placebo.  
Local reactions seen after the C. difficile  vaccine were similar to the reactions seen 
when people are given other adult vaccines.

Dose 3  43/175 (25%)  42/171 (25%)  2/57 (4%)  
The researchers also looked at whether there were any “systemic events” or reactions 
to the vaccine.  Systemic  means something that affects the whole body or specific 
parts of it like the head or joints.  S ystemic events were reactions that participants may  
have had after they had been given the vaccine, like feeling tired, muscle pain, 
headache, loose stools, high temperature , and/or being sick.  Participants were asked 
to record details of any systemic events in their study diary.  In the Month Group, t his 
information was collected for 14 days after each dose of vaccine.  Participants in the 
Day Group were also asked to record this information, but this was for 7 days after dose 1 and for 14 days after dose 2 and dose  3.   
In participants in the Month Gr oup, systemic events were seen in 31% to 50% of 
participants given the C. difficile  vaccine compared with 30% to 53 % given placebo.  In 
participants in the Day Group, systemic events were seen in 18% to 37% of 
participants given the C. difficile  vaccine co mpared with 25% to 31 % given  placebo.   
The systemic events reported after the C. difficile  vaccine were similar to the systemic 
events seen when people are given other adult vaccines .

WHAT  MEDICAL PROBLEMS DID 
PARTICIPANT S HAVE DURING THE STUDY ? 
The researchers recorded any medical problems the participants  had during the study.   
Participants could have had medical problems for reasons not related to the study (for 
example, caused by an underlying disease or by chance).  Or, medical problems could 
also have been caused by a study treatment, or by another medicine  the participant  
was taking.  Sometimes the cause of a medical problem is unknown.  By comparing 
medical problems across many treatment groups in many studies, doctors try to 
understand what the side effects of an experimental drug or vaccine might be.  
In participants given the C. diffic ile vaccine or placebo in the Month Group , 84%  or 
154 out of 183 participants in the 100 micrograms  dose group  and 84% or 153 out of 
183 participants in the 200 micrograms dose group had non-serious medical problems 
compared with 85% or 52 out of 61 participants in the placebo  group .  There were 
very few non -serious medical problems that were reported by 2 or more participants.  
Most of these non -serious medical problems were each reported by 1 or 
2 participants . In participants given the C. difficil e vaccine or placebo in the Day 
Group , 67% or 1 22 out of 182 participants in the 100 micrograms  dose group and 
75% or 1 38 out of 1 84 participants in the 200 micrograms  dose group had non-
serious medical problems compared with 62% or 38 out of 61 participan ts in the 
placebo  group .  There were very few non -serious medical problems that were 
reported by 2 or more participants.   
   
 10 Most of these non -serious medical problems were each reported by 1 or 
2 participants .  A total of 16 participants left the study because of medical problems 
that the doctors thought were unrelated to the vaccine .   
WERE THERE ANY SERIOUS MEDICAL 
PROBLEMS ? 
A medical problem  is considered “serious” when it is life -threatening, needs hospital 
care, or causes lasting problems.   
In the Month Group, 43 pa rticipant s (10%, or 43 out of 427 pa rticipants ) had serious 
medical problems.  This included 19 participants (10%, or 19 out of 183 participants) 
in the C.  difficile  vaccine 100  micrograms  dose group, 22 participants (12%, or 22 out 
of 183  participants) in the C. difficile  200 micrograms  dose group, and 2 participants 
(3%, or 2 out of 61  participants)  in the placebo group . In the Day Group, 
17 participants (4%, or 17 out of 427  participants) had serious medical problems.  
This included 11  participants (6%, or 11 out of 182 participants) in the C.  difficile  
vaccine 100  micrograms  dose group and 6  participants (3%, or 6 out of 
184 participants) in the C. difficile  200 micrograms  dose group. None of the 
61 participants in the placebo group had serious medical problems .  
Overall, 5 out of the 854 participants died during the study (1%, or 5 out of 
854 participants ), with 2  deaths in  participants in the Month Group and 3 deaths in 
participants in the Da y Group .  After review by the researchers, there were no serious 
medical problems or deaths that were thought to be  related to  the vaccine.
