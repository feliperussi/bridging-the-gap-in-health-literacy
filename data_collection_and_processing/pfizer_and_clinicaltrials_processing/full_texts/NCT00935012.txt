1CLINICAL TRIAL RESULTS
This summary reports the results of only one study.  Researchers must look at the 
results of many types of studies to understand if a study medicine works, how it 
works, and if it is safe to prescribe to patients.  The results of this study might be 
differ ent than the results of other studies that the researchers review.

2WHY WAS THIS STUDY DONE?
Transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy is a type of heart disease that is caused by a 
certain kind of protein building up in the heart muscle.  This protein is called 
transthyretin, or “TTR”.  TTR is normally made by your liver and carries things like 
hormones and Vitamin A throughout your body.  In patients with transthyretin 
amyloid cardiomyopathy, TTR breaks apart and clumps together i n fibers called 
“amyloid”.  These amyloid fibers build up in the heart muscle and cause it to become 
stiff, eventually resulting in heart failure.  Researchers are looking for new treatments 
that can help patients with transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy live longer. 
Tafamidis meglumine (also known as Vyndaqel®and another form of tafamidis, 
Vyndamax®) is a drug that is now approved in the United States and other countries 
to treat transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy.  Tafamidis was still an investigatio nal 
drug when this study began.  Tafamidis works by keeping TTR from breaking apart 
and forming into amyloid fibers.  Researchers think that this slows down the buildup 
of amyloid fibers in the heart muscle, which helps slow down the rate at which the 
heart disease gets worse over time.
This study was an extension of the Study Fx1B -201, which treated transthyretin 
amyloid cardiomyopathy patients with tafamidis for 12 months.  The main purpose of 
the current study was to measure how safe tafamidis treatment is over a longer period 
of time.  Another purpose of this study was to give patients who took part in 
Study Fx1B -201 access to tafamidis treatment for up to 10 additional years.  To 
measure the safety of long -term tafamidis treatment, the researchers in th is study 
asked:
What medical problems and serious medical problems did patients have 
while taking tafamidis?
How long did patients live while taking tafamidis?

3WHAT HAPPENED DURING THE STUDY?
This study followed 31 patients for up to 10 years to see what medical problems they 
had while taking tafamidis.  This was an open -label study, which means that the 
patients and researchers knew that the patients were taking tafamidis.  All patients 
took 2 0mg of tafamidis by mouth once daily.  
The study included men and women with transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy who 
had completed Study Fx1B -201 and had not received a heart or liver transplant.  A 
diagram of the study is shown below.
Patients could have been in the study for up to 10 years.  The entire study took 
10years and 2 months to complete.  The Sponsor ran this study at 5 locations in the 
United States.  It began on 22 September 2009 and ended on 20 November 2019.  
Twenty -eight (28) men and 3 women participated.  All patients were between the ages 
of 69 and 88.

4Patients were to be treated until the end of the study, or until the patient withdrew 
from the study or passed away.  Of the 31 patients who started the study, 2 finished 
10 years of study treatment.  Twenty -nine (29) patients did not finish the study.  
Nineteen (19) patients did not finish the study because they passed away.  
Eight (8)patients left before the study was over by their choice, and 2 patients left 
because a doctor decid ed it was best for a patient to stop being in the study.
When the study ended in November 2019, the Sponsor began reviewing the 
information collected.  The Sponsor then created a report of the results.  This is a 
summary of that report.

5WHAT WERE THE RES ULTS OF THE STUDY?
What medical problems did patients have while taking tafamidis?
The researchers recorded any medical problems the participants had during the study.  
Participants could have had medical problems for reasons not related to the study (for 
example, caused by an underlying disease or by chance).  Or, medical problems could 
also have been caused by a study treatment or by another medicine the participant was 
taking.  Sometimes the cause of a medical problem is unknown.  By comparing 
medical pr oblems across many treatment groups in many studies, doctors try to 
understand what the side effects of an experimental drug might be.
All 31 patients in this study had at least 1 medical problem.  A total of 2 patients 
stopped taking tafamidis because of medical problems and did not start again.  The 
most common medical problems are listed below.

6What serious medical problems did patients have while taking 
tafam idis?
A medical problem is considered “serious” when it is life -threatening, needs hospital 
care, or causes lasting problems.  Twenty -nine (29) patients (94%, or 29 out of 
31patients) had serious medical problems.  The researchers in this study think that 
most of the serious medical problems were not related to taking tafamidis.  
Four (4)serious medical problems were reported for 3 patients that may have been 
related to taking tafamidis (1 patient had a blood clot in the lung, 1 patient reported 
feeling faint, and 1 patient had an irregular heart rhythm and kidney failure).  A total 
of 23patients passed away during this study, mostly due to heart -related medical 
problems.  The most common serious medical problems are listed below.

7How long did patients live while taking tafamidis?
To answer this question, the researchers measured how long patients lived while 
taking tafamidis before they passed away.  They calculated the ‘median’ time lived, 
which is the time point when half (50%) o f the patients in the study were still alive 
and half had passed away for any reason (such as a medical problem or an accident).  
For patients who passed away for any reason during the study, the median amount of 
time they lived was 4 years.
The researcher s also looked at the patients who passed away from heart -related 
medical problems and calculated how long they had lived.  For patients who passed 
away from heart -related medical problems during the study, the median amount of 
time they lived was 6 years. 
Because all patients in this study took tafamidis, this study was not intended to show 
that one treatment was better than another.  Tafamidis is now an option for treating 
patients with transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy.
This does not mean that everyone in this study had these results.  Other studies may 
produce different results.  These are just some of the main findings of the study, and 
more information may be available at the websites listed at the end of this summary.
