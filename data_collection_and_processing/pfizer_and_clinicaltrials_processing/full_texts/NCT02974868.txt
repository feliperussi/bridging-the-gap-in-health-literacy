CLINICAL TRIAL RESULTS
This summary reports the results of only one study.  Researchers must look at the 
results of many types of studies to understand if a study medicine works, how it 
works, and if it is safe to prescribe to patients.  The results of this study might be 
different than the results of other studies that the researchers review.

2WHY WAS THIS STUDY DONE?
Alopecia areata (AA) is an autoimmune skin disease that causes hair loss ranging from 
small patches to a loss of all hair on the head and body.  AA occurs when the immune 
system mistakes normal cells in the body as foreign invaders and attacks these cells.  
There is no cure for AA and most countries do not have an approved treatment for 
AA.  Treatments that reduce the ac tivity of parts of the immune system are often used 
to treat AA, but some of these treatments can cause other health problems or can 
only be used for short periods of time.  Researchers are looking for new treatments 
for AA that can be taken safely for lon gerperiods of time.
Two (2)drugs were tested in this study: PF -06651600 and PF -06700841.  
PF-06651600 and PF -06700841 are both experimental drugs that have not been 
approved for sale yet.  PF -06651600 blocks the activity of protein scalled “Janus 
kinase 3” and the “TEC family kinase s”.PF-06700841 blocks the activity of 2other 
enzymes called “Janus kinase 1” and “Tyrosine -protein kinase 2”.  These enzymes act 
like on/off switches for the cells of the immune system.  By turning off these 
switches, the ce lls of the immune system are expected to produce fewer cytokines, a 
different type of protein, that are believed to make AA worse.  
The researchers wanted to know,
Were patients who took PF-06651600 or PF -06700841 more likely to have 
their AA improve compared to patients who were treated with a placebo?
To do this, researchers measured the severity of each patient’s AA at the beginning of 
the study.  The researchers measured the severity o f AA after 24 weeks of treatment.  
The difference in severity was used to decide if a patient’s AA had improved or not. 
WHAT HAPPENED DURING THE STUDY?
This study compared 3 groups of patients to find out if patients taking PF -06651600 
or PF -06700841 had their AA improved compared to patients taking placebo.  A 
placebo does not have any medicine in it, but looks just like the medicine.

3The study included adult men and women who were aged 18 to 75 years.  Patients 
included in the study had moderate to seve re AA with: 
At least 50% hair loss on the scalp and no hair growing back within 6 
months Current episode of h air loss started lessthan 7 years ago .The patients 
and researchers did not know who took PF -06651600, who took PF -06700841 
and who took the placebo.  This was done to make sure that the trial results 
were not influenced in any way.  This is known as a “double -blinded” study.  
Patients were put into 1 of3 treatment groups by chance alone (like the flip of 
a coin or dr awing straws) to receive either PF -06651600, PF -06700841, or 
placebo.  Patients had a 33% (1 in3) chance of receiving PF -06651600, a 33% 
(1in3) chance of receiving PF -06700841, and a 33% (1 in3) chance of 
receiving placebo in the initial 24 weeks of th e treatment period.  This is known 
as a “randomized” study.  This is done to make the groups more similar.  
Reducing differences between the groups (like age or the number of men and 
women), makes the groups more even to compare.

4While patients were only in the study for 24 weeks forthe first part of the study , the 
entire study took 29 months to complete.  The Sponsor ran this study at 55 locations 
in 3 countries in Australia and North America.  It began 15 December 2016 and 
ended 15 May 2019.  Forty -four ( 44)men and 98 women participated.  All patients 
were between the ages of 18 and 68 years old.
Patients were to be treated until the end of week 24.  Of the 142 patients who started 
the study, 114 finished the initial 24 -week tre atment period.  8 patients did not finish 
the initial 24 -week treatment period because of medical problems.  Twenty ( 20)
patients stopped taking the study medication by their choice or a doctor decided it 
was best for a patient to stop being in the study.

5When the study ended in May 2019, the Sponsor began reviewing the information 
collected.  The Sponsor then created a report of the results.  This is a summary of that 
report.
WHAT WERE THE RESULTS OF THE STUDY?
Were patients who took PF -06651600 or PF -06700841 more 
likely to have their AA improve compared to patients who are 
treated with a placebo?
In this study, change in AA severity was measured using the Severity of Alopecia Tool 
(SALT) Score.  This score is based on how much of the hair on the scalp is missing.  
Researchers recorded how much hair patients were missing at the end of the study 
compared with how much they had right before the study.  The amount of hair 
patients entered the study with was called the “baseline” .
At the end of the 24 -week tre atment period, more patients both in the PF -06651600 
and PF -06700841 treatment groups had their AA improved compared to patients in 
the placebo group. 
When the change in severity of AA was measured using the Severity of Alopecia Tool 
(SALT) Score, patient s in the PF -06651600 treatment group had an average 
improvement of 33% from baseline, patients in the PF -06700841 treatment group had 
an average improvement of 51% from baseline, and patients in the placebo group had 
an average improvement of 1% from basel ine.

6Based on these results, the researchers have decided that the results are not likely the 
result of chance.  The test medicine may be an option for treating patient population 
with AA. 
This does not mean that everyone in this study had these results.  Other studies may 
produce different results, as well.  These are just some of the main findings of the 
study, and more information may be available at the websites listed at the end of this
summary.

7WHAT MEDICAL PROBLEMS DID 
PARTICIPANTS HAVE DURING THE STUDY?
The researchers recorded any medical problems the participants had during the study.  
Participants could have had medical problems for reasons not related to the study (for 
example , caused by an underlying disease or by chance).  Or, medical problems could 
also have been caused by a study treatment or by another medicine the participant was 
taking.  Sometimes the cause of a medical problem is unknown.  By comparing 
medical problems across many treatment groups in many studies, doctors try to 
understand what the side effects of an experimental drug might be.
One-hundred three (103) out of 142 patients in this study had at least 1 medical 
problem deemed related to experimental drug or placebo by doctors.  A total of 
4patients left the study because of medical problems.  The most common medical 
problems are listed below.

WERE THERE ANY SERIOUS MEDICAL 
PROBLEMS?
A medical problem is considered “serious” when it is life -threatening, needs hospital 
care, or causes lasting problems.  
Two (2) patients (1%, or 1 out of 100 patients) had serious medical problems.  Both 
patients experienced rhabdomyolysis, or the breakd own of muscle tissue that releases 
a damaging protein into the blood.  Both patients were in the PF -06700841 treatment 
group and both cases of rhabdomyolysis were considered by the doctors as not 
related to study medicines.  No patients died during the stu dy.
