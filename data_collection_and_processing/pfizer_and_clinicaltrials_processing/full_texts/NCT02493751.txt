1CLINICAL TRIAL RESULTS
This summary reports the results of only one study.  Researchers must look at the 
results of many types of studies to understand if a study medicine works, how it 
works, and if it is safe to prescribe to patients.  The results of this study might be 
different than the results of other studies that the researchers review.

2WHY WAS THIS STUDY DONE?
The kidneys are organs in the body that help get rid of waste while also controlling 
the amount of water in the body by producing urine.  Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is a 
type of kidney cancer that starts in the small tubes of the kidney.  It is the most 
common kind of kidney cancer found in adults.  Kidney cancer is called advanced 
when it has grown or spread outside of the kidney.  Treatment for advanced RCC 
may include all or some of the following:
surgery to remove a part of the kidney or the whole kidn ey 
radiation therapy, in which beams of intense energy are used to kill cancer cells
treatment with chemical substances (chemotherapy) 
treatment that uses the body’s own immune system to fight cancer.  Substances 
made by the body or in a laboratory are u sed to boost, direct, or restore the 
body’s own natural defense against cancer 
(immunotherapy/biotherapy/biologic therapy) 
Avelumab is approved in certain countries for the treatment of some cancers and is a 
drug that stimulates the body’s own defense sys tem against cancer.  Axitinib is 
approved in certain countries for the treatment of advanced RCC for certain patients
after one prior treatment .  At the time of this study, avelumab in combination with 
axitinib was not approved for treatment of patients wi th advanced RCC.  Recently, 
avelumab in combination with axitinib has been approved in some countries as 
treatment for patients with advanced RCC.
The purpose of this study was to find the highest dose level tested of avelumab and 
axitinib taken together t hat is considered safe enough (less than 2 dose limiting 
toxicities [DLTs] in 6 patients) to test in advanced RCC patients in further studies.  
This is called the “maximum tolerated dose”.
Researchers wanted to know:
What is the maximum tolerated dose level of avelumab in combination 
with axitinib?
Dose Limiting Toxicities, DLTs, are certain medical problems caused by taking a 
medicine or medicines which require the patient to lower the dose they are taking or 
090177e1936c813c\Approved\Approved On: 09-May-2020 01:48 (GMT)
3to stop taking the medicine (permanently or temporarily).  DLTs can be many things, 
and may include, for example, fever with a low count of white blood cells.
WHAT HAPPENED DURING THE STUDY?
The study evaluated a group of patients who did not receive any treatment for 
advanced RCC before joining this study, to find out what dose of avelumab was best 
to use in future clinical studies, when taken in combination with axitinib.  Three 
different dose strength combinations of avelumab and axitinib were planned.  The 
highest planned dose combination of avelumab and axitinib (DL1) was found to be an 
acceptable dose in this study, and therefore the other 2 combinations (DL -1A and 
DL-1B) were not explored.  Avelumab was given into the vein through a small needle, 
and axitinib tablets were taken by mouth.  The treatment groups for this 
“dose -finding phase” are shown below:
DL1: avelumab 10 milligrams (mg) for each kilogram (kg) of the patient’s body 
weight, every 2 weeks + axitinib 5 mg, 2 times a day
DL-1A: avelumab 5 mg for each kg of body weight, every 2 weeks + axitinib 
5mg, 2 times a day (planned, but not investigated in this study)
DL-1B: avelumab 10 mg for each kg of body weight, every 2 weeks + axitinib 
3mg, 2 times a day (planned, but not investigated in th is study)
This was an “open -label” study, which means that the patients and the researchers 
knew which medicine the patients received. 
The figure below shows what happened during this study.

4There were 2 parts in the study.  The first part was the “dose -finding phase”.  In this 
part of the study, the highest dose level, DL1, was tested to see if it is safe to use in 
further studies. 
The second part was the “dose expansion phase”.  In this part of the study, the DL1 
dose combination was given to patients to make sure that the right dose was chosen 
for future studies.
To understand what happens to axitinib in the body, 16 patients received axitinib 
tablets alone for 7 days (this was known as the “lead in period”) prior to the 
combination (avelumab + axitin ib).
The Sponsor ran this study at 14 locations in the United Kingdom, the United States, 
and Japan .  It began 15 October 2015 and is ongoing.  42 men and 13 women 
participated.  38 patients were younger than 65 years, and 17 patients were 65 years or 
older.  At the time of data collection, patients were in the study for almost 3 years; the 
study was ongoing.  
Patients were to be treated in the dose -finding phase until DLT data from 6 patients 
on the highest dose of avelumab and axitinib were collected.  T his dose was then 
given in the “dose -expansion phase” of the study, to test the safety and effectiveness 
of the dose.  Fifty -five patients received the study medications.  At the time of data 
collection, 20 patients were still receiving the study medicatio ns: 31% (17 out of 55) of 
patients were still treated with both study medications, 2% (1 out of 55) of patients 
090177e1936c813c\Approved\Approved On: 09-May-2020 01:48 (GMT)
5were still treated with avelumab alone, and 4% (2 out of 55) of patients were still 
being treated with axitinib alone.  Thirty -five patients dis continued study medication.  
The main reason why patients discontinued study medication was because their 
advanced RCC worsened.
When the data were collected in April 2018, the Sponsor began reviewing the 
information collected.  The Sponsor then created a report of the results.  This is a 
summary of that report. 
WHAT WERE THE RESULTS OF THE STUDY?
What is the observed DLT of DL1?
There was 1 patient (out of 6) that had 1 medical problem that was considered a DLT.  
This medical problem was proteinuria, whi ch is protein in the urine.  So, since there 
was only a single DLT among the patients in the dose finding phase at DL1, DL1 was 
considered an acceptable dose.  For this reason, the dose of avelumab in combination 
with axitinib recommended for the next stud y was determined to be avelumab 
10mg/kg through a needle in the vein every 2 weeks + axitinib 5 mg oral 2 times a 
day (DL1).
This does not mean that everyone in this study had these results.  Other studies may 
produce different results, as well.  These ar e just some of the main findings of the 
study, and more information may be available at the websites listed at the end of this 
summary.  
WHAT MEDICAL PROBLEMS DID PATIENTS 
HAVE DURING THE STUDY?
The researchers recorded any medical problems the participants had during the study.  
Participants could have had medical problems for reasons not related to the study (for 
example, caused by an underlying disease or by chance).  Or, medical problems could 
also have been caused by a study treatment, or by another medicine the participant 
was taking.  Sometimes the cause of a medical problem is unknown.  By comparing 
medical problems across many treatment groups in many studies, doctors try to 
understand what the side effects of an experimental drug might b e.

9WERE THERE ANY SERIOUS MEDICAL 
PROBLEMS?
A medical problem is considered “serious” when it is life -threatening, needs hospital 
care, or causes lasting problems.  
42% (23 out of 55) of patients had serious medical problems.  31% (5 out of 16) of 
patients in the DL1 group with lead -in and 46% (18 out of 39) of patients in the DL1 
group had a serious medical problem.  24% (13 out of 55) of patients had serious 
medical problems related to study treatment as assessed by the investigator.  
13patients died during the study, of which 3 died because of a serious medical 
problem.  Of the 3 patients that died due to a medical problem, the deaths of 
2patients were related to another underlying illness.
