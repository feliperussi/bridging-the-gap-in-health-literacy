1CLINICAL TRIAL RESULTS
This summary reports the results of only one study.  Researchers must look at the 
results of many types of studies to understand if a study medicine works, how it 
works, and if it is safe to prescribe to patients.  The results of this study might be 
differ ent than the results of other studies that the researchers review.

2WHY WAS THIS STUDY DONE?
Rheumatoid arthritis, or RA, is a disease that causes swelling, pain, and stiffness in the 
joints.  RA is an autoimmune disease, which means that patients with RA have an 
overactive immune system that mistakenly attacks healthy parts of the body, such as 
the joints.  RA can cause permanent damage to the joints if it goes unchecked, so 
researchers are looking for new treatment options for RA.
PF-06651600 is a medicine that is being studied as a possible treatment for R A.  
Because it is still being tested , PF-06651600 has not been approved for use outside of 
research studies.
The main goal of this study was to learn more about the use of PF-06651600 in 
patients with R A.  Researchers wanted to know:
At week 8 of the study, did patie nts who received PF -06651600 show an 
improvement in RA, compared to patients who received placebo?
A placebo does not have any medicine in it, but looks just like the medicine.  To 
answer this question, the researchers used a tool called the Simple Disease Activity 
Index (SDAI) to assess RA signs and symptoms.
WHAT HAPPENED DURING THE STUDY?
This study compared 2 groups of patients taking either PF-06651600 or placebo, to 
find out if they would have an improvement in RA. The study included adult patients 
with RAwho had tried certain other RA medicines, such as methotrexate, but did not 
get did adequate relief. The patients and researchers did not know who took 
PF-06651600 and who took the placebo.  This is known as a “blinded” study.  
Patients were assigned to each group by chance alone. 
First, p atients were screened by the study doctor to make sure they were a good fit to 
join the study.  This was known as the “screening period”, which lasted up to 5weeks .  
Next, patients were assigned to receive either PF-06651600 200 milligrams (mg) or 
placebo .  The medicines were taken by mouth every day for 8 weeks. During this 
time, patients were to continue taking methotrexate and certain other medicines, as 
090177e1935bc1db\Approved\Approved On: 30-Apr-2020 06:42 (GMT)
3prescribed by their doctor. Patients were assigned to each group by chance alone.  
Putting people into groups by chance helps make the groups more even to compare.
After patients completed study treatment, there was a follow -up period that lasted for 
4 weeks . The figure below shows what happened during this study.
While patients were only in the study for about 12 weeks (treatment plus follow -up), 
the entire study took about 1 year to complete.  The sponsor ran this study at
32locations in 9 countries in Europe and North America .  It began 20 December 
2016 and ended 12 December 2017.  13 men (1 9%) and 57 women (8 1%) 
participated.  All patients were between the ages of 24 and 74. 
Patients were to be treated for 8 weeks then complete the 4 week follow -up period.
Of the 70 patients who started the study, 59 (84%) finished it.  11 patients (16%) left

4before the study was over by their choice or a doctor decided it was best for a patient 
to stop the study.
When the study ended i n December 2017 , the Sponsor began reviewing the 
information collected.  The Sponsor then created a report of the results. This is a 
summary of that report. 
WHAT WERE THE RESULTS OF THE STUDY?
At week 8 of the study, did patients who received 
PF-06651600 show  an improvement in RA, compared to 
patients who received placebo?
To answer this question, the researchers used the SDAI to assess the patients’ RA 
signs and symptoms.  They compared the SDAI scores from before patients started 
treatment to after they finished treatment (week 8).  On average, patients who 
received PF-06651600 hada change in SDAI score (improvement in RA) of about 
26points.  On average, patients who received placebo had a change in SDAI score 
(improvement in RA) of about 17 points. The researchers have decided that these 
results are not likely based on chance.  PF-06651600 maybe an option for treating 
RA.

5This does not mean that everyone in this study had these results.  Other studies may 
produce different results, as well.  These are just some of the main findings of the 
study, and more information may be available at the websites listed at the end of this
summary.  
WHAT MEDICAL PROBLEMS DID PATIENTS
HAVE DURING THE STUDY?
The researchers recorded any medical problems the patients had during the study. 
Patients could have had medical problems for reasons not related to the study (for 
example, caused by an underlying disease or by chance). Or, medical problems could 
also have been caused by a study treatment, or by another medicine the patient was 
taking. Somet imes the cause of a medical problem is unknown. By comparing 
medical problems across many treatment groups in many studies, doctors try to 
understand what the side effects of an experimental drug might be.
Of the 7 0patients who joined the study , 25(36%)patients had at least 1 medical 
problem .A total of 3(4%)patients left the study because of medical problems.  The 
most common medical problems are listed below.

6WERE THERE ANY SERIOUS MEDICAL 
PROBLEMS?
A medical problem is considered “serious” when it is life -threatening, needs hospital 
care, or causes lasting problems .  
No patients in this study had serious medical problems.  No patients died during the 
study.

Please remember that researchers look at the results of many studies to fi nd out which 
medic ines can work and are safe for patients.   
Again, thank  you for volunteering.
We do research to try to find the 
best ways to help patients, and you 
helped us to do that !
