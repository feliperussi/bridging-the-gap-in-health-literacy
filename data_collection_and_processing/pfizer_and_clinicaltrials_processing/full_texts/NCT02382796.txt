CLINICAL TRIAL RESULTS
This summary reports the results of only one study.  Researchers must look at the 
results of many types of studies to understand if a study medicine works, how it 
works, and if it is safe to prescribe to patients.  The results of this study might be 
different than the results of other studies that the researchers review.

2WHY WAS THIS STUDY DONE?
Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the most common type of lung cancer.  In 
some patients with NSCLC, their cancer cells have changes (mutations) in the gene 
that makes a protein called epidermal growth factor receptor, or “EGFR”.  These 
mutations in EGFR help stimulate cancer cells to grow and multiply.  Researchers are 
looking for better trea tments for patients with NSCLC whose cancer cells have 
mutations in the EGFR gene.
Dacomitinib (Vizimpro®) is a medicine that has been approved in the United States, 
Japan and European Union as treatment for patients with NSCLC.  At the time of 
this study, dacomitinib was not yet approved for treatment of patients with NSCLC.  
Dacomitinib works by blocking the activity of a group of proteins called the human 
epidermal growth factor receptor (HER) family (including EGFR [also known as 
HER1], HER2, and HER4).   These are proteins on the surface of cells that can 
stimulate cancer cells to grow and multiply.  By blocking the activity of these proteins 
dacomitinib may be able to help limit the growth and spread of cancer cells.  
Dacomitinib is given as a tablet on ce a day to be taken by mouth.
The purpose of this study was to provide continued access to dacomitinib for patients 
who participated in other dacomitinib studies in Japan and would be deemed to derive 
benefit from continued dacomitinib treatment.
Research ers also wanted to learn more about the safety of dacomitinib.  They 
monitored the patients for any medical problems that happened while they were in 
the study.
WHAT HAPPENED DURING THE STUDY?
This study evaluated a group of patients who received dacomitin ib in previous studies 
for advanced NSCLC, to have them continue treatment with dacomitinib.
The study included patients who had advanced NSCLC and who received dacomitinib 
in a previous study in Japan (Study A7471009 or Study A7471050) without unpleasant 
side effects based on the researcher’s evaluation.  For this study, 3 different dose 
090177e194c9cb1d\Approved\Approved On: 29-Sep-2020 05:31 (GMT)
3strengths of dacomitinib oral tablets were planned:
45 mg per day
30 mg per day
15 mg per day
The dose strength patients started on in this study, was the same as the dose the 
patient ended on in the previous study.  There were 7 patients included in this study; 
5patients started at a dose of 15 mg once a day and 2 patients started at a dose of 
30mg once a day.
This was an “open -label” study, which means that the patients and the researchers 
knew which medicine the patients received.
The figure below shows what happened during the study.
The Sponsor ran this study in Japan.  It began 10 July 2015 and ended 30 May 2019.

4Three (3) men and 4 women participated.  All patients were between the ages of 68 
and 76 and had an average weight of 56 kg.  The study doctor was allowed to change 
the strength of the dacomitinib dose during the study, depending on how the 
treatment made the patients feel.
Patients were to be treate d until there was evidence of the study drug helping to relief 
NSCLC symptoms, as determined by the study doctor.  All 7 patients left before the 
study was over by their choice or a doctor decided it was best for a patient to stop 
being in the study, of wh ich 3 patients left as dacomitinib became available on the 
market.
When the study ended in May 2019, the Sponsor began reviewing the information 
collected.  The Sponsor then created a report of the results.  This is a summary of that 
report.
WHAT WERE THE RESULTS OF THE STUDY?
The main purpose of the study was to allow patients with NSCLC who received 
dacomitinib in a previous study, to continue treatment with dacomitinib while their 
health was monitored.  The medical problems that the patients had during t his study, 
is summarized below.
More information may be available at the websites listed at the end of this summary.
WHAT MEDICAL PROBLEMS DID 
PARTICIPANTS HAVE DURING THE STUDY?
The researchers recorded any medical problems the participants had during the study.  
Participants could have had medical problems for reasons not related to the study (for 
example, caused by an underlying disease or by chance).  Or, medical problems could 
also have been caused by a study treatment or by another medicine the partic ipant was 
taking.  Sometimes the cause of a medical problem is unknown.  By comparing 
medical problems across many treatment groups in many studies, doctors try to 
understand what the side effects of an experimental drug might be.

5All of the 7 patients in this study had at least 1 medical problem.  None of the patients 
left the study because of medical problems.  The most common medical problems are 
listed below.
Most Common Medical Problems
(Reported by More Than 1 Patient)
Medical ProblemDacomitinib
(7 Patients Treated)
Diarrhea 2 (29%)
Lung infection 2 (29%)
Nail inflammation 2 (29%)
Bruise (contusion) 2 (29%)
Headache 2 (29%)
Dry skin 2 (29%)
Hives (red itchy bumps on the 
skin)2 (29%)
WERE THERE ANY SERIOUS MEDICAL 
PROBLEMS?
A medical problem is considered “serious” when it is life -threatening, needs hospital 
care, or causes lasting problems.  
Two (2) out of 7 patients (29%) had a total of 3 serious medical problems.  No 
patients died during the study.  All serious side effec ts were considered by the 
researchers as not related to study medicine.
The 3 serious side effects were as follows:

6Obstruction (blockage) in the digestive system and lung infection by a patient 
that received 15 mg dacomitinib.
A tumor in the pancreas (gland organ that forms part of the digestive system) 
by a patient that received 15 mg dacomitinib.

Please remember that researchers look at the results of many studies to find out w hich 
medicines can work and are safe for patients.
Again, thank  you for volunteering.
We do research to try to find the 
best ways to help patients, and you 
helped us to do that!
