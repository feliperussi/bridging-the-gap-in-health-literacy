2WHY WAS THIS STUDY DONE?
A “neutrophil” is a type of white blood cell that fights infections in the body. Certain 
chemotherapy medicines that are used for trea ting cancer can cause t he number of 
neutrophils in the body to be too low.  This is known as “chemotherapy -induced 
neutropenia”, or CIN.  Patients with CIN are at increased risk for fever and serious 
infections.
There are medicines that can be used to treat CIN .  One medicine that is use d is 
called Neulasta®.  Neul asta may increase the number of neutrophils in the blood .
This study was designed to study a new medicine being developed for CIN.  This 
medicine is called HSP -130 (PF -06881894), and it is similar to Neulasta. The r eason 
for studying HSP -130 is to give patients another treatment option. HSP-130 is still 
being studied and has not been approved for use outside of clinical studies.
Forthis study, researchers were interested in learn ing how HSP -130 affects the body , 
when given as a single dose or as multiple doses. This information is important to 
help determine the right dose of HSP -130.  The study was for women with breast 
cancer that ha dnot spread to other parts of the body .  It was divided into 2 parts.  In
the first part of the study, researchers wanted to answer this question:
What effect did HSP -130 have on the number of neutrophils in 
patients’ blood , if they were not getting chemotherapy ?
For the second part of the study, researchers wanted to answer this question:
How many days did patients have s everely low neutrophil counts 
(neutropenia) during the irfirst chemotherapy cycle?
WHAT HAPPENED DURING THE STUDY?
This study looked at how HSP -130 affects the b ody.  The study included women with 
breast cancer wh o had never before taken chemotherapy.  This was an “open -label” 
study, which means that both the patients and researchers knew what treatment was 
being given.

3Since t he study was divided into 2 parts , each patient took part in only Part 1 or 
Part2.  Patients were checked by the study doctor to make sure they were a good fit 
to join the study .  This was called “screening ”.
Part 1 -Without Chemotherapy
Part 1 lasted about 30 days and i ncluded 12 patients with breast cancer .  The first 
6patients receive d 1dose ( 3 mg )of HSP -130. The next 6 patients received
1dose (6mg)of HSP -130.  HSP-130was given as an injection just under the skin.  
The researchers tested patients’ blood throughout the study to seehow the body 
responds to the HSP-130, and to decide if the lower dose (3 mg) would be used
during Part 2 of the study .
Part 2 -With Chemotherapy
Part 2 lasted about 94days and include d 13 patients who ha dalready had surgery for 
their breast cancer .  This part of the study was divided into 4 “chemotherapy 
treatment cycles” that each lasted about 3 weeks .  During each cycle, patients received 
1dose ( 6 mg )of HSP -130(for a total of 4 doses), and chemotherapy as prescribed by 
their study doctor. The researchers tested patients’ blood throug hout the study to 
learn how the body responds to the HSP-130.
The figure below shows what happened during the study.

4While patients were only in the study for about 1 month (Part 1) or 4 months (Part 2) , 
the entire study took about 2 years to complete.   Patients joined the study at 1 of 7 
locations in Hungary and Spain.  It began 21 December 2015 and ended 05 October 
2017.  A total of 25 women between the ages of 39 and 78 participated.  All 
25patients (100%) completed the study. When the study ended inOctober 2017 , the 
Sponsor review edthe total infor mation collected during the study .  The Sponsor then 
created a report of the results. This is a summary of that report.
WHAT WERE THE RESULTS OF THE STUDY?
What effe ct did HSP -130 have on the number of neutrophils 
in patients’ blood , if they were not getting chemotherapy ?
During Part 1 of this study, the researchers found that neutrophi l levels increased in 
patients who received HSP -130.  These results are similar to results reported in 
patients trea ted with Neulast awhen used with chemotherapy.   
Neutrophil levels were higher in th e patients who received a 6 mg dose of HSP-130
than in those who received a 3 mg dose of HSP-130.  Based on these results, the 
researchers sel ected 6 mg as the dose to test during Part 2.
How  many days did patients have severe ly low neutrophil 
counts during their first chemotherapy cycle ? 
For each patient in Part 2 , chemotherapy caused the neutrophil count to decrease.  
On average, patients had severe ly low neutrophil count sfor less than 1 day (0.67, or 
about 2/3 of a day) during their first chemotherapy treatment cycle .  These results are
similar to results reported in patients treated with Neulasta.  
All 25 patients had an increase in neutrophil counts as a result of receiving HSP -130.  
However, the specific ways that each patient’s body responded may have been 
different , which is usual in clinical studies .  These are just some of the main findings 
of the study, and more information may be available at the websites lis ted at the end 
of this summary.

5WHAT MEDICAL PROBLEMS DID PATIENTS
HAVE DURING THE STUDY ?
The researchers recorded any medical problems the participant shad during the study. 
Participant s could have had medical problems for reasons not related to the stu dy (for 
example, caused by an underlying disease or by chance). Or, medical problems could 
have been caused by a study treatment, or by another medicine the participan twas 
taking. Sometimes the cause of a medical problem is unknown. By comparing 
medica l problems across many treatment groups in many studies, doctors try to 
understand what the side effects of an experimental drug might be .
All patients (100%) in this study had at least 1 non-serious medical problem (that 
means a medical problem that is not life -threatening, does not cause lasting problems, 
or does not need hospital care).  The most common non -serious medical problems 
reported by pa rticipants in this study are listed below.

patients (15%) had at least 1 serious medical problem .  One patie nt was in hospital 
2times for neutropenia with fever. The other patient was in hospital 1 time for 
neutropenia with fever .  No patients died during the study.

has been completed.  The total information collected during the final study is 
currently being reviewed.
Please remember that researchers look at the results of many studies to find out which 
medicines are most appropriate foreach patient.
