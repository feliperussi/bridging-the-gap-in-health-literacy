Why was this study done?
What is Chronic Myeloid Leukemia?
Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is a cancer that begins in cells within the bone 
marrow. The bone marrow is the spongy inner portion of bones where blood cells are 
made. Normally, these cells divide into different types of blood cells: white blood 
cells, red blood cells, and platelets.
Sometimes a mistake happens when the bone marrow cells divide and unhealthy cells 
are produced. In C ML, the unhealthy cells produce a protein called breakpoint cluster 
region protein/Abelson murine leukemia viral oncogene (BCR -ABL). The protein 
BCR-ABL causes CML. This protein leads to the production of too many unhealthy 
cells (leukemic cells) that crow d out healthy cells. 
What is Bosutinib?
Tyrosine kinases are proteins in the body that control how cells grow and divide. 
Bosutinib is a drug that blocks a tyrosine kinase called BCR -ABL, which means that 
when treated with bosutinib, BCR -ABL is deactivat ed or is less active. This study 
compared Bosulif® /bosutinib 400 mg and imatinib 400 mg.  Both drugs are tablets 
taken by mouth.  
At the time this study began, bosutinib was approved for patients with CML when the 
initial treatment given is no longer controlling the disease (known as resistance) or has 
had to be stopped because they could not tolerate it (known as intolerance).  Imatinib 
is a marketed drug approved for the treatment of patients with newly diagnosed CML, 
and is considered a standard tre atment for newly diagnosed/previously untreated 
CML.

What was the purpose of this study?
The main reason researchers did this study was to provide another choice for the 
treatment of CML in adult patients who were newly diagnosed. Specifically, 
researchers wanted to know what percentage (%) of participants receiving bosutinib 
400 mg reached a major molecular response (MMR) at 48 weeks after treatment 
started compared to participants receiving imatinib 400 mg. A major molecular 
response means that the participant has low levels of BCR -ABL, more specifically, 
levels of BCR -ABL that are 0.1% or less.  In addition, researchers wanted to know 
about any medical problems participants had during the study.
What happened during the study?
How was the study done?
Researchers tested bosutinib on a group of study participants to find out if 
participants taking bosutinib 400 mg reached MMR at 48 weeks compared to 
participants taking imatinib 400 mg.  Participants were assigned to one of the 
following treatment groups:Researchers wanted to know: 
What percentage (%) of participants receiving bosutinib 400 mg 
reached a MMR at 48 weeks compared to participants receiving 
imatinib 400 mg? A major molecular response means that 
BCR -ABL levels were 0.1% or less.

Bosutinib 400 mg, an investigational drug, which means bosutinib was not 
approved for use in this country to treat CML as initial therapy when the study 
started
Imatinib 400 mg
This was an “open -label” study, which means that doctors and participants knew
which treatment participants were receiving.  However, the laboratory that evaluated 
MMR was not aware of which treatment participants received (blinded).  Participants 
were assigned to each treatment group by chance, like a flip of a coin, and had an 
equal chance of assignment to either treatment group. This is called randomization 
and is done to make the groups more similar. 
Study Plan
During this 48 -week treatment period, participants were required to meet with their 
study doctor every 4 weeks for the first 24 weeks, then at 36 weeks, and at 48 weeks 
for an exam (Core Treatment Phase).
If participants responded to treatment, they continued to take their assigned treatment 
for 4 more years (192 weeks) (Extension Phase) after the initial 48 weeks of treat ment. 
Participants met with their study doctor for follow -up visits until they reached 5 years 
of treatment or until the CML got worse.  The participants could continue to receive 
treatment after the study was completed at the discretion of their treating physician.

Participants were to be treated until 5 years after starting the study.  Of the              
536 participants who started the study, 463 participants finished the study.
73 participants (14%; 14 out of 100) did not finish the study because of: 
Participant request: 24 participants (5%; 5 out of 100)
Participant passed away: 28 participants (5%; 5 out of 100)
Lost to follow -up: 13 participants (2%; 2 out of 100)
Missing: 3 participants (1%; 1 out of 100)
Other reason: 3 participants  (1%; 1 out of 100)
Physician request: (2 participants, or less than 1%, did not finish the study 
because their doctor decided it was best for a participant to stop being in the 
study).
Of the 53 3 participants who received treatment, a total of 314 participants          
(59%; 59 out of 100) were still receiving the study drug at the end of the 5 -year study 
period in both groups.
160 (60%; 60 out of 100) participants in the bosutinib group were sti ll receiving 
bosutinib at the end of the study period. 154 (58%; 58 out of 100) participants 
in the imatinib group were still receiving imatinib at the end of the study 
period.  
219 (41%; 41 out of 100) participants discontinued treatment.  The most 
commo n reasons for discontinuing treatment (occurring in ≥5% of 
participants) were:
o100 participants (19%; 19 out of 100) stopped treatment due to a 
medical problem.  67 participants (25%; 25 out of 100) in the bosutinib 
group stopped treatment because of a med ical problem and 
33participants (13%; 13 out of 100) in the imatinib group stopped 
treatment because of a medical problem.
o56 participants (11%; 11 out of 100) stopped treatment because they did 
not respond to treatment as expected (treatment failure).  1 3 participants 
(5%; 5 out of 100) in the bosutinib group and 43 participants (16%;

How long did the study last?
Study participants were in the study for 5 years.  The enti re study took almost 6 years 
to complete.
The Sponsor began reviewing the information collected in 2016 and the created a 
report of the results.  The study ended in April 2020 and another report was created 
that included longer -term information.  This is a summary of the 2020 report. 
What were the results of the study?
What percentage (%) of participants receiving bosutinib 400 mg reached a 
MMR at 48 weeks compared to participants receiving imatinib 400 mg?  
47% (47 out of 100) of participants receiving bosutinib 400 mg achieved MMR at 
Week 48, wh ile 37% (37 out of 100) of participants receiving imatinib 400 mg 
achieved MMR at Week 48.

Based on these results, researchers decided that the results are likely the result of the 
medication and not due to chance.  Bosutinib may be an option for treatin g patients 
with newly diagnosed CML.
This does not mean that everyone in this study had these results.  These are just some 
of the main findings of this study.  Other studies may have different results. 
What medical problems did participants have during 
the study?
The researchers recorded any medical problems the participants had during the study.  
Participants could have had medical problems for reasons not related to the study (for 
example, caused by an underlying disease or by chance).  Or, medical problems could 
also have been caused by a study treatment or by another treatment the participant 
was taking.  Sometimes the cause of a medical problem is unknown.  By comparing 
medical problems across many treatment groups in many studies, doctors try to 
understand what effects a study medication might have on a participant.
527 participants out of 533 (99%; 99 out of 100) participants in this study had at least 
1 medical problem.  496 participants out of 533 (93%; 93 out of 100) participants had 
medical p roblems that the researchers thought were caused by one of the study drugs. 
Of the 268 participants treated with bosutinib, 265 participants (99%; 99 out of 100) 
had medical problems.  Of the 265 participants treated with imatinib, 262 of the 
265(99%; 99 out of 100) participants had medical problems.
Of the 533 participants, 106 participants (20%; 20 out of 100) stopped taking study 
treatment because of medical problems.  Of the participants treated with bosutinib, 
68of the 268 participants (25%; 25 out of 100) stopped taking bosutinib because of 
medical problems.  Of the participants treated with imatinib, 38 of the 
265participants (14%; 14 out of 100) stopped taking study treatment because of 
medical problems.  The most common medical problems –those reported by at least 
10% of participants –are described below.

A medical problem is considered “serious” when it is life threatening, needs hospital 
care, or causes lasting problems. The serious medical problems reported by at least 1% 
of participants are listed in Table 2 below.
166 participants (31%, or 31 out of 100 participants) out of 533 participants in the study
