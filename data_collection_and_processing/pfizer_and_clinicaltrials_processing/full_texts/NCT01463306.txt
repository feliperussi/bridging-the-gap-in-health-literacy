1CLINICAL TRIAL RESULTS
This summary reports the results of only one study.  Researchers must look at the 
results of many types of studies to understand if a study medicine works, how it 
works, and if it is safe to prescribe to patients.  The results of this study might be 
differ ent than the results of other studies that the researchers review.

2WHY WAS THIS STUDY DONE ?
Epilepsy is a condition in which a person has recurring seizures . Epilepsy occurs in 
both adults and children and can affect multiple daily life activities.   A seizure is a 
sudden increase in electrical activity in the brain.  Seizures can cause many different 
symptoms, such as shaking, feeling confused, or l osing control of your body.   
When a seizure occurs in only one part of the brain, it is known as a partial onset 
seizure.  When a seizure occur sthroughout the whole brain, it is known as a 
generalized seizure.  The most common type of generalized seizure is a primary 
generalized to nic-clonic (PGTC) seizure. Participant s were asked to take part in this 
research study because they were diagnosed with epilepsy with either partial onset or 
PGTC seizures .
Pregabalin is the medicine that was used during this s tudy.  Pregabalin is prescribed by 
doctors for the treatment of partial onset seizures in young children and adults.   
Pregabalin is not approved for the treatment of PGTC seizures.
The purpose of this study was to learn more about the safety of pregabalin in children 
with partial onset seizures, and in children and adults with PGTC seizures.
WHAT HAPPENED DURING THE STUDY?
This study evaluate da group of participant s to learn more about the safety of 
pregabalin.  The study included participant s between the ages of 1 month and 16 years 
who were diagnosed with epilepsy with partial onset seizures, and participants 
between the ages of 5 years and 65 years who were diagnosed with epilepsy with 
PGTC seizures.  Some of these participant s had participat ed in a previous study with 
pregabalin, and all participants were already taking 1 to 3 other treatments for epilepsy 
(antiepileptic drugs to help prevent seizures ) in addition to pregabalin .  Participant s 
continued to take their other antiepileptic drugs during the study.  
This was an “open -label” study, which means that the participants and the researchers 
knew which treatment sand dose sthey received during the study.  Pregabalin was 
divided into 2 or 3 daily doses and taken by mouth, either as tablets or a liquid, for 
approximately 1 year.

3For participants between 1 month and 16 years old, the beginning pregabalin dose 
was based on weight:   
2.5 milligrams (mg) for each kilogram (kg) of body weight per day, for 
participants who weigh 30 kg (66 pounds) or more 
3.5 milligrams for each kilogram of body weight per day, for participants who 
weigh less than 30kg (66 pounds)
For participants 17 years and older, the beginning pregabalin dose was a total of 
150mg per day, divided into 2 dail y doses of 75 mg.
The study doctor may have adjusted the sedoses, as needed, but study participants did 
not receive more than 600 mg of pregabalin per day.
Participants were asked to attend 9 visits at the study center, and were contacted by 
phone at leas t once per month.  Participants (or their parents) were also asked to 
record any seizures in a diary.
The figure on the following page shows what happened during this study.

4The sponsor ran this study at 142locations in 31countries in Asia, Europe, and 
North America .  It began 21 February 2012 and ended 22 August 2019.  A total of 
319(53%)males and 286(47%)females participated.   491 (81%) participants were 
16years or younger, and 114 (19%) participants were 17 years or older.
A total of 76% (462 of 605 ) oftheparticipant s who started the study, finished.  A 
total of 24% (142 of 605 ) of the p articipant s left before the study was over by their 
choice ,a doctor decided it was best that they stop the study , or they passed away for a 
reason not cause d by taking pregabalin .  Additionally, 1 (less than 1%) participant left 
the study safely, but further information could not be reported due to an issue with 
the approval required by local healthcare authorities.
When the study ended in August 2019, the Sponsor reviewed the infor mation 
collected.  The Sponsor then cr eated a report of the results. This is a summary of that 
report.

5WHAT WERE THE RESULTS OF THE STUDY?
To learn more about safety, the study doctors did a number of tests and exams, 
including lab tests, heart tracings, physical exams, exams of the nervous system and 
brain function, and vital signs (blood pressure and heart rate).  There were no 
meaningful changes found on these tests.
Researchers al so collected information on the frequency of seizures that happened 
during the study.  On average, participants had less frequent seizures over the course 
of 28 days with pregabalin treatment. 
This does not mean that everyone in this study had these results . Other studies may 
produce different results , as well .  These are just some of the main findings of the 
study, and more information may be available at the websites listed at the end of this 
summary.   
WHAT MEDICAL PROBLEMS DID 
PARTICIPANT SHAVE DURING THE STUDY ?
The researchers recorded any medical problems the participant shad during the study. 
Participant s could have had medical problems for reasons not related to the study (for 
example, caused by an underlying disease or by chance). Or, medical problems could 
also have been caused by a study treatment, or by another medicine the participant
was taking. Sometimes the cause of a medical problem is unknown. By comparing 
medical problems across treatment groups in many studies , doctors try to understand 
what the side effects of an experimental drug might be.
A total of 66% (402 out of 605 )of participant s had at least 1 medical problem , 
including 68% (336 out of 491 ) of participant s under 17 years old, and 58% (66 out of 
114) of participant s 17 years or older .A total of 18(3%) participant s left the study 
because of medical problems.  The most common medical problems are listed on the 
following page .

7WERE THERE ANY SERIOUS MEDICAL 
PROBLEMS ?
A medical problem is considered “serious” when it is life -threatening, needs hospital 
care, or causes lasting problems .  
A total of 77(13%) participant s had serious medical problems :15%(74 out of 491 )of 
participant s under 17 years old and 3% (3 out of 114)of participant s 17 years or older.  
Six (6)participants died during the study and 1 participant died after they completed 
the study.  The study doctor determined that none of these death s were related to the 
study treatment. 
The most common serious medical problems are listed below:
