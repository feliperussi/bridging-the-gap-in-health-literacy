2WHY WAS THIS STUDY DONE?
Non-small -cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the most common type of lung cancer. In 
some patients with NSCLC, their cancer ce lls have changes in their DNA (genes) 
where 2 genes combine to create a new gene.  W hen this happens with the gene that 
makes the protein “ALK ”, the new gene is called an “ALK gene fusion”.  This ALK
gene fusion can cause tumors to form or can help existin g cancer cells grow faster.   
Researchers are looking for better treatments for patients with NSCLC whose cancer 
cells have an ALK gene fusion .
Crizotinib (also known as X ALKORI®) is a drug that is now approved for use in 
many countries including East Asian countries to treat NSCLC with ALK gene 
fusions.  Crizotinib works by blocking the activity of ALK, which is thought to slow 
or stop the growth of cancer cells with an ALK gene fusion .  This study compared 
crizotinib treatment to “platinum -based chemotherapy”, which is a medicine 
combination that was used as a first -line treatment for patients with NSCLC. 
Platinum -based chemotherapy is made up of the combination of the drug pemetrexed 
with either cisplatin or carboplatin .
The main purpose of thi s study was to see whether crizotinib treatment would keep 
patients’ cancer from growing for a longer period of time compared to patients 
treated with platinum -based chemotherapy.  To do this the researchers asked,
Do patients treated with crizotinib have more time before their cancer 
begins to grow, or before they pass away from any cause, compared to 
patients treated with platinum -based chemotherapy?
The researchers measured the “ progression -free survival time” which was defined as 
the time between starti ng the study and the patients’ NSCLC getting worse, or the 
patient passing away from any cause (such as from disease or an accident) .  The 
researchers then calculated the “ median ”progression -free survival time, which was 
the time point where half (50%) of the patients in astudy group had their NSCLC 
start to grow , or had passed away from any cause.
Researchers were also interested in learning more about the safety of crizotinib.  They

3monitored the patients for any m edical problems that happened while they were 
taking crizotinib or after they stopped taking crizotinib.
WHAT HAPPENED DURING THE STUDY?
This study compared 2 groups of patients to find out if patients treated with crizotinib 
would have more time before their cancer began to grow, or before they passed away 
from any cause, compared to patients treated with platinum -based chemotherapy .  
The study included men and women who were 18 to 70 years of age who met the 
following criteria:
Diagnosed with NSCLC that also had the following:
Positive test for ALK fusion gene ;
Locally advanced NSCLC and not suitable for local treatment, OR
Metastatic NSCLC (cancer had spread outside of the lungs) ;
Had not been treated for their NSCLC before using “systemic” medicines 
(taken by mouth or intravenously) ;
Had not been treated before with medicines that block ALK activity ;
Had any major surgeries completed at least 4 weeks before entering the study;
Had any radiation procedures completed at least 2 week s before entering the 
study, and had mostly recovered from radiation side effects;
Were able to at least walk around and care for themselves, and were out of bed 
at least 50% of the day.
The patients were assigned to either take 250mg of crizo tinib twice daily by mouth , 
or to receive platinum -based chemotherapy .  If the patient was assigned to receive 
platinum -based chemo therapy, they received standard doses of pemetrexed and either 
cisplatin or carboplatin, with the patient’s doctor deciding whether cisp latin or 
carboplatin was best for the patient.  The patients were assigned to either group by 
chance alone.  This is known as a “randomized” study.  This is done to reduce the 
differences between groups (like age or the number of men and women), which 
make s the groups more even to compare.  Patients who were assigned to receive

4platinum -based chemotherapy and had their NSCLC get worse were allowed to 
switch, or ‘cross over’, into the crizotinib treatment group.
The diagram below shows what happened during t he study.
While patients taking crizotinib were treated for an average of 106 weeks , the entire 
study took over 7 years to complete.  The Sponsor ran this study at 35locations in 
5countries in East Asia .  It began 29 September 2012 and ended 08 January 2020.  A 
total of 114 women and 93 men participated.  All patients were between the ages of 
23and 69. 
Patients were to be treated until their NSCLC got worse, they had too many medical 
problems or couldn’t tolerate the medicines, their overall health de clined, or they 
passed away . Of the 205patients who started treatment in the study, 55finished the 
study .  A total of 123 patients passed away before the study was completed, and 
3patients did not finish the study because of other reasons. Twenty one (21)patients 
left before the study was over by their choice or a doctor decided it was best for a 
patient to stop being in the study. In addition, 3patient swerelost to follow -up.

5When the study ended in January 2020 , the Sponsor reviewed the informat ion 
collected.  The Sponsor then created a report of the results. This is a summary of that 
report.
WHAT WERE THE RESULTS OF THE STUDY?
Did patients treated with crizotinib have m ore time before their 
cancer began to grow, or before they passed away from any cause, 
compared to patients treated with platinum -based chem otherapy?
This study found that patients treated with crizotinib had more time before their 
cancer began to grow, or before they passed away from any cause, compared to 
patients treated with p latinum -based chemotherapy.  The patients treated with 
crizotinib had a median time of 11months before their NSCLC began to grow or 
they passed away from any cause.  In comparison, the patients treated with 
platinum -based chemotherapy had a median time of7months before their NSCLC 
began to grow or they passed away from any cause.
Based on these results, the researchers have decided that the results are not likely the 
result of chance.  Crizotinib may be an option for treating patients with NSCLC 
whose cancer cells have an ALK gene fusion.  This does not mean that everyone in 
this study had these results.  Other studies may produce different results, as well.

WHAT MEDICAL PROBLEMS DID 
PARTICIPANTS HAVE DURING THE STUDY?
The researchers recorded any medical problems the participants had during the study.
Participants could have had medical problems for reasons not related to the study (for 
example, caused by an underlying disease or by chance). Or, medical problems could 
also have been caused by a study treatment or by another medicine the participant was 
taking. Sometimes the cause of a medical problem is unknown. By comparing 
medical problems across many treatment groups in many studies, doctors try to 
understand what the side effects of an experimental drug might be.
All but 1 patient in each treatment group in this study had at least 1 medical problem.  
A total of 32 patients left the study because of medical problems.  The most common 
medical problems are listed below.

WERE THERE ANY SERIOUS MEDICAL 
PROBLEMS?
A medical problem is considered “serious” when it is life -threatening, needs hospital 
care, or causes lasting problems.  
Forty six (46, or 44%) patients taking crizotinib and 13 patients (13%) treated with 
platinum -based chemotherapy had serious medical problems.
At the end of the study, 62 patients assigned to take crizotinib and 61 patients 
assigned to platinum -based chemotherapy had passed away.  Most deaths were due to
the patient’s NSCLC getting worse.  Two (2) patients taking crizotinib passed away 
from medical problems that their doctor thought might have been caused by taking 
crizotinib.   Serious medical problems are summarized in the table on the next page.
