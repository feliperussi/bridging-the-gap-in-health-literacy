1CLINICAL TRIAL RESULTS
This summary reports the results of only one study.  Researchers must look at the 
results of many types of studies to understand if a study medicine works, how it 
works, and if it is safe to prescribe to patients.  The results of this study might be 
different than the results of other studies that the researchers review .

2WHY WAS THIS STUDY DONE?
Transthyretin amyloid polyneuropathy (ATTR -PN) is a rare and life -threatening 
medical condition which worsens over time. There are about 10,000 people in the 
world known to have ATTR -PN. People with this condition have a particular 
protein , known as transthyretin amyloid, in their nerves. This can lead to problems 
with the nervous system, such as weakness, numbness, or pain in the hands and feet 
(known as “neuropathy”) and difficulty walking. ATTR -PN iscaused by a genetic 
mutation (change) in the transthyretin (TTR) gene .  The most common genetic 
mutation that causes ATTR -PN is called “Val30Met”.
Tafamidis is a study drug approved in some countries to treat adult patients with 
ATTR -PNto delay neurologi c symptoms.   The researchers in this study were 
interested in learning more about the long -term safety and effect sof tafamidis.
This study had several purposes: 
To continue to study if tafamidis is safe and the potential effects of tafamidis in 
patients with ATTR -PN over the long -term.
To continue to provide tafamidis to patients with ATTR -PN who had 
participated in previous clinical trials for tafamidis and were benefiting from 
taking it.
WHAT HAPPENED DURING THE STUDY?
This study included adult patients with ATTR -PN who had participated in prior 
studies with tafamidis and never had a heart or liver transplant. 
All patients in this study received tafamidis 20 milligrams, taken once per day every 
day by mouth. Patients w ere asked to attend clinic visits every 6 months, and were 
contacted by phone 3 months after each clinic visit .  There was also a follow -up 
contact 30 days after patients stopped taking tafamidis to check for any medical 
problems.  This was an “open -label” study, which means that both the patients and 
researchers knew what medicine was being given.
The figure below shows what happened during this study.

3There was no specific amount of time that patients were required to stay in the study, 
but the time from when the first patient started to when the last patient ended was
about 11 years. The Sponsor ran this study at 9 locations in North America, South 
America, and Europe.  It began 5 August 2009 and ended 8 July 2020. 47 patients 
(51%) were women and 46patients (49%) were men.  All patients were between the 
ages of 26 and 78years old when they started in th isstudy.
Patients could be treated for up to 10 years or until tafamidis became available by 
prescription in their country.  Patients who left the study when they got a prescription 
for tafamidis were called completers. Of the 93 patients who started the study, 
68patients (73%) were completers .  25 patients (27%) left before the study was over 
by their choice or a doctor decided it was best for a patient to stop the study, or 
because they passed away.

4When the study ended in July 2020, the Sponsor began reviewing the information 
collected.  The Sponsor then created a repo rt of the results.  This is a summary of that 
report.
WHAT MEDICAL PROBLEMS DID PATIENTS 
HAVE DURING THE STUDY?
The researchers recorded any medical problems the pa tients had during the study.  
Patients could have had medical problems for reasons not relat ed to the study (for 
example, caused by another illness they have or by chance).  Or, medical problems 
could also have been caused by a study treatment or by another medicine the pa tient
was taking.  Sometimes the cause of a medical problem is unknown.  By comparing 
medical problems across many treatment groups in many studies, doctors try to 
understand what the side effects of an experimental drug might be.
86 out of 93 patients (93%) had at least 1 medical problem, including 35 out of 
38patients (92%) with Val30Met who received tafamidis only in their previous study , 
33 out of 37 patients (89%) with Val30Met who received placebo followed by 
tafamidis in their previous study , and 18 out of 18 patients (100%) without Val30Met 
who received tafamidis in the ir previous study .  
A total of 6 patients (7%) left the study due to medical problems, including 3 patients 
(8%) with Val30Met who received tafamidis in their previous study , 1 patient (3%) 
with Val30Met who received placebo followed by tafamidis in their previous study , 
and 2 patients (11%) without Val30Met who received tafamidis in their previous 
study .  
The most common medical problems are listed below.

WERE THERE ANY SERIOUS MEDICAL 
PROBLEMS?
A medical problem is considered “serious” when it is life -threatening, needs hospital 
care, or causes lasting problems.  
25 out of 93 patients (27%) had at least 1 serious medical problem, including 6 out of 
38 patients (16%) with Val30Met who received ta famidis in their previous study , 9 out 
of 37 patients (24%) with Val30Met who received placebo followed by tafamidis in 
their previous study , and 10 out of 18 patients (56%) without Val30Met who received 
tafamidis in their previous study .
A total of 11 out of 93 patients (12%) died during the study or the follow -up period, 
including 3 patients with Val30Met who received tafamidis in their previous study
(8%), 1 patient with Val30Met who received placebo followed by tafamidis in their 
previous study (3%), an d 7 patients without Val30Met who received tafamidis in their 
previous study (39%).  None of these deaths were considered to be related to 
tafamidis by the study doctors. 
The table below shows the most common serious medical problems.

Overall, the study results suggest that long -term treatment with tafamidis 
20milligrams, taken once per day every day by mouth, was well -tolerated in patients 
with ATTR -PN.  No new safety concerns were identified during this study.
WHAT WERE THE RESULTS OF THE STUDY?
To answer the study questions, the researchers looked at 3 groups of patients.  The 
groups were based on whether patients had the Val30Met mutation and when 
tafamidis was started:
Group 1: 38 patients with the Val30Met mutati on who received tafamidis for 
30months in their previous studies.
Group 2: 37 patients with the Val30Met mutation who received placebo for 
18months followed by 12 months of tafamidis in their previous studies.  A 
placebo does not have any active ingredie nts in it, but it looks just like the study 
drug.
Group 3: 18 patients without the Val30Met mutation who received tafamidis for 
12 months in their previous study.

7In patients with the Val30Met mutation, those in the ta famidis only group 
(Group 1) had less worsening of neuropathy impairment in the legs and feet at 
Month 66, compared to those in the placebo followed by tafamidis group 
(Group 2).  Results show the benefits of earlier treatment with tafamidis.
In patients with the Val30Met mutation, the ability to perform activities of daily 
living (such as personal hygiene and feeding) slightly improved from Month 30 
to Month 66 for those in the tafamidis only group (Group 1).  The ability to 
perform activities of daily living slightly worsened from Month 30 to Month 66 
for those in the placebo followed by tafamidis group (Group 2).
In patients with the Val30Met mutation, the ability to walk worsened more for 
those in the placebo followed by tafamidis group (Gro up 2) at Year 6, 
compared to those in the tafamidis only group (Group 1).  After Year 6, there 
were not enough patients with the Val30Met mutation in the study to draw 
further conclusions on changes in ability to walk.  
In patients with the Val30Met mutat ion who received tafamidis only (Group 1), 
quality of life showed little change from the beginning of the study to 
Month 30, then worsened from Month 30 to Month 66.  In patients with the 
Val30Met mutation who received placebo followed by tafamidis (Group 2), 
quality of life worsened from the beginning of the study to Month 18, then 
improved from Month 42 to Month 66 (after tafamidis was started at 
Month 18).  
After Month 66, there were not enough patients with the Val30Met mutation in 
the study to draw fu rther conclusions about the effects of tafamidis.   
There were no patients without the Val30Met mutation treated with placebo in 
previous studies.  This makes it more difficult to understand the effects of 
tafamidis in Group 3.  Impairment in the lower lim bs, ability to perform 
activities of daily living and quality of life generally worsened over time in 
Group 3. 
In patients without the Val30Met mutation (Group 3), ability to walk worsened 
more quickly at Year 5 compared to those patients with the Val30Me t 
mutation, and did not change further by Year 9.
Over time, patients were able to be prescribed tafamidis by their doctor or left the 
study.  The earlier that patients in this study started taking tafamidis, the more they 
090177e19740fe83\Approved\Approved On: 10-Jun-2021 05:07 (GMT)
8benefited from treatment.  Tafami dis may be an option for treating patients with 
ATTR -PN, and starting tafamidis treatment early may be beneficial.    
This does not mean that everyone in this study had these results.  Other studies may 
produce different results, as well.  These are just some of the main findings of the 
study, and more information may be available at the websites listed at the end of this
