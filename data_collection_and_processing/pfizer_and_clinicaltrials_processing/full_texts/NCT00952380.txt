WHY WAS THIS STUDY DONE?
“Venous thromboembolism”, or VTE, is the name for a blood clot that forms in the 
body. VTE canhappen in a vein located in different parts of the body ,including the 
legs, the arms, the groin, the lungs ,or other parts of the body. A VTE can be 
life-threatening if not treated .
Certain children may be more likely to have a VTE, such as those with cancer or 
other serious conditions that require hospitalization.   VTE may be treated or 
prevented with a type of medicine called an “anticoagulant”, also known as a “blood 
thinner”.  One anticoagulant that is used is called dalteparin.  It is given as an injection 
under the skin.  Dalteparin has been approved for use in adults with VTE in the 
United States and Europe , but has not be en approved in children because additional 
studies are needed to find out if dalteparin could be a useful medicine for children.
The main purpose of this study was to learn more about the use of dalteparin in 
children with or without cancer , and to help de termine the appropriate dose of 
dalteparin for treating VTE in children.  The study doctors collected blood samples 
from the children and did a blood test  to find out what the “anti -Xa level” was after 
certain doses of dalteparin were given.  The Anti -Xa level  shows how well dalteparin 
makes blood clots go away or stops a blood clot from forming.
Specifically, the study doctors wanted to answer these questions:
What effect would dalteparin, given at different doses, have on the 
bodies of children, includi ng children with cancer and children without 
cancer? 
What would be the average dalteparin dose required to treat VTE in 
children, based on age and weight?
How long did it take the children’s anti -Xa test results to reach target 
levels ?
WHAT HAPPENED DURING THE STUDY?
This study was done to learn more abou t the use of dalteparin in children who have a 
VTE.   The children who entered the study had to have VTE, and may also have had a 
090177e1906a44c9\Approved\Approved On: 22-Feb-2019 06:22 (GMT)type of cancer.  
First, the children were checked by the study doctor to make sure they were a good fit 
for the study.  This was called “screening”.  
The children were grouped by age:
Group 1 ( 1 child ): 0 weeks old to less than 8 weeks old
Group 2 ( 2children): At least 8 weeks old, but less than 2 years old
Group 3 ( 8children): At least 2 years old, but less than 8 years old
Group 4 ( 7child ren): At least 8years old, but less than 1 2 years old
Group 5 ( 20children): At least 12 years old, but less than 19 years old
This was an “open label” study, which means that the children, their 
parents/guardians, and the study doctors knew which medicine the children received 
during the study. In this study, all children received dalteparin.
There w ere 3 phases to this study.  Phase 1 was known as the “do se adjustment 
phase”.  This phase started when the child received their first (starting) dose of study 
medicine and continued for up to 7 days.  
The starting dose depended on the age and weight of thechild, as follows:
Group 1: 125 IU per kilogram (kg) o f weight  
Group 2: 150 IU per kg of weight  
Group 3: 125 IU per kg of weight  
Group 4 :125 IU per kg of weight  
Group 5 :100 IU per kg of weight  
Then, d uring this 7 -day “dose adjustment phase”, the study doctors tested the child’s 
anti-Xa levels.  Each child’s dalteparin dose was adjusted (upward or downward) ,as 
needed, until the child’s anti -Xa test result was between 0.5 and 1.0 (the “target ”
range).  The dose that put the child ’s anti -Xa level into that target range is called the 
“maintenance dose”. This is the dose that would be used going forward, in order to 
keep the child’s anti -Xa level within the target range. 
Once the children had reached the target anti -Xa level, they entered Phase 2 of the 
090177e1906a44c9\Approved\Approved On: 22-Feb-2019 06:22 (GMT)study.  Phase 2 was known as the “pharmacodynamics phase” , and it lasted between
1and7 days (enough time to collect 2 blood samples from each child).  During this 
time, children received their maintenance dose from Phase 1, given every 12 hours.  
After they completed Phase 2, the children entered Phase 3 of the study.  Phase 3 was 
known as the “follow -up phase” , and it lasted until the end of the study.  The children 
continued receiving their maintenance dose of dalteparin, given every 12 hours. The 
study doctors tested the children’s blood to make sure anti -Xa was still within the
target range (0.5 to 1.0) .  
The figure below shows what happened during this study.
While children were only in the study for up to 90 days , the entire study took a lmost
9years to complete.  The sponsor ran this study at 15 locations in Norway, Russia, 
Slovenia, Spain, and the United States.  It began 20August 2009and finished  
20March 2018.  A total of 14 girls and 24boys participated   All children were 
between the ages of 0and 1 8years old .
The study required the children to come to a total of 7 visits at the study center. Of 
the 38children who were treated in the study, 26children (68%) completed all of the 
090177e1906a44c9\Approved\Approved On: 22-Feb-2019 06:22 (GMT)study visits .  At total of 12children (32%) did not finish the study , either due to 
medical problems or by their parent /guardian ’s choice.   
When the study ended in March 2018, the Sponsor began reviewing the information 
collected .  The Sponsor then created a report of the results. This is a summar y of that 
report.
WHAT WERE THE RESULTS OF THE STUDY? 
What effect did dalteparin, given at different doses, have on 
the bodies of children, including children with cancer and 
children without cancer? 
To answer this question, the researchers looked at the children’s anti -Xa levels.  Most 
of the children in this study were able to reach target anti -Xa levels.  However, the 
younger children needed a higher dose of dalteparin to reach these levels, compared 
to the older children.  For instance, children from Group 2 needed an average dose of 
207.5 IU per kg of weight, while children from Group 4 needed an average dose of 
116.7 IU per kg of weight.
What was the average dose of dalteparin required to treat 
VTE in children, based on age and weight? 
To answer thi s question, the researchers looked for the average dose of dalteparin 
needed to reach anti -Xa target levels in each age group.  The average doses needed 
were as follows:
Group 2: 207 .5IU per kg of weight
Group 3: 128.15 IU per kg of weight
Group 4: 125 IU per kg of weight
Group 5: 116.7 IU per kg of weight
There was only 1 child in Group 1, and this child did not reach the anti -Xa target level 
during the study.  Therefore, the researchers were not able to determine the average 
dose needed to reach anti -Xa target levels (treat VTE) for this age group. 
090177e1906a44c9\Approved\Approved On: 22-Feb-2019 06:22 (GMT)How  long did it take the children’s anti -Xa test results to 
reach target levels ?
To answer this question, the researchers measured how long it took for the children’s 
anti-Xa tests results to reach levels betw een 0.5 and 1.0, which was the target range.
On average, it took 2.6 days for the children’s anti -Xa tests results to reach this range.
This does not mean that everyone in this study had these results.  Other studies may 
produce different results, as well .  These are just some of the main findings of the 
study, and more information may be available at the websites listed at the end of this 
summary.  
WHAT MEDICAL PROBLEMS DID CHILDREN
HAVE DURING THE STUDY?
The researchers recorded any medical problems the participants had during the study.
Participants could have had medical problems for reasons not related to the study (for 
example, caused by an underlying disease or by chance).  Or, medical problems could 
also have been caused by a study treatment, or b y another medicine the participant 
was taking.  Sometimes the cause of a medical problem is unknown.  By comparing 
medical problems across many treatment groups in many studies, doctors try to 
understand what the side effects of an experimental drug might be.
If any new medical problems arose during the study, these were reported by the study 
doctors.  In addition, if a preexisting medical problem worsened, these would also be 
reported.  
Out of 38children in this study , 33child ren(87%) had a t least 1 medical problem .  
The most common medical problems are listed below.

WERE THERE ANY SERIOUS MEDICAL 
PROBLEMS?
A medical problem is considered “serious” when it is life -threatening, needs hospital 
care, or causes lasting problems .  
Out of 38 children in this study, 21 children (55%) had  new serious medical problem s 
that were diagnosed during the study .  One child passed away during the study .  The 
study doctor determined that this child passed away due to a condition that was 
present before t he study started and not related to taking dalteparin.
