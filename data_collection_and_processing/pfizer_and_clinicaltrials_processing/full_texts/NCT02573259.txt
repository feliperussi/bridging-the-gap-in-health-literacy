Why was this study done?
What is Sasanlimab?
Sasanlimab (sah -SAN -lih-mab) is a new experimental drug for cancer treatment that is 
currently not approved for sale or for use outside of a clinical trial.  Sasanlimab is a 
type of medicine called an “antibody”.  Antibodies are special proteins made by the 
immune system that recognize and stick to specific proteins on the surface of germs 
or cells.  Sasanlimab recognizes a protein called “PD -1” that is located on your 
immune cells.  Sasanlimab blocks P D-1 from interacting with another protein, 
“PD-L1”, located on the surface of tumors.  Blocking this interaction may help the 
immune system slow or stop the growth of cancer cells.
What was the purpose of this study?
This study was divided into 2 parts.  The main purpose of Part 1 of this study was to 
learn about the safety of sasanlimab, and to find the best dose of sasanlimab to use to 
treat cancer in Phase 2 trials. To do this, the researchers asked,
What medical p roblems did participants have while taking sasanlimab?
What dose -limiting toxicities (DLTs) did participants have when taking 
sasanlimab?
DLTs are certain medical problems caused by taking sasanlimab ,which require the 
patient to lower the dose or stop tak ing the medicine temporarily or permanently.  
These medical problems could also stop the use of the drug at that dosage in all 
patients.
The main purpose of Part 2 of this study was to learn more about the safety of 
sasanlimab, and to measure if any of the patients’ cancer got better during the study.  
To do this, the researchers asked,
What medical problems did participants have while taking sasanlimab?
How many participants had their cancer get better when taking 
sasanlimab?

What happened during the study? 
How was the study done?
During Part 1, researchers tested different doses of sasanlimab on a group of 
participants with solid tumors to learn about the safety of sasanlimab and find the 
best dose of sasanlimab to treat cancer in future trials.  Participants were given 
sasanlimab either by infusion into a vein (intravenously, or “IV”) at a dose of 0.5 to 
10 mg/kg of body weight every 21 days, or 300 mg of sasanlimab by injection under 
the skin (subcutaneously, or “SC”) every 28 days.  
During Part 2, researchers tested a group of p articipants with either non -small cell 
lung cancer (“NSCLC”) or cancer of the lining of the urinary tract (urothelial cancer, 
or “UC”) to learn more about the safety of sasanlimab.  They also measured the size 
of the participants’ tumors to see if their ca ncer got better or worse during treatment.  
Participants were given 300 mg of sasanlimab SC every 28 days.
This study was “open -label”, meaning that the doctors and participants knew what 
treatment they were being given.  The study design is shown in the g raphics on the 
next page.Researchers wanted to know:
What medical problems did patients have while taking 
sasanlimab?
What dose -limiting toxicities (DLTs) did patients have when 
taking sasanlimab in Part 1 of the study?
How many patients had their cancer get better when taking 
sasanlimab in Part 2 of the st udy?

When did this study take place?
It began on 10 February 2016 and ended on 19 November 2020 .
Who participated in this study?
Part 1 of the study included adult participants who were diagnosed with certain types 
of solid tumors of the skin, head and neck, ovaries, connective tissues, lungs, or lining 
of the urinary tract that was locally advanced (the cancer had grown outside of the 
organ it had started in but had not yet spread to distant parts of the body) or 
metastatic (spread to distant parts of the body).  
Part 2 of the study included adult participants who were diagnosed with either 
non-small cel l lung cancer (NSCLC) or urothelial carcinoma (UC) that was locally 
advanced or metastatic (spread to other parts of the body).
A total of 12 men participated in Part 1 and 78 men participated in Part 2
A total of 28 women each participated in Part 1 and P art 2
All participants were between the ages of 26 and 88
Of the 40 participants who started Part 1 of the study and received sasanlimab , 
1finished treatment and 6 finished the study.  Of the 106 participants who started 
Part 2 of the study and received sasanlimab, 10 finished treatment and 15 finished the 
study.  The most common reason for participants stopping treatment during Part 1 or 
Part 2 was because their cancer got worse, and the most common reason for leaving 
the study was because the participant passed away.  
How long did the study last?
Study participants received an average of 12 cycles of treatment in Part 1 of the study, 
and 9 cycles of treatment in Part 2 of the study.  The entire study took 4 years and 
9months to complete.
When the study ended in November 2020, the Sponsor reviewed the information 
collected.  The Sponsor then created a report of the results.  This is a summar y of that 
report.

What were the results of the study?
Were any dose -limiting toxicities (DLTs) reported during Part 1 of 
the study?
No DLTs were reported in the 40 participants treated with sasanlimab during Part 1 
of the study.  
How many participants had their cancer get better when taking 
sasanlimab during Part 2 of the study?
To answer this, the researchers measured the “Objective Response Rate”, which is the 
percentage of participants whose cancer got better (their tumor shrank or 
disappeared) during P art 2 of the study.  They also recorded the percentage of 
participants whose cancer stayed the same or got worse.  The results are shown in the 
graph on the next page.

How many participants had their cancer get better when taking 
sasanlimab during Part 2 of the study?
A total of 16% of participants with NSCLC and 18% of participants with UC 
had their cancer get better during Part 2 of this study.  In addition, 40% of 
participants with NSCLC and 34% of participants with UC had their cancer 
stay the same d uring Part 2 of this study. 
This does not mean that everyone in this study had these results.  This is a summary 
of just some of the main results of this study.  Other studies may have different 
results.

What medical problems did participants have during 
the study?
The researchers recorded any medical problems the participants had during the study.  
Participants could have had medical problems for reasons not related to the study (for 
example, caused by an underlying disease or by chance).  Or, medi cal problems could 
also have been caused by a study treatment or by another medicine the participant was 
taking.  Sometimes the cause of a medical problem is unknown.  By comparing 
medical problems across many treatment groups in many studies, doctors try to 
understand what effects a study medication might have on a participant.
A total of 3 9out of 40 (9 8%) participants in Part 1 and 98out of 106 ( 93%) 
participants in Part 2 of this study had at least 1 medical problem.  A total of 
1participant in Part 1 and 11 participants in Part 2 stopped taking the study treatment 
because of medical problems.  The most common medical problems –those reported 
by more than 10% of participants in Part 1 or Part 2 –are described in the table on 
the next page.
Instruc tions for Understanding Table 1 and Table 2. 
The 1stcolumn of Table 1 lists medical problems that were commonly reported 
during the study.  All medical problems reported by more than 10% of 
participants are listed.  Table 2 lists serious medical problems reported by more 
than 1 participant during the study.
The 2ndand 3rdcolumns tellhow many of the participants taking the study 
medication in Part 1 or Part 2 reported each medical problem.  Next to this 
number is the percentage of the participants takin g the study medication who 
reported the medical problem.
Using these instructions, you can see in Table 1 that 9 out of the 40 participants 
(23%) taking sasanlimab in Part 1 of the study reported a low blood cell count.

Did study participants have any serious medical 
problems?
A medical problem is considered “serious” when it is life-threatening, needs hospital 
care, or causes lasting problems.
A total of 13 out of 40 participants (33%) had serious medical problems in Part 1.  A 
total of 31 out of 106 participants ( 29%) had serious medical problems in Part 2.  Most 
were not thought to be related to the study treatment.  A total of 28 out of 
40participants (70%) in Part 1 and 54 out of 106 participa nts (51%) in Part 2 passed 
away during the study, mostly due to the participants’ cancer getting worse. 
The serious medical problems reported by more than 1 participant during the study are 
shown in Table 2 on the next page.
