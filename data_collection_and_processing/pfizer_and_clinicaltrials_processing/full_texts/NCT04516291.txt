–Thank You –
If you participated in this study, Pfizer, the Sponsor, would like to thank you for your 
participation.
This summary will describe the study results. If you have any questions about the 
study or the results, please contact the doctor or staff at your study site.Why was this st udy done?
What is dyslipidemia?
Dyslipidemia is a condition in which the blood has an abnormal level of lipids (or fats) 
called cholesterol and triglycerides (TG).  Levels of one or both lipids can be 
abnormal in dyslipidemia.  High levels of cholesterol or TG increase the risk for heart 
disease (heart attack) or stroke.  This is because fatty deposits in the blood vessels can 
build up and block the blood flow from the heart.
There are different types of cholesterol , which have different effects on the body.  
Non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (non -HDL -C) can tell how much 
cholesterols there are in the blood that can lead to heart disease or stroke .  Ahigh 
level of non -HDL -C means a higher risk of heart disease or stroke.
What is vupanorsen?
Vupanors en is an injectable study medicine given through a needle inserted under the 
skin.  It has not been approved for general use at the time of this study.
Researchers think that vupanorsen can lower the levels of non -HDL -Cand TG in the 
blood.  Researchers also think that taking vupanorsen for a longer period of time 
could help to lower the risk of heart disease.
What was the purpose of this study?
This study aimed to learn about the effects of vupanorsen after 24weeks on the:
Levels of non -HDL -C and TG in the blood
Amount of fat in the liverResearchers wanted to know:
1.Did participants have a lower level of non -HDL -C after taking 
vupanorsen for 24 weeks?
2.Did participants have a lower level of TG after taking 
vupanorsen for 24 weeks?
3.Did participants have a change in the amount of liver fat after 
taking vupanorsen for 24 weeks?
What happened during the study?
How was the study done?
In this study, researchers tested 7 doses of vupanorsen on a group of participants.  
Researchers then compared the results of participants taking vupanorsen to the results 
of participants taking a placebo.  A placebo does not have any medicine in it, but it 
looks just like vupanorsen.
This was a “double -blind” study.  This means the partic ipants and researchers did not 
know which treatment the participants got.
Throughout the study, participants continued to take their statin medicine .  Statins
belong to a class of medicine that lowers the cholesterol levels in the blood.
On Day 1 of the st udy, participants got assigned to a treatment group by 
chance, and they took their first dose of study treatment (vupanorsen or 
placebo).
Participants then continued to take their assigned study treatment for 
24weeks .  They took the study treatment either at home or at the study site.
Participants returned to the study site for a follow -up visit 12 weeks after their 
last dose.Figure 1.  What happened during the study?
Figure 2.  What were the treatment groups?
Where did this study take place?
The Sponsor ran this study at 55 study sites in 3 countries (Canada, Poland, and 
United States of America) .
When did this study take place?
It began 28 September 2020 and ended 06 December 2021 .
Who participated in this study?
The study included participan ts who were 40 years old or above, had abnormal levels 
of cholesterol and TG in the blood , and were on a stable dose of a statin.  The study 
did not allow those who had medical conditions such as an active liver disease or high 
blood pressure that could notbe controlled with treatment .
In total, 160 men and 126 women joined the study.  All participants were between the 
ages of 40 and 88 years.
Participants were to be treated for24 weeks.  Of the 286 participants who started the 
study, 226 finished the t reatment period.
Sixty (60) participants did not finish the treatment period.  The most common reason 
was because of a medical problem they had during the study.  Other reasons were:
A study doctor decided it was best for a participant to stop being in the study.
Participants left by their choice before the study was over.
Participants took medicines that were not allowed during the study.
How long did the study last?
Participants were in the study for about 36 weeks. The entire study took about 1 year 
and 2 months to finish .
When the study ended in December 2021, the Sponsor began reviewing the 
information collected.  The Sponsor then created a report of the results.  This is a 
summary of that report.
What were the results of the study?
To answer the first 2 questions, r esearchers looked at the participants’ blood test 
results during the study to see the levels of non -HDL -C and TG.Did participants have a lower level of non -HDL -C after 
taking vupanorsen for 24 weeks?
Yes. Researchers found that participants had a lower level of non -HDL -C after 
taking vupanorsen for 24 weeks compared to before starting treatment (baseline).
Then, researchers looked at how much the levels of non -HDL -C decreased at 
24weeks compared to baseline.  This is called the “percent decrease from baseline” in 
non-HDL -C.
Did vupanorsen lower the level of non -HDL -C compared to 
placebo?
Yes.  Researchers found a larger percent decrease from baseline in non -HDL -C 
among participants who took vupanorsen (all tested doses) for 24 weeks compared 
to those who took placebo.  Researchers found that the results are not likely due to 
chance.  The tested doses of vupanorsen may help to lower the level of 
non-HDL -C in the blood.
Figure 3.  How much was the percent decrease from baseline in the level of 
non-HDL -C after 24 weeks of treatment?
1Did participants have a lower level of TG after taking 
vupanorsen for 24 weeks?
Yes. Researchers found that participants had a lower level of TG after taking 
vupanorsen for 24 weeks compared to baseline.
Did vupanorsen lower the level of TG compared to placebo?
Yes.  Researchers found a larger percent decrease from baseline in TG among 
participants who took vupanorsen (all tested doses) for 24 weeks compared to those 
who took placebo.  Researchers found that the results are not likely due to chance.  
The tested doses of vupanorsen may help to lower the level of TG in the blood.
Figure 4.  How much was the percent decrease from baseline in the level of 
TG after 24 weeks of treatment?
To answer the 3rd question, participants had a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) 
scan to measure the amount of liver fat.  They had an MRI scan at baseline and after 
taking study treatment for 24 w eeks.
2Did participants have a change in the amount of liver fat 
after taking vupanorsen for 24 weeks?
Yes.  Researchers found an increased amount of liver fat among participants who 
took the higher tested doses of vupanorsen for 24 weeks compared to baseline.
Did vupanorsen change the amount of liver fat compared to 
placebo?
Yes.  Compared to those who took placebo, researchers found a larger percent 
increase from baseline in the amount of liver fat among participants who took the 
higher tested doses of vupanorsen for 24 weeks. These doses of vupanorsen were:
120 mg once a month
80 mg once every 2 weeks
160 mg once a month120 mg once every 2 weeks
160 mg once every 2 weeks
Figure 5.  How much was the percent change in the amount of liver fat after 
24 weeks of treatment?
The results in this summary do not mean that everyone in this study had these results.  
This is a summary of just some of the main results of this study , and it describes the 
average results .  Other studies with vupanorsen may have different results.
3What medical problems did participants have during 
the study?
The researchers recorded any medical problems the participants had during the study.  
Participants could have had medical problems for reasons not related to the study (f or 
example, caused by an underlying disease or by chance). Or, medical problems could 
also have been caused by a study treatment or by another medicine the participant was 
taking. Sometimes the cause of a medical problem is unknown. By comparing 
medical problems across many treatment groups in many studies, doctors try to 
understand what effects a study medication might have on a participant.
Overall, 195 out of 286 participants (68%) in this study had at least 1 medical 
problem.  A total of 42 out of 286 participants (15%) stopped taking the study 
treatment because of a medical problem they had during the study.
Table 1 lists the most common medical problems –those reported by at least 10% of 
participants in any group.
Below are instructions on how to read Table 1.
Instructions for Understanding Table 1
Table 1 lists the most common medical problems that were reported during the 
study.  It lists all medical problems reported by at least 10% of participants in any 
group.
The 1stcolumn tells how many of the 44 participants taking placebo reported each 
medical problem.  Next to this number is the percentage of the 44 participants 
taking placebo who reported the medical problem.
The 2ndto 8thcolumns tell how many participants taking different doses of 
vupanorsen reported each medical problem.  The 2ndcolumn tells how many of 
the 23 participants taking vupanorsen 80 mg once a month reported each medical 
problem.  Next to this number is the percentage of the 23 participants taking 
vupanorsen 80 mg once a m onth who reported the medical problem.
Using these instructions, you can see that 1 out of the 23 participants (4%) taking 
vupanorsen 80 mg once a month reported redness over the injection area.  None of 
the 44 participants (0%) taking a placebo reported r edness over the injection area.Table 1.  Most common medical problems in the study

Did study participants have any serious medical 
problems?
A medical problem is considered “serious” when it is life -threatening, needs hospital 
care, or causes lasting problems.
Overall, 19 out of 286 participants (7%) had a serious medical problem during the 
study.  The list below shows the most common serious medical problems reported by 
at least 2 participants in the total group .
2 participants who took vupanorsen 80 mg once every 2 weeks had a medi cal 
condition that got worse.
oNarrow ing of spaces within the spine in 1 participant
oBrain tumor in 1 participant
1 participant who took placebo and 1 participant who took vupanorsen 60 mg 
once every 2 weeks had a urinary tract infection (UTI).The study doctors did not think any of the serious medical problems were caused by 
the study treatment.  There were other serious medical problems across the treatment 
groups, but these happened in fewer participants.
No participant died during the study.
