CLINICAL TRIAL RESULTS
This summary reports the results of only one study.  Researchers must look at the 
results of many types of studies to understand if a study medicine works, how it 
works, and if it is safe to prescribe to patients.  The results of this study might be 
different than the results of other studies that the researchers review.

2WHY WAS THIS STUDY DONE?
Atopic dermatitis (or “AD”) ,which is also sometimes called atopic eczema, is a 
common skin disorder that causes patches of flaky, red , and very itchy skin .  AD 
occurs in 15 %-30% of children and 10% of adults in the United States .  Some of the 
current medicines available for AD can only be used for short time periods ,or can cause 
other health problems .  Researchers are looking for new treatments for AD that can be 
taken for long periods of time . 
While researchers think that many things cause AD, it is made worse by the body’s 
immune system (the body’s defense against infection) causing redness and swelling 
(inflammation ).  Cells in the immune system cause inflammation by making special 
proteins called “cytokines”.  Researchers think that medicines that lower the amount 
of cytokines that the body makes could help treat patients with AD . 
The drug tested in this study was PF-04965842 , which now has the generic name 
abrocitinib.  PF-04965842 is an experimental drug that has not been approved for sale 
yet.  PF-04965842 blocks the activity of a protein called “Janus kinase 1”, which acts like 
an on/off switch for the cells of the immune system.  By turning off this switch, the 
cells of the immune system are expected to produce fewer cytokines thatare believed to 
make AD worse .  The researchers wanted to ask,
Arepatients who take PF -04965842 more likel y to have their AD improve
compared to patients who are treated with a placebo ?  
To do this, researchers used 2 different teststo measure the severity of each patient’s 
ADat the beginning of the study .The researchers measured the severity of AD during
12 weeks of study treatment.  The difference in severity was used to decide if a patient’s 
AD had improved or not.

3WHAT HAPPENED DURING THE STUDY?
This study compared 3groups of patients to find out if more patients taking 
PF-04965842 had their AD improve compared to patients taking a placeb o.  A 
placebo d oes not have any medicine in it, but it looks just likethe study medicine.
The study included adult men and women, and boys and girls who were aged 12 years 
and older.  Patients included in the study:
Had chronic (long -term) ADfor at least 1 year , and had moderate to severe 
AD when they entered the study.
Also h ad one of the following :
oHad been treated up to 6 months earlier for ADwith medici nes 
applied to the skin , and their ADdid not get better;
oWere unable to use medicines on the skin because of a medical 
problem ;
oNeeded to use medicines that reach all parts of the body to control 
their AD (for example, taking medicines by mouth).
The pati ents and docto rs did not know who took PF-04965842 and who took the 
placebo.  This is known as a “ double -blinded” study.  This is done to make sure the 
results of the research study cannot be unfairly influenced by anyone .  Patient s were 
assigned to 1of 3 treatment group sby chance (like the flip of a coin or drawing straws) 
to receive either PF -04965842 at a dose of 100 mg, PF -04965842 at a dose of 200 mg or 
placebo.  Patients had an 80% (4 out of 5) chance of receiving PF -04965842 and a 
20% (1 out of 5) chance of receiving placebo. This is known as a “randomized” study.

4This study used 2 different tests to measure the severity of the patients’ AD at the 
beginning of the study and throughout 12 weeks of treatment.  The first testis called 
the Inv estigators Global Assessment (IGA) scale andmeasures the severity of AD on 
a 5-point scale (0 being the best and 4 being the worst ).  The second testis called the 
Eczema Area and Severity Index ,andmeasures how severe a patient’s AD is based on 
4 different signs , as well as the amount of skin affected by AD. The difference in 
each patient ’s score between the start of t he study and after 12 weeks of treatment 
was used to decide if their AD had improved.
While patients were only in the s tudy for 12 to 16 weeks , the entire study took 15 
months to complete.  The Sponsor ran this study at 69locations in 8countries in 
North America, Europe, and Australia .  It began 07December 2017 and ended 
26March 2019.  A total of 167 women or girls and 220men or boys participated.  All 
patients were between the ages of 12and 84. 
Patients were to be treated until the end of the 12 week treatment period .  Of the 
387patients who started the study, 333finished the study .  25patients did not finish 
the study because of medical problems. 13patients left before the study was over by

5their choice or their parent’s choice, or a doctor decided it was best for a patient to 
stop being in the study.
When the study ended in March 2019 as pla nned , the Sponsor began reviewing the 
information collected.  The Sponsor then created a report of the results. This is a 
summary of that report.
WHAT WERE THE RESULTS OF THE STUDY?
Were patients who t ookPF-04965842 more likely to have their AD 
improve compared to patients who took a placebo?
In this study, more patients in the PF-04965842 100mg or 200 mg treatment groups
had their AD improve ,compared to theplacebo group .  
When the change in severity of AD was measured using the IGA scale, 37out of 156
patients (24%)in the PF-04965842 100mg treatment group and 67out of 153 
patients (44%)in the PF-04965842 200mg treatment group had their AD improve to 
‘clear’ or ‘almost clear’ (score of 0 or 1) after 12 weeks.  In comparison, 6out of 
76patients (8%)in the placebo group had their AD improve to ‘clear’ or ‘almost clear’ 
after 12 weeks. 
When the change in severity of AD was measured using the Eczema Area and 
Severity Index, 62out of 156 patients (40%)in the PF -04965842 100mg treatment
group and 96out of 153patients (63%)in the PF -04965842 200mg treatment group
had their AD improve by at least 75% after 12 weeks.  In comparison, 9out of 
76patients (12%)in the placebo group had their AD improve by at least 75% after 
12weeks.  
These results are also shown in graph son the next page.

6Based on these results, the researchers have decided that the results are not likely the 
result of chance.  PF-04965842 may be an option for treating AD in adults and 
children 12 years and older .
This does not mean that everyone in this study had these results.  Other studies may 
produce different results , as well .  These are just some of the main findings of the 
study, and more information may be available at the websites listed at the end of this
summary.

7WHAT MEDICAL PROBLEMS DID 
PARTICIPANTS HAVE DURING THE STUDY?
The researchers recorded any medical problems the participants had during the study.
Participants could have had medical problems for reasons not related to the study (for 
example, caused by an underlying disease or by chance). Or, medical problems could 
also have been caused by a study treatment or by another medicine the participant wa s 
taking. Sometimes the cause of a medical problem is unknown. By comparing 
medical problems across many treatment groups in many studies, doctors try to 
understand what the side effects of an experimental drug might be.
272out of 387patients in this s tudy had at least 1 medical problem.  A total of 
25patients left the study because of medical problems.  The most common medical 
problems are listed below.

WERE THERE ANY SERIOUS MEDICAL 
PROBLEMS?
A medical problem is considered “serious” when it is life -threatening, needs hospital 
care, or causes lasting problems.  
A total of 13patients ( 3%, or 3 out of 100 patients)had serious medical problems
during this study.  Of these ,2patients had a t least 1serious medical problem that was
possibly related to taking the medicines in the study .  The serious medical problems 
that were reported for more than 1 patient were 2patients who developed 
appendicitis (1patient in the PF-04965842 100 mggroup, and 1patient in the placebo 
group ) and 2patients in the PF -04965842 200 mg group who experienced asthma.  
No patients died during the study.
