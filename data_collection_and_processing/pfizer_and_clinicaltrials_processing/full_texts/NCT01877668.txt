2WHY WAS THIS STUDY DONE?
Psoriatic arthritis (also known as “PsA”) is a disease that can cause pain and swelling 
(inflammation) in or around the joints, tendon areas, fingers, toes, and back, and is 
often combined with itchy, scaly rashes on the skin .  These problems are because the 
immune system, whose job is to attack foreign invaders like viruses and other germs, 
mistakenly attacks other parts of the body instead.  
If PsA inflammation is left untreated, joints, tendon areas , fingers, and toes may 
become painful or swollen; skin rashes may occur; and people may become extremely 
tired.  There is no cure for PsA at this time, but common treatments for PsA include 
medicines that control pain, reduce inflammation, and prevent the immune system 
from attacking the joints. 
Tofacitinib is a medicine that may reduce the activity of the immune system.  It is an 
oral (taken by mouth) medication used to treat adults with PsA.  In this study, 
researchers wantedto learn more about the use of tofacitinib in people who ha dnot 
been helped by conventional synthetic disease -modifying anti -rheumatic drugs 
(csDMARDs) like methotrexate, which were being used to treat Ps A.  
Researchers did this study to find out if tofactinib, when compared to placebo, in 
patients on background therapy of csDMARD, reduced PsA symptoms and improved 
a patient’s ability to perform physical activities (improved physical functioning).  
Researchers wanted to answer th isquestion:  
Does tofacitinib help reduce pain, inflammation, and other symptoms caused 
by PsA in patients that were not helped by other drugs (csDMARDs) 
previously being used to treat PsA?
WHAT HAPPENED DURING THE STUDY?
This study compared 5 groups of patients to find out if patients who took tofacitinib 
had an improve ment in PsA symptoms and physical functioning, compared to 
patients who took placebo.  A placebo does not have any medicine in it, but looks just 
like the medicine being tested .  Using a placebo helps researchers learn if the study

3drug works better than n o treatment at all.  In this study, all patients (including those 
taking placebo) received 1 csDMARD as background therapy; thus, patients taking 
placebo did take some medicine in this study.  Background therapy is the standard 
treatment routinely used to treat a disease or condition.
In this study, some patients were given adalimumab, which is a medication that is 
used to treat PsA.  Adalimumab is a biologic DMARD (bDMARD) and has been 
shown to reduce pain and inflammation in patients with PsA.  
Researche rs also wanted to find out if patients who took adalimumab, an active 
control, had an improvement in the same symptoms and functioning compared to 
patients who took placebo.  An active control is a drug that is already being used to 
treat patients with the disease being studied.  In this study, the active control was 
tested against placebo to see if the standard treatment available to patients worked 
better than no treatment at all.
This study included adult men and women who:
Had active psoriatic arthritis for more than 6 months;
Had active plaque psoriasis (skin lesions) that had been diagnosed or confirmed 
by adoctor;
Had 3 or more swolle n joints and 3 or more tender (painful to the touch) 
joints ;
Were not helped by at least 1 csDMARD (like methotrexate) for the treatment 
of psoriatic arthritis.
All patients were taking a medication to treat their PsA that was prescribed by their 
doctors before they entered the study.  At the start of the study, these patients 
continued to take the pre scribed medication and were also assigned by chance alone 
to receive some combination of tofacitinib, placebo , or a dalimumab in 1 of 5 different 
orders (treatment sequences).  This is known as a “randomized” study.  This is done 
to make the groups more sim ilar.  Reducing differences between the groups (like age 
or the number of men and women), makes the groups more even to compare.
This trial was also “double -blinded”.  This means that patients and doctors did not 
know who was given which treatment/medicin e.  This was done to make sure that the 
trial results were not influenced in any way .

4The study had two parts: Part 1, which lasted for 3 months; and Part 2, which lasted 
for 9 months.  Some patients received the same treatment in both parts of the study, 
but some patients received a different treatment in Part 2 than they received in Part 1.  
Patients were randomized to receive some combination of tofacitinib, placebo, or 
adalimumab in 1 of 5 different sequences:
Medicines Given in Each Treatment Sequence
Treatment 
Sequence Part 1 (3 months) Part 2 (9 months)
ATofacitinib 5 milligrams (mg) tablets 
twice a day (BID) plus placebo 
injection once every 2 weeks Same as Part 1
BTofacitinib 10 mg tablets BID plus 
placebo injection once every 2 weeksSame as Part 1
CAdalimumab injection (40 mg) once 
every 2 weeks plus placebo tablets 
BIDSame as Part 1
DPlacebo tablets BID plus placebo

injection once every 2 weeks
EPlacebo tablets BID plus placebo 
injection once every 2 weeksTofacitinib 10 mg BID plus placebo 
injection once every 2 weeks
All patients were required to receive 1 csDMARD (like methotrexate) during the study.
Patients were checked (screened) to make sure they were a good fit for the study.  A 
total of 422 patients who met all the study requirements were randomized to receive 
tofacitinib, placebo, or adalimumab in 1 of 5 different treatment sequences.

5Whilepatients wer e only in the study for 12 months, the entire study took about 
2yearsto complete.  The Sponsor ran this study at 94 locations in Australia, Canada, 
Mexico, Russian Federation, Taiwan, the United Kingdom, the United States, and 
throughout Europe.  It began on 20 January 2014 and ended on 18 December 2015.  
A total of 225 women (53%) and 197 men (47%) participated.  All pati ents were 
between the ages of 18 and 81 years . 
Patients were to be treated for 12 months.  Of the 422patients who started the study, 
373(88%) finished the whole study .  A total o f 49patients (12%) left before the study 
was over by their choice or because a doctor decided it was best for them to stop the 
study.
When the study ended in December 2015, the Sponsor began reviewing the study 
results .  The Sponsor then cr eated a report of the results.  This is a summary of that 
report.

6WHAT WERE THE RESULTS OF THE STUDY?
Does tofacitinib reduce joint pain and inflammation in 
patients who were not helped by csDMARDs (like 
methotrexate) ?
Yes.  In this study, tofacitinib red uced joint pain and inflammation in patients who 
were not helped by csDMARDs.  
Researchers looked at the percentage of patients (number of patients out of 100) in 
each treatment group who had at least a 20% reduction in the number of joints that 
were tend er/painful and swollen (inflamed) after 3 months of taking study drug.  
They compared the number of tender/painful and swollen joints that patients had at 
the end of the 3 months of treatment to the number of tender/painful and swollen 
joints that patients had before they started the study, to see if tofacitinib reduced pain 
and inflammation.
More patients in both tofacitinib groups (5 mg and 10 mg) had less joint pain and 
inflammation at the end of 3 months of treatment than patients in the placebo group. 
Half of the patients taking 5 mg tofacitinib (50%; 5 out of every 10 patients) and over 
half of the patients taking 10 mg tofacitinib (61%; 6 out of every 10 patients) had less 
pain and inflammation than they had before they started treatment.  One -third (33%) 
of the patients taking placebo had a reduction in joint pain and inflammation 
compared to their pain and inflammation before treatment.

7Does tofacitinib improve a patient’s ability to complete 
activities of daily living ?
Yes, patients had an easier time completing daily activities after taking tofacitinib.
Researchers asked patients how difficult it was to complete daily living activities, such 
as dressing and grooming, getting up, eating, walking, and bathing.  They used a 
questionnaire that asked patients to rate their level of difficulty completing an activity 
on a scale ranging from “no difficulty completing activity” (a score of 0) to “unable to 
complete activity” (a score of 3).  Researchers then compared the patients ’ responses 
after taking tofacitinib or placebo to their responses before they started study 
treatment.

8On average, p atients who took tofacitinib (5 mg and 10 mg) had a greater 
improvement in how easy it was to complete daily activities than patients takin g 
placebo.  At the end of 3 months of treatment, the questionnaire score (amount of 
difficulty completing activities) decreased by an average of  0.35 (out of 3) for p atients 
who took tofacitinib 5 mg twice daily, 0.40 (out of 3) for p atients who took tofacitinib 
10 mg twice daily, and 0.18 (out of 3) for p atients who took placebo.
Based on these results, the researchers have decided that the results are /are not likely 
the result of chance .  Tofacitinib may be an option for treating patients with PsA who 
were not previously helped by csDMARDs.
This does not mean that everyone in this study had these results.  Other studies may 
produce different results , as well .  These are just some of the main findings of the 
study, and more information may be available at the websites listed at the end of this 
summary.  
WHAT MEDICAL PROBLEMS DID PATIENTS 
HAVE DURING THE STUDY ?
The researchers recorded any medical problems the participants had during the study.
Participants could have had medical problems for reasons not related to the study (for 
example, caused by an underlying disease or by chance). Or, medical problems could 
also have been caused by a study treatment or by another medicine the participant was 
taking. Sometimes the cause of a medical problem is unknown. By comparing 
medical problems across many treatment groups in many studies, doctors try to 
understand what the side effects of an experimental drug might be.
175 out of 422 patients (41%) in this study had at least 1 medical problem.  A total of 
17 patients (4%) left the study because of medical problems.  The most common 
medical problems are listed on the next page .

10WERE THERE ANY SERIOUS MEDICAL 
PROBLEMS ?
A medical problem is considered “serious” when it is life -threatening, needs hospital 
care, or causes lasting problems.  
28 patients (7%) had serious medical problems .  Eight (8)patients (7%) in the
tofacitinib 5 mg group, 4 patients (4%) in the tofacitinib 10mg group , 9patients (8%) 
in the adalimumab group, 3 patients (6%) in the placebo →tofacitinib 5 mg group, and 
4patients (8%) in the placebo →tofacitinib 10 mg group hadat least 1 serious medical 
problem. A total of 2 patients (less than 1%) had an injury to the joint, and the other 
serious medical problems happened in 1 patien t each.
One (1) patient (1%) in the tofacitinib 10 mg group and 2 patients (4%) in the 
placebo →tofacitinib 5 mg group had a serious medical problem that study doctors 
and the Sponsor determined was related to tofacitinib. One (1) patient (1%) in the 
tofac itinib 5 mg group had a serious medical problem that the study doctor said was 
related to tofacitinib, but the Sponsor said was unrelated. One (1) patient (2%) in the 
placebo →tofacitinib 5 mg group died during the study.  The study doctors and 
Sponsor det ermined that the death was not related to the study medicines.
