you for youror your child’s participation.
This summary will describe the study results. If you have any questions about the 
study or the results, please contact the doctor or staff at your or your child’s study 
site.Why was this study done?
What is alopecia areata ?
Alopecia areata is an autoimmune disorder, which may be chronic and reoccurring , 
where a patient experience snon-scarring hair loss .  It can affect adults and children 
across all ages, races, and sexes.   Alopecia areata can have a large impact on the
psychological health of both adult and pediatric patients, including damage to the
patient’s self-esteem, an increased occurrence of anxiety and depressi onand other 
psychological conditions, problems with social relationships , decreased health -related 
quality of life and a general decline in quality of life .
Patchy alopecia areata is the most common form of alopecia areata, which may 
develop into more widespread and often treatment -resistant forms of alopecia areata, 
especially when the disease starts a t an earlier age.  Alopecia areata involving 50% or 
greater scalp hair loss, including the loss of all the hair on the scalp ( alopecia totalis)
and the loss of all scalp, face and body hair (alopecia universalis) can be considered 
extensive form sof alopecia areata . 
What is Ritlecitinib ?
Ritlecitinib is a small molecule oral medication .  Small molecule s canmove easily 
through the cell membrane to interact with targeted molecules present inside a cell .
Ritlecitinib inhibits the enzymes (protein molecule in cells which speed up chemical 
reactions in the body) known as a Janus kinase 3 (JAK3) and tyrosine kinase 
expressed in hepatocellular carcinoma ( TEC )family . These enzymes are important 
regulators of inflammatory pathways in the cell and cause the production of molecules 
known as cytokines.  It is believed that these inflammatory pathways and cytokines are 
involved in dermatologic diseases such as vitiligo, atopic dermatitis ,as well as alopecia 
areata . What was the purpose of this study?
The purpose of this study was to compare ritlecitinib with a placebo to determine 
ritlecitinib ’s efficacy and safety in treating alopecia areata patients . Ritlecitinib is an 
investigational medication because it is not approved for use . The placebo looks like 
the study medication but does not contain any active ingredients. Researchers 
compare dthe results of taking the placebo to the results of taking ritlecitinib to see if 
there were any difference s.
Researchers wanted to know:
Did the participants taking ritlecitinib have a better response than 
theparticipants taking placebo atWeek 24 ?
What happened during the study?
How was the study done?
Researchers tested ritlecitinib on a group of study participants to find out if study 
participants taking ritlecitinib had a better response as measured by the Severity 
Alopecia Tool (SALT) in comparison to placebo at Week 24.  Following Week 24, 
participants taking placebo were switched to ritlecitinib during the extension period.  
The SALT score measures the severity of alopecia by capturing the percentage ofhair 
loss.  It was calculated by dividing the scalp into 4 quadrants with allocated percentage 
scalp surface area in each area.   The study was carried out as shown i n Figure 1 below .Figure 1: Overall study design
The study participants and researchers did not know who took ritlecitinib ,what 
dosage was received ,orwho took the placebo.   This is known as a “blinded” study.  
Study p articipants were assigned to each group by chance alone.
Where did this study take place?
The Sponsor ran this study at 118locations in Argentina, Australia, Canada, Chile, 
China, Colombia, Czech Republic, Germany, Hungary, Japan, Mexico, Poland, Russia, 
Spain, South Korea, Taiwan, United Kingdom ,and the U nited States.
When did this study take place?
It began 03 December 2018 and ended 24 June 2021 .
Who participated in this study?
The study included participants who :
Had a primary diagnosis of alopecia areata
Had at least 50% hair loss on their scalp
Were c urrently experiencing hair loss on their scalp
Were at least 12years old or older ,depending on the study location
A total of 1097 participants were screened, and 718 participants were randomized or 
assigned to a treatment group by chance .
A total of 272males participated .
A total of 446female sparticipated .
Six hundred and thirteen out of 718 (85%)of participants were at least 18 years 
old.Participants were to be treated until the planned end of treatment at 48 weeks . Of the 
718participants who started the study, 614participants completed the stu dy 
treatment .
Three participants were not treated, and 101 participants did not finish the study 
because :
the participant left by their own choice ,
the participant experienced a medical problem ,
the participant discovered they were pregnant,
a doctor decided it was best for a participant to stop being in the study ,
the participant could not be contacted ,
the treatment did not work for them ,
a protocol deviation occurred (an unplanned change from the study design ),
the participant was n on-complian twhile taking the study medication , 
orfor other reasons.
How long did the study last?
Study participants were in the study for approximately 57weeks .  The entire study 
took approximately 2½years to complete.
When the last participant ’slast visit occurred in June 2021 , the Sponsor began 
reviewing the information collected.  The Sponsor then created a report of the results.  
This is a summary of that report.What were the results of the study?
Did the participants taking ritlecitinib have a better response than 
the participants taking placebo at Week 24?
The responses of the participants to treatment with ritlecitinib or placebo was 
measured using the SALT score . A response was defined as those participants whose 
SALT score improved to less than or equal to 20% at Week 24. In Figure 2 below, 
the response based on absolute SALT ≤20 at Week 24 is shown for the different 
treatment groups.
Figure 2: Response of participants to treatment with ritlecitinib or placebo at 
Week 24
At Week 24, the participants in the 200/50 mg, 200/30 mg, 50 mg, and 30 mg 
groups treated with ritlecitinib were significantly different from placebo .  
A significant difference between 2 groups means that there is a measurable 
difference between the groups and that, statistically, the probability of 
obtaining that difference by chance is very small (less than 0.125%for this 
study ).
The percentage of responders ranged from 14% inthe group treated with 30 mg of 
ritlecitinib to 31% in the 200/50 mggroup . The group treated with r itlecitinib at
10mg (2%) was not that different when compared to placebo ( 2%).
Based on these results, the researchers have decided that the results are not likely 
the result of chance.  Ritlecitinib may help in the treatment of alopecia areata .  
This does not mean that everyone in this study had these results.  This is a summary 
ofthe main result of this study.  
What medical problems did participants have during 
the study?
The researchers recorded any medical problems the participants had during the study.  
Participants could have had medical problems for reasons not related to the study (for 
example, caused by an underlying disease or by chance). Or, medical problems could
also have been caused by a study treatment or by another medicine the participant was 
taking. Sometimes the cause of a medical problem is unknown. By comparing 
medical problems across many treatment groups in many studies, doctors try to 
understand what effects a study medication might have on a participant.
Five hundred and eighty -seven out of 71 5participants (82%) that received study 
treatment in this study had at least 1 medical problem up to Week 48.  A total of 
22participants left the study because of medical problems.  The most common medical problems –those reported byat least 5% of participants –are described 
below.
Below are instructions on how to read Table 1. 
Instructions for Understanding Table 1. 
The 1stcolumn of Table 1lists medical problems that were commonly 
reported during the study.  All medical problems reported by at least
5% of participants are listed.
The 2ndto 6thcolumn stells how many of the 584participants who 
tookdifferent doses of ritlecitinib for 48 weeks reported each medical 
problem.  Next to this number (the number in parenthesis ) is the 
percentage of the participants who took each dose ofritlecitinib who 
reported the medical problem. 
The 7thand 8thcolumn stellhow many of the 131participants who 
took placebo during the first 24 weeks followed by treatment with 
ritlecitinib (either 200/50 mg [65 participants ] or 50 mg 
[66participants]) from Weeks 25 to 48 reported each medical problem.  
Next to this number (the number in parenthesis ) is the percentage of 
the participants who took placebo during the first 24 weeks followed 
by either treatment with ritlecitinib (200/50 mg [65 participants] or 
50mg [66 participants]) from Weeks 25 to 48 who reported the 
medica l problem.
Using these instructions, you can see that 6out of the 131(5%)
participants who took ritlecitinib in the 200/ 50mggroup during the 
first 24 weeks reported acne.  A total of 5out of the 
65(8%)participants who took placebo during the first 24weeks 
followed by treatment with ritlecitinib (200/50 mg [65 participants]) 
from Weeks 25 to 48 reported acne.Table 1. Commonly reported medical problems by study participants uptoWeek 48

Did study participants have any serious medical 
problems?
A medical problem is considered “serious” when it is life -threatening, needs hospital 
care, is considered to be an important medical event, or causes lasting problems.
Fourteen participants ( 2%) had serious medical problems up to Week 48.  
Eleven participants in the group sthat received ritlecitinib for 48 weeks
experienced a serious medical problem.  
oIn the 200/50 mggroup (4 participants )experienced a serious medical 
problem including : 
inflammation of the appendix (appendicitis)infection of the lung tissue ( empyema )and overactive and toxic 
response to an infection ( sepsis )
a type of breast cancer that begins in the milk -producing glands of 
the breast called invasive lobular breast carcinoma
miscarriage
oIn the 200/30 mg group (2 participants) experienced :
inflammation of the appendix (appen dicitis) 
chemical poisoning & suicidal behavior
oIn the 50 mg group (2 participants) experienced :
breast cancer
blockage in an artery in the lungs (pulmonary embolism)
oIn the 30 mg group (1 parti cipant) experienced infection or 
inflammation of pouches that formed in the intestines ( diverticulitis ).
oIn the 10 mg group (2 participants) experienced : 
suicidal behavior
inflammatory condition of the skin ( eczema )
Three participants in the groups that received placebo for the first 24 weeks 
followed by treatment with ritlecitinib from weeks25to 48 experienced a 
serious medical problem.  These medical problems were all reported during the 
first 24 weeks when the participants were taking placebo.
oIn the placebo to 200/50 mg group no serious medical problems were 
exper ienced by participants
oIn the placebo to 50 mg group (3 participants) experienced :
miscarriageA mental condition in which a person experiences blindness, 
paralysis ,or other nervous system (neurologic) symptoms that 
cannot be explained by illness or injury ( conversion disorder )
heavy period
No participants died during the study. Where can I learn more about this study?
