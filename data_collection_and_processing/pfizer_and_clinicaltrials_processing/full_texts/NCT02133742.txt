Clinical Study Results
This summary reports the results of only one study. Researchers must look at the 
results of many types of studies to understand if a study medication works, how it 
works, and if it is safe to prescribe to study participants. The results of this study 
might be different than the results of other studies that the researchers review.

Why was this study done?
What is Advanced Renal Cell Cancer?
Cancer occurs when cells in the body divide without control and can spread to other 
parts of the body.  Renal cell cancer is the most common form of kidney cancer.  It 
starts in the lining of the small tubes inside the kidney that help clean and filter blood.  
Advanced renal cell cancer is when the disease has progressed to Stage IV and has 
spread to other parts of the body.
What are Axitinib and MK -3475?
Axitinib , pronounced AK-sih-TIH-nib, also called Inlyta®, is a tablet, taken by mouth 
twice a day.  Researchers think Axitinib may help patients with advanced renal cell 
cancer by stopping the body from making a protein called “vascular endothelial 
growth factor”, or VEGF.  Cancer cells make extra amounts of some proteins 
including VEGF when growing.  The extra VEGF tells the surrounding cells to make 
new blood vessels that tumors need to grow.  Blood vessels are tiny tubes that allow 
blood to move around and provi de nutrients and oxygen to all the parts of the body.  
MK-3475, also called Pembrolizumab or Keytruda®, is an intravenous (IV) treatment 
that researchers believe may help patients with cancer.  MK -3475 works by sticking to 
a protein called “anti -programme d cell death protein”, which prevents it from 
protecting cancer cells from the body’s immune system. 
Researchers think taking both Axitinib and MK -3475 may help patients with 
advanced renal cell cancer, as they work in different ways.  However, first they needed 
to know more about the safety of taking both these treatments at the same time.  
What was the purpose of this study?
The purpose of this study was to and learn how safe the combination of Axitinib 
MK-3475 were for patients with advanced renal cell cancer and figure out the best 
dose to use in future studies.

What happened during the study? 
How was the study done?
This study had two parts: the dose finding part and the dose expansion part.
Researchers wanted to know:
How safe was the combination of Axitinib and MK -3475 for 
participants with advanced renal cell cancer?
What medical problems did participants have during the study?

Researchers tested 2 different doses of Axitinib in combination with 2 milligrams per 
kilogram each participant weighed (also called “mg/kg”) of MK -3475 on a group of 
participants with advanced renal cell cancer to learn how safe the combination of 
Axitinib and MK -3475.
In the dose finding part of the s tudy, participants were to take Axitinib at a dose of 
5mg by mouth, twice a day.  Participants were also to take 2 mg/kg MK -3475 inside 
the vein (IV).  After 3 weeks, the participants either continued taking the 5 mg dose of 
Axitinib or were switched to t he 3 mg dose of Axitinib. 
The participants and researchers knew who took the 5 mg dose of Axitinib and who 
took 3 mgdose of Axitinib.  All participants knew they were taking MK -3475. This is 
known as an “open -label” study.  Participants were assigned to each group by their 
doctor based on each participant’s condition.
During the dose expansion part of the study, the participants from the dose finding 
part of the study continued to take these medications at the dose chosen by their 
doctors.  New patients also joined the study and were given 1 of the 2 doses of 
Axitinib as chosen by their doctors. 
Researchers took samples of blood and urine from participants once every 3 weeks 
during both the dose finding and dose expansion parts of the study and measured the 
amounts of Axitinib and MK -3475.  Researchers also checked the participants’ health 
during the study and asked them how they were feeling. 
Researchers then compared the number of participants that had certain medical 
problems in the Axitinib 5 mg to t he participants taking Axitinib 3 mg.  
Where did this study take place? 
The Sponsor ran this study at 10 locations in 1 country in North America.
When did this study take place?
It began 16 September 2014 and ended 03 July 2019.

Who participated in this study?
The study included participants who were at least 18 years old, had advanced renal cell 
cancer, and at least 1 tumour their doctor could measure. 
A total of 41 men participated
A total of 11 women participated
All participants were between the ages of 28 and 75 years
Participants were to be treated until their cancer got worse, they chose to leave the 
study, or a doctor decided it was best for them to stop being in the study.  Of the 
52participants who started the study, no patients were still cont inuing in the study at 
the time of this report. 
How long did the study last?
The amount of time that study participants were in the study varied depending on 
their response to the study treatment, but the entire study took 58 months to 
complete.
When the study ended in July 2019, the Sponsor began reviewing the information 
collected.  The Sponsor then created a report of the results.  This is a summary of that 
report.
What were the results of the study?
Were there any safety concerns for participants taking Axitinib in 
combination with MK -3475?
To learn more about safety, the study doctors did a number of tests and exams, 
including lab tests, heart tracings, physical exams, and vital signs (blood pressure , 
weight, and heart rate).  There were no meaningful changes found on these tests.
The researchers also examined what medical problems the patients experienced 
during the study.  This information is provided in the next section.

This does not mean that eve ryone in this study had these results.  Other studies may 
produce different results, as well.  These are just some of the main findings of the 
study, and more information may be available at the websites listed at the end of this 
summary.  
What medical pr oblems did participants have during 
the study?
The researchers recorded any medical problems the participants had during the study.  
Participants could have had medical problems for reasons not related to the study (for 
example, caused by an underlying disease or by chance).  Or, medical problems could 
also have been caused by a study treatment or by another medicine the participant was 
taking.  Sometimes the cause of a medical problem is unknown.  By comparing 
medical problems across many treatment grou ps in many studies, doctors try to 
understand what effects a study medication might have on a participant.
All 52 (100%) participants in this study had at least 1 medical problem.  A total of 
20(20% or 1 out of 5) participants left the study because of me dical problems.  The 
most common medical problems –those reported by at least 20% of participants –
are described below.

Below are instructions on how to read Table 1. 
Instructions for Understanding Table 1. 
The 1stcolumn of Table 1 lists medical problems that were commonly 
reported during the study.  All medical problems reported by at least 
20% of participants are listed.
The 2ndcolumn tells how many of the 52participants reported each 
medical problem that the r esearchers felt were due to either of the 
study medications.  Next to this number is the percentage of the 
52participants who reported the medical problem. 
Using these instructions, you can see that 39 out of the 52 participants 
taking the study medicati ons reported feeling tired.

Did study participants have any serious medical 
problems?
A medical problem is considered “serious” when it is life-threatening, needs hospital 
care, or causes lasting problems.
Twenty -nine (29)participants (56%, or 14 out of 25 participants) had serious medical 
problems while taking Axitinib and MK-3475.  Serious medical problems reported by 
at least 2% of study participants can be found in Table 2, below.  
Fourteen (14) patients died during the study, 11 were due to their cancer getting worse, 
2 were due to unknown causes, and 1 death happened from a medical procedure .  Only 
1 death occurred while the participant was taking the study medications, the other 
13deaths were more than 90 days after the participants had received their last dose.  
The researchers d id not consider these deaths to be related to the study medicines.
