Why was this study done?
What is meningococcal disease?
Invasive meningococcal disease is an illness which may cause a serious infection in the
blood, as well as swelling around the brain and spinal cord. Meningococcal disease is
more common in young children than adults. Children who get this illness are at risk 
forhearing loss and other disabilities. However, invasive meningococcal disease may 
be prevented with a vaccine. A vaccine is a type of medicine that helps peo ple fight 
off germs.
Meningococcal disease is caused by the meningococcus germ. There are different
types of this germ. For example, meningococcal type A disease is caused by the
meningococcus A germ. 
What are MenACWY -TT and 13 -Valent Pneumococcal Conju gate 
Vaccine?
MenACWY -TT (Nimenrix®) is a vaccine approved for the prevention of 
meningococcal disease. This vaccine targets 4 common types of meningococcus germ: 
A, C, Y, and W. It is given by injection into the muscle.
Some children in this study also received another vaccine, called 13 Valent 
Pneumococcal Conjugate Vaccine (Prev enar13®). Prev enar13 is often given at the 
same time as MenACWY -TT. Prevenar 13 targets 13 common types of the 
pneumococcus germ, which can cause ear infections or other serio us infections. It is 
given by injection into the muscle. 
For this study, MenACWY -TT was considered an investigational vaccine, which 
means that it’s still being studied.

What was the purpose of this study?
The main purpose of this study was to learn about the safety and effects of 
MenACWY -TTin toddler -aged children, when given alone or together with 13-Valent 
Pneumococcal Conjugate Vaccine . 
Researchers wanted to know:
Would children have an immune response against meningococcus 
germs 1 month after receiving their last dose of MenACWY -TT?
Would children still have an immune response against 
meningococcus germs 1 year, 3 years, and 5 years after receiving 
their last dose of MenACWY -TT?
To answer these questions, researchers collected blood samples from the children. 
The researchers looked for antibodies in the blood against the 4 different types of
meningococcus germ. Antibodies are special proteins made by the body that can 
recognize and help kill germs. This is known as an “immune response”.  Antibodies 
may protect children from getting sick when they come into contact with 
meningococcus germs. 
What happened during the study?
How was the study done?
This study compared 4 groups of children to learn more about the effects
of MenACWY -TT when given alone or together with 13 -Valent Pneumococcal 
Conjugate Vaccine. Children were assigned to 1 of 4 groups by chance alone .
Group 1: Children received 1 dose of MenACWY -TT(203 participants)
Group 2: Children received 2 doses of MenACWY -TT, given 2 months apart
(197 participants)
090177e19836da19\Approved\Approved On: 04-Oct-2021 01:59 (GMT)
Group 3: Children received 1 dose of MenACWY -TTtogether with 1 dose of 
13-Valent Pneumococcal Conjugate Vaccine (201 participants)
Group 4: Children received 1 dose of 13-Valent Pneumococcal Conjugate 
Vaccine, followed by 1 dose of MenACWY -TTgiven 2 months later
(201 participants)
All children were between 12 and 14 months of age when they received their first 
dose of study vaccine. Children and their parents/guardians were expected to attend 7 
in-person study visits and 1 phone visit. The researchers collected blood samples from 
the children throughout the study. They looked for antibodies in the blood against the 
4different types of meningo coccus germ.
This was an “open label” study, which means that the children, their
parents/guardians, and the researchers knew which vaccines the children received .
The figure below shows what happened during the study.

Where did this study take place?
The study took place at54 locations in 6countries .
When did this study take place?
It began 02 October 2013 and ended 05 December 2019.
Who participated in this study?
Children were checked (screened) by the study doctors to make sure they were a good 
fit for the study. 
This study included children who:
Were between 12 and 14 months of age when they received their first study 
vaccine
Were considered to be healthy or with stable chronic disease by the study 
doctors
Did not have a disease or take medicine that would be associated with a 
weakened immune system
Had never had meningococcal disease 
Had been vaccinated with 13 -Valent Pneumococcal Conjugate Vacci ne and 
Diphtheria, Tetanus, and Pertussis containing -vaccine (DTP) at least 5 months 
before joining the study
Had not received certain other vaccines
Had never had a severe medical problem or allergic reaction to any of the study 
vaccine ingredients
Parent s/guardians were informed of the risks and benefits of this study and 
agreed to participate
Of the 802 children who completed vaccination, 619 (77%) returned for their 5 -year 
follow -up visit. 184 children (23%) left the study early by their parent/guardian ’s 
choice or because they passed away for a reason that was not related to study 
vaccination (2 participants). 
A total of 375 girls (47%) were vaccinated

A total of 427 boys (5 3%) were vaccinated
All children were between the ages of 12 and 14 months when they received 
their first study vaccin e
How long did the study last?
Children were in the study for about 62 months. The entire study took more than 
6years to complete.
This study was completed as planned. When the study ended in December 20 19, the 
Sponsor began reviewing the information collected. The Sponsor then created a report 
of the results. This is a summary of that report.
What were the results of the study?
Did children have an immune response against meningococcus 
germs 1 month after receiving their last dose of MenACWY -TT?
One month after their last dose of MenACWY -TT, most children (at least 93%) in all 
4vaccine groups produced strong immune responses aga inst mening ococcus germs.    
Did children still have an immune response against meningococcus 
germs 1 year, 3 years, and 5 years after receiving their last dose of 
MenACWY -TT?
In general, children still had immune responses against meningococcus germs 1 year, 
3years, and 5 years after receiving their last dose of MenACWY -TT. The number of 
children who still had immune responses against meningococcus germs 1 year, 3 years, 
and 5 years after receiving their last dose of MenACWY -TT was similar in all 4 vacci ne 
groups.  
This does not mean that everyone in this study had these results. These are just some 
of the main findings of this study. Other studies may have different results.

What medical problems did participants have during 
the study?
The researchers recorded medical problems the participants had during the study. 
Participants could have had medical problems for reasons not related to the study (for 
example, caused by an underlying disease or by chance). Or, medical problems could 
also have been caused by a study vaccine or by another medicine the participant was 
taking. Sometimes the cause of a medical problem is unknown. By comparing medical 
problems across vaccine groups in many studies, doctors try to understand what 
effects a study vaccine might have on a participant.
How many participants had medical problems within 30 days of 
receiving study vaccine?
The following percentage of participants had medical problems within 30 days of 
receiving the first dose of study vaccine:
Group 1 (1 dose of MenACWY -TT): 4 2% (86 out of 203 participants)
Group 2 (2 doses of MenACWY -TT, given 2 months apart): 46% (91 out of 
197participants)
Group 3: (1 dose of MenACWY -TTtogether with 1 dose of 13-Valent 
Pneumococcal Conjugate Vaccine): 43% (86 out of 201 participants)
Group 4 (1 dose of 13-Valent Pneumococcal Conjugate Vaccine, followed by 
1dose of MenACWY -TTgiven 2 months later): 42% (85 out of 
201participants)
One participant left the study because of a medical problem that was not 
considered to be related to the study vaccines.
