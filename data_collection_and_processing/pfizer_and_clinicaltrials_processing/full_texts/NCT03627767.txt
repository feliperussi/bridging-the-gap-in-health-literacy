1CLINICAL TRIAL RESULTS
This summary reports the results of only one study.  Researchers must look at the 
results of many types of studies to understand if a study medicine works, how it 
works, and if it is safe to prescribe to patients.  The results of this study might be 
different than the results of other studies that the researchers review.

2WHY WAS THIS STUDY DONE?
Atopic dermatitis (or “AD”), which is also sometimes called atopic eczema, is a
common skin disorder that causes patches of flaky, red, and very itchy skin. Some of 
the current medicines available for AD can only be used for short time periods, or can 
cause other health problems. Researchers are looking for new treatments for AD that 
can be taken for long periods of time.
While researchers think that many th ings cause AD, it is made worse by the body’s
immune system (the body’s defense against infection) causing redness and swelling
(inflammation). Cells in the immune system trigger inflammation by making special
proteins called “cytokines”. Researchers thi nk that medicines that modify the way 
these cytokines work could help treat patients with AD .  
The drug tested in this study was PF -04965842, which now has the generic name
abrocitinib. PF-04965842 is an experimental drug that has not been approved for 
sale. PF-04965842 blocks the activity of a protein called “Janus kinase 1”, which acts 
like an on/off switch for the cells of the immune system. By blocking Janus kinase 1 
activity , the signal to the cells that triggers inflammation is modified.
Patien ts with AD can have “flare -ups”, which are times when AD symptoms are 
worse.  The researchers in this study wanted to learn if patients who saw 
improvement in AD after beginning PF -04965842 would be able to maintain this 
improvement and have fewer flare -ups.  The researchers asked this question: 
How many patients who took PF-04965842 had a flare -up, compared to 
patients who took placebo?
WHAT HAPPENED DURING THE STUDY?
This study compared 3 groups of patients who saw improvement in AD after first 
taking PF-04965842 200 mg fo r12 weeks, to find out if patients who then took 
PF-04965842 for 40 weeks would havefewer flare -ups, compared to patients who 
then took placebo for 40 weeks .A placebo does not have any medicine in it, but

3looks just like the medici ne being tested.  Using a placebo helps researchers learn if 
the study drug works better than no treatment at all.  
The study included adult men and women, and boys and girls who were aged 12 years
and older, and who weighed at least 40 kilograms (about 88 pounds). Patients 
included in the study :
Had chronic (long -term) AD for at least 1 year, and had moderate to severe 
AD when they entered the study.
Also had one of the following:
oHad been treated up to 6 months earlier for AD with medicines applied 
to the skin, and their AD did not get better .
oNeeded to use medicines that reach all parts of the body to control their 
AD (for example, taking medicines by mouth) .
The first part of the study was “open -label”, which means that the patients and 
doctors knew what treatment was being given.  During this open -label period, all 
patients received PF-04965842 at a dose of 200 mg every day for 12 weeks.  
Next, those patients who saw improvement during the open -label period were 
assigned to 1 of 3 treatment groups by chance (like the flip of a coin or drawing 
straws) to receive either PF -04965842 at a dose of 100 mg, PF -04965842 at a dose of 
200 mg, or placebo for 40 weeks.  This is known as a “randomized” study. This is 
done so that every patient has an equal chance of getting 1of the 3 treatments ,and 
there is no bias or selection involved in a ssigning the treatment s.
During this part of the study, the patients ,doctors ,and researchers did not know who 
took PF-04965842 and who took the placebo.  This is known as a “double -blinded” 
period.  This is done to make sure the results of the research study cannot be unfairly 
influenced by anyone.  
Patients who had a flare -up during the double -blind p eriod could sta rt “rescue 
treatment” with PF -04965842 at a dose of 200 mg every day plus medicine applied to 
the skin for 12 weeks.
The figure below shows what happened during the study.

4Patients were expected to be in the study for about 5 6weeks total (treatment plus 
follow -up), but the entire study took more than 2 years to complete.  The Sponsor ran 
this study at 236 locations in Asia, Europe, North America, and South America.  It 
began on 11 June 2018 and ended on 7 October 2020.  A total of 684boys/men 
(55%) and 549girls/women (4 5%) participated.  All patients were between the ages of 
12 and 82 years. 
Of the 1233 patients who started the 12-week open -label p eriod and received 
treatment, 798 (65%) saw improvement and were therefore eligible to enter the 
double -blind p eriod .  During the 12-week open -label p eriod , a total of 120 patients 
(10%) stopped taking study treatment or left the study early by their choice or because 
a doctor decided it was best for them to stop the study.   A total of 315 pati ents (26%) 
completed the 12 -week open -label period, but their response was not good enough to 
enter the double -blind period.
Of the 798 patients who entered the 40-week double -blind p eriod , 705 patients (88%) 
completed it.  A total of 93 patients (12%) sto pped taking study treatment or left the

the study.
When the study ended in October 2020, the Sponsor began reviewing the information 
collected.  The Sponsor then created a report of the results.  This is a summary of that 
report.
WHAT WERE THE RESULTS OF THE STUDY?
How  many patients who took PF -04965 842had a flare -up, 
compared to patients who took placebo?
In this study, patients who took PF-04965842 during the double -blind p eriod were 
less likely to have a flare -up than patients who took placebo during the double -blind 
period .  At Week 52 of the study, 129 out of 2 23patients (58%) in the PF -04965842 
100 mg group had not had a flare -up.  166 out of 2 06 patients (81%) in the 
PF-04965842 200 mg group had not had a flare -up.  42 out of 2 30patients (18%) in 
the placebo group had not had a flare -up. The figure below shows these results.

6Based on these results, the researchers have decided that the results are not likely the 
result of chance.  PF-04965842 may be an option for treating AD in adults and 
children 12 years and older .
This does not mean that everyone in this study had these res ults.  Other studies may 
produce different results, as well.  These are just some of the main findings of the 
study, and more information may be available at the websites listed at the end of this 
summary.  
WHAT MEDICAL PROBLEMS DID PATIENTS 
HAVE DURING T HE STUDY?
The researchers recorded any medical problems the participants had during the study.  
Participants could have had medical problems for reasons not related to the study (for 
example, caused by an underlying disease or by chance).  Or, medical prob lems could 
also have been caused by a study treatment or by another medicine the participant was 
taking.  Sometimes the cause of a medical problem is unknown.  By comparing 
medical problems across many treatment groups in many studies, doctors try to 
under stand what the side effects of an experimental drug might be.
555 out of 1233 patients (45%) in this study had at least 1 medical problem. Of the 
patients who were randomized to the double -blind period , 89 out of 265 patients 
(34%) in the PF-04965842 100 mg group, 101 out of 2 66 patients (38%) in the 
PF-04965842 200 mg group, and 94 out of 267 patients (35%) in the placebo group 
had at least 1 medical problem.  
43 out of 1233 patients (3%) left the study because of a medical problem. Of the 
patients who were randomized to the double -blind p eriod , 5 out of 265 patients (2%) 
in the PF-04965842 100 mg group, 16 out of 2 66 patients (6%) in the PF -04965842 
200 mg group, and 4 out of 267 patients (1%) in the placebo group left the study 
because of a medical problem.  
The most common medical problems are listed below.

8WERE THERE ANY SERIOUS MEDICAL 
PROBLEMS?
A medical problem is considered “serious” when it is life -threatening, needs hospital 
care, or causes lasting problems.  
43 out of 1233 patients (3%) had serious medical problems.  One patient (less than 
1%) died during the open -label p eriod , and the death was not considered to be related 
to study treatment.  The serious medical problems that happened in more than 
1patient are listed below.
