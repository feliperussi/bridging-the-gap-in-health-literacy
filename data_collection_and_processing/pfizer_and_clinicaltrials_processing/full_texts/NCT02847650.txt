1CLINICAL TRIAL RESULTS
This summary reports the results of only one study.  Researchers must look at the 
results of many types of studies to understand if a study medicine works, how it 
works, and if it is safe to prescribe to patients.  The results of this study might be 
different than the results of other studies that the researchers review.

2WHY WAS THIS STUDY DONE?
Parkinson’s disease i s a disease of the nervous system that affects movement.  Patients 
with Parkinson’s disease can have many symptoms, such as weakness, tremor, stiff 
muscles, and slowed movements.  These are known as “motor symptoms.”  The 
symptoms of Parkinson’s disease us ually develop slowly over several years. 
Doctors aren’t sure exactly what causes Parkinson’s disease, but it occurs when certain 
nerve cells in the brain die.  These nerve cells are found in the part of the brain that 
controls movement, and they make a ch emical called “dopamine.”  Many medicines 
used to treat Parkinson’s disease work by increasing the amount of dopamine in the 
brain, which could help decrease Parkinson’s symptoms.
PF-06649751 was studied as a possible treatment for Parkinson’s disease.  Th e main 
goal of this study was to learn more about the use of PF-06649751 in patients with 
Parkinson’s disease who were at an early stage of the disease.  Researchers wanted to 
answer this question:
Did motor symptoms decrease in patients who received PF-06649751 , 
compared to patients who received placebo?
A placebo does not have any medicine in it, but looks just like the medicine.
WHAT HAPPENED DURING THE STUDY?
This study compared 2 groups of patients to find out if motor symptoms would 
decrease in patients taking PF-06649751 , compared to patients taking placebo. The 
study included patients with early stage Parkinson’s disease who had motor 
symptoms.  To be elig ible to join the study, patients must not have used a dopamine 
medicine for longer than 28 days, or within 7 days of beginning the study.
Patients in this study were assigned to receive either PF-06649751 or placebo.  The 
patients and researchers did not k now who took PF-06649751 and who took the 
placebo.  This is known as a “blinded” study.  Patients were assigned to each 
treatment group by chance alone.  This is known as a “randomized” study.  Putting 
people into groups by chance helps make the groups more similar so they can be 
compared.

3First, patients were checked by a study doctor to mak e sure they met the requirements 
to join the study.  This was called the screening period, which lasted 30 days.
During the treatment period, which lasted 15 weeks, patients received either 
PF-06649751 or placebo.  The treatment period included 2 parts:
9-week “dose optimization period”.  During this part of the study, the dose was 
gradually increased each week, as tolerated by the patient.  The target dose was 
3 to 15 milligrams of PF-06649751 or matching placebo, taken each day. 
6-week “maintenance perio d”.  During this part of the study, patients were to 
receive the target dose of PF-06649751 or matching placebo each day.
During the treatment period, patients hadstudy appointment visits to be checked by 
study doctors to determine if motor symptoms were improving.  Patients were also 
asked about any medical problems they were having.
Finally, patients came to 2 follow -up visits after their last dose of PF-06649751 or 
placebo, at week 17 and week 19.
This study ended early in January 2018, because another study that was being done 
with PF-06649751 did not show benefit for patients with Parkinson’s disease.  So, the 
sponsor decided to stop this study, as well.  However, patients who were already 
enrolled in the study were allowed to complete it.
The figure o n the following page shows what happened during this study.

4Patients were in this study for up to 23 weeks, but the entire study took more than 
15months to complete.  The sponsor ran this study at 23 locations in Germany, 
France, Israel, and the United States.  It began 17 October 2016 and ended 29 January 
2018.  34 men (60%) and 23 women (40%) joined the study and received study 
treatment.  All patients were between the ages of 45 and 79 years.
Patients were to complete the 15 -week treatment period andthen enter a 28 -day 
follow -up period.  Of the 57 patients who started the study and received study 
treatment, 54 patients (95%) completed the follow -up period.  However, a total of 
10out of 57 patients (18%) stopped taking study treatment early by their choice or 
because they had a medical problem.

5When the study ended early in January 2018, the Sponsor began reviewing the 
information collected.  The Sponsor then created a report of the results.  This is a 
summary of that report. 
WHAT WERE THE RESULTS OF THE STUDY?
Did motor symptoms decrease in patients who received 
PF-06649751, compared to patients who received placebo?
To answer this question, the researchers used a rating scale designed to measure 
Parkinson’s disease symptoms.  The researchers looked to see if patients would have a 
change in their rating scale score from before they started study treatment (baseline) 
to after they finished study treatment (week 15).  
On average, patients who received PF -06649751 had a rating scale score change 
of-9units, while patients who received placebo had a rating scale score change of -4.3 
units.  So, on average, symptoms decreased more in patients who received 
PF-06649751 compared to patients who received placebo. The researchers have 
determined that these r esults are not likely based on chance.  The figure below shows 
these study results.

6This does not mean that everyone in this study had these results.  Other studies may 
produce different results, as well.  These are just some of the main findings of the 
study .More information may be available at the websites listed at the end of this 
summary.  
WHAT MEDICAL PROBLEMS DID PATIENTS 
HAVE DURING THE STUDY?   
The researchers recorded any medical problems the participants had during the study. 
Participants coul d have had medical problems for reasons not related to the study (for 
example, caused by an underlying disease or by chance).  Or, medical problems could 
also have been caused by a study treatment, or by another medicine the participant 
was taking.  Someti mes the cause of a medical problem is unknown.  By comparing 
medical problems across many treatment groups in many studies, doctors try to 
understand what the side effects of an experimental drug might be.
43out of 57 patients ( 75%) had at least 1 medical problem, including 2 5out of 
29patients ( 86%) who received PF-06649751 and 1 8out of 28 patients ( 64%) who 
received placebo .  A total of 6 patients (11%) stopped taking study treatment because 
of medical problems ,including 2 patients who received PF -06649751 and 4 patients 
who received placebo .  The most common medical problems are listed below .

WERE THERE ANY SERIOUS MEDICAL 
PROBLEMS?
A medical problem is considered “serious” when it is life -threatening, needs hospital 
care, or causes lasting problems.  
1 patient (2%) had a serious medical problem (thoughts of suicide), which the study 
doctor determined was related to study treatment.  This patient was in the 
PF-06649751 group. No patients died during the study.
