2WHY WAS THIS STUDY DONE?
Lung cancer is the name for cancer that starts in the lungs.  Non-small cell lung 
cancer (NSCLC) is the most common type of lung cancer .  Some patients have 
NSCLC that is referred to as “ ALK -positive” or “ ROS1 -positive” .  These patients 
have changes in their genes that can cause cancer cells to grow .
The Sponsor is developing a n investigational medicine called lorlatinib to treat 
ALK -positive and ROS1 -positive lung cancers.  There are certain p roteins called 
“kinases” that help cancer cells to grow .As they grow, the cancer cells can form into 
a tumor and spread to other parts of the body , such as the br ain.  Lorlatinib may be 
able to block kinases , potentially reducing tumor size and stopping ALK -positive and 
ROS1 -positive lung cancers from being able to grow and spread . Lorlatinib is known 
as an “ ALK -inhibitor” medication.
This was the first study to test lorlatinib in humans .  At the time this study began, 
lorlatinib was not approved for use outside of research studies.  Since that time, 
lorlatinib has been approved in the United States for certain patients.   
The researche rs wanted to learn more about the effects of lorlatinib, and to find the 
correct dose for treati ng ALK -positive and ROS1 -positive lung cancer patients .  This 
study was divided into 2 parts: phase 1 and phase 2.   
The purpose of the study was to answer the following questions :
For phase 1, what “dose -limiting toxicities” did patients have at each 
dose during th eir first treatment cycle ?
“Dose -limiting toxicities ”(DLTs )are certain medical problems caused by 
taking lorlatinib which require the patient to lower the dose or stop taking the 
medic ine(permanently or temporarily). DLTs can be many things, and may 
include, for example, fever with a low count of white blood cells orswelling in 
the pancreas . 
For phase 2, how many patients would have a reduction in tumor size 
after taking lorlatinib?

3WHAT HAPPENED DURING THE STUDY?
A total of 54 patients with ALK -positive or ROS1 -positive NSCLC joined phase 1 of 
the study.  32 patients (59%) were women and 22 patients (41%) were men .  
For phase 1, researchers wanted to find the right dose for treating NSCLC.  Patients 
entered the study in small groups of 3 to 17 patients .  Each group was given a 
different dose of lorlatinib, and the patients were watched closely for any medical 
problems .  The doses for each group ranged from 10 mg to 200 mg lorlatinib given 
either once a day or twice a day .  Patients took lorlatinib in “cycles” that lasted 
21days.
There was no specific amount of time that patients were required to stay in phase 1 of 
thestudy.  Of the 54 patients who started the study, 19 patients were still in the study
as of March 2017 .  35 patients left the study by their own choice , because of a medical 
problem, or because a doctor decided it was best for a patient to stop the study .
After researchers decided on the correct dose of lorlatinib (100 mg once a day ), they 
startedphase 2 of the study.  A total of 275 patients joined phase 2.  157 patients 
(57%) were women and 118 patients (43%) were men .  All patients were between the 
ages of 19and 85years old.
For phase 2, patients were placed in groups based on what type of NSCLC they had 
and what treatments they’d already tried.  Some of the patients in this study had 
already taken chemotherapy, an ALK -inhibitor medicine called crizot inib, or other 
ALK -inhibitor medicines.  Patients were assigned to the following treatment groups:
Group 1: Patients with ALK -positive cancer and no previous treatments .
Group 2: Patients with ALK -positive cancer who got worse despite taki ng 
crizotinib .
Group 3: Patients with ALK -positive cancer who got worse despite taking 
crizotinib and chemotherapy .
Group 4: Patients with ALK -positive cancer who got worse despite taking 
1prior ALK -inhibit or medication different from crizotinib .  These patients 
may also have had chemotherapy .

4Group 5: Patients with ALK -positive cancer who got w orse despite taking 
2prior ALK -inhibitor medications .  These patients may also have had 
chemotherapy .
Group 6: Patients with ALK -positive cancer who got w orse despite taking 
3prior ALK -inhibitor medications .  These patients may also have had 
chemotherapy .
Group 7: Patients with ROS1 -positive c ancer.  The sepatients may or may not 
have had previous treatments.
During phase 2, all patients took 100 mg of lorlatinib once each day.  T hey took 
lorlatinib in treatment cycles of 21 days.  Patients were watched closely for any 
medical problems and to see how lorlatinib was working. 
There was no specific amount of time that patients were required to stay in phase 2 of 
the study.  Of the 275patients who started this phase of the study ,157 patients were
still in the study as of March 2017 .  118 patients left the study by their own choice , 
because of a medical problem, or because a doctor decided it was best for a patient to 
stop the study .

5Patients joined the study at 1 of 47 centers in Asia, Australia, Europe, and North 
America . The study began in January 2014, and wasstill ongoing as of 
November 2018.  This report is a summary of th e study results up to March 2017.
WHAT WERE THE RES ULTS OF THE STUDY?
For phase 1, what “dose -limiting toxicities” did patients have 
at each dose during their first treatment cycle ?
During phase 1, researchers wanted to find the correct dose of lorlatinib for treating 
patients with NSCLC.  To find the correct dose, t he researchers needed to know how 
many patients in each dose group had a DLT during their first 21-day treatment cycle , 
and what the DLTs were .
There was 1 patient who had a DLT .  This patient took 200 mg of lorlatinib once a 
day.  However, most of the patie nts who took either 150 mg or 200 mg of lorlatinib
once a day had other medical problems that caused them to temporarily stop or lower 
their dose of lorlatinib.   Using this information, the researchers decided that 100 mg 
once a day was th e correct lorlatinib dose for treating patients with NSCLC . 
For phase 2, how many patients had a reduction in tumor 
size after taking lorlatinib ?
For phase 2, there were patients in each treatment group who showed a reduction in 
tumor size after taking lorlatinib.  The average results were different for each 
treatment group, with 33% to 90% of patients in the treatment groups showing a 
reduction in tumor size.  The chart on the following page shows the results for each 
treatment group.

6The researchers also wanted to know if lorlatinib would help patients with NSCLC 
that had spread to the brain.  There were patients in each treatment group who 
showed a reduction in brain tumor size after taking lorlatinib.  The average results 
were different for each tre atment group, with 40% to 75% of patients in the treatment 
groups showing a reduction in brain tumor size.  The chart on the following page
shows the results for each treatment group.

7This does not mean that everyone in this study had these results.  Oth er studies may 
produce different results, as well.  These are just some of the main findings of the 
study, and more information may be available at the websites listed at the end of this 
summary.
WHAT MEDICAL PROBLEMS DID PATIENTS
HAVE DURING THE STUDY ?
The researchers recorded any medical problems the participants had during the study. 
Participants could have had medical problems for reasons not related to the study (for 
example, caused by an underlying disease or by chance).  Or, medical problems could 
have been caused by a study treatment, or by another medicine the participant was 
taking.  Sometimes the cause of a medical problem is unknown.  By comparing 
medical problems across many treatment groups in many studies, doctors try to 
understand what the side effects of an experimental drug might be .
During phase 1 of the study, all 54 patients (100%) had at least 1 non -serious medical 
problem (that means a medical problem that is not life -threatening, does not cause

1 left the study due to medical problems .  The most common non -serious medical 
problems reported during phase 1 are listed below.

WERE THERE ANY SERIOUS MEDICAL 
PROBLEMS ?
A medical problem is considered “serious” when it is life -threatening, causes lasting 
problems, or needs hospital care.  
During phase 1, 28 out of 54 patients (52%) had at least 1 serious medical problem .  
During phase 2, 89 out of 275 patients (32%) had at least 1 serious medical problem.   
As of March 2017 , for phase 1, a total of 27 out of 54 patients (50%) died during the 
study or the follow -up period.  For phase 2, a total of 64 out of 275 patients (23%) 
died during the study or the follow -up period.  The study d octors determined that 
none of these deaths (0%) were related to taking lorlatinib.
