1CLINICAL TRIAL RESULTS
This summary reports the results of only one study.  Researchers must look at the 
results of many types of studies to understand if a study medicine works, how it 
works, and if it is safe to prescribe to patients.  The results of this study might be 
different than the results of other studies that the researchers review.

WHY WAS THIS STUDY DONE?
Squamous cell carcinoma is a type of cancer that originates in the squamous cells, 
which are flat cells that line the outer layer of the skin and the mouth, nose, and 
throat.  Squamou s cell carcinoma is the most common type of cancer found in the 
head and neck.
Researchers are looking for treatments for squamous cell carcinoma of the head and 
neck.  Avelumab is a medicine that may work by targeting a protein called 
“Programmed Death -Ligand 1” (PD -L1) found on the cancer cell.  PD -L1 is involved 
in the body’s immune system response to cancer. 
When this study was started, avelumab was being tested for use in patients with locally 
advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck.  Lo cally advanced refers to 
cancer that has spread to nearby body tissues.  Although avelumab is approved in 
other types of cancer, it is not approved for use in head and neck cancer. 
The standard treatment for squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck in cludes a 
combination of radiation therapy and a chemotherapy medicine called cisplatin.  
The main goal of this study was to determine if adding a new drug (avelumab) b efore,
during ,and after standard treatment would increase the amount of time it takes f or 
cancer to worsen (progress).  The study also evaluated the overall safety of avelumab 
in combination with standard radiation and chemotherapy treatment.
WHAT HAPPENED DURING THE STUDY?
This study included 2 groups of patients taking either:
standard rad iation and chemotherapy treatment plusavelumab
standard radiation and chemotherapy treatment plusplacebo
A placebo does not have any medicine in it, but it looks just like the study medicine
and is given the same way .

3The study included adult patients who:
had squamous cell cancer of the head and neck (in the mouth or throat) that 
was locally advanced
had cancer that was likely to spread or come back after treatment
were appropriate to receive standard radiation and chemotherapy treatment 
with cisplatin
had not yet received treatment for their cancer  
had adequate liver, kidney ,and bone marrow function
The patients and researchers did not know who took avelumab and who took the 
placebo. This is known as a “ double -blinded” study.  
Potential pa tients were evaluated by the study doctor to make sure they met the 
criteria to participate in the study.  This was known as the “screening period”.  Next, 
eligible patients were randomly assigned to 1 of 2 treatment groups:
Group A (3 50patients): Standard radiation and chemotherapy treatment plus
avelumab
Group B (34 7patients): Standard radiation and chemotherapy treatment plus
placebo
Patients were assigned to each group by chance.  Putting people into groups by 
chance is called rando mization.  This helps make it more likely that the groups will be 
more even to compare before they start receiving the study treatments . 
Avelumab and placebo were given by intravenous (IV) infusion (a needle into a vein) .  
Thestudy included 3 treatment phases:
7-day Lead -In Phase: Patients received a single dose of avelumab or placebo on 
day 1
Chemoradiotherapy Phase: Patients received avelumab or placebo on Days 8, 
25, or 39 plus standard radiation and chemotherapy treatment
Maintenance Phase: Patients received avelumab or placebo every 2 weeks for 
up to 12 months

4Maintenance treatment means a treatment that is given to stop cancer from coming 
back after it has been treated in the initial phase .  
After the last dose of mainte nance treatment, there was a 90 -day follow -up period that 
included regular safety assessments .  There was a long -term follow -up period, which 
lasted until patients left the study or the study ended.
The figure below shows what happened during this study.
Patients were expected to be on treatment for about 15 months, but the entire study 
lasted about 3 years.  The sponsor ran this study at 196 locations in 22 countries in 
Asia, Australia, Europe ,and North America.  The first patient was enrolled on 
12December 2016.  575 men (82%) and 122 women (18%) joined the study.  Patients 
in the study were between the ages of 26 and 86. 
Patients were expected to complete the lead -in, chemoradiotherapy, maintenance, and 
follow -up phases of the study. The tables belo w show how many patients completed 
treatment phases and how many patients did not complete treatment phases either by 
their choice or because a doctor decided it was best for a patient to stop being in the 
study .

8WHAT WERE THE RESULTS OF THE STUDY?
Did adding avelumab b efore, during ,and after standard 
radiation and chemotherapy treatment increase the amount 
of time it takes for cancer to worsen (progress)?
To answer this question, the researchers compared the progression free survival 
(PFS), which is the time patients survived without their cancer getting worse.   At the 
time the study results were analyzed :
118 out of 350 patients in Group A (34%) had their cancer worsen or had died
106 out of 347 patients in Group B (31%) had their cancer worsen or had died
There was a 21% higher risk of cancer worsening in patients from Group A 
(avelumab andstandard treatment), compared to patients from Group B 
(placebo andstandard treatment)
The figure below shows the estimated chance of a patien t surviving without cancer 
getting worse, at month 24 of the study:
The study data was reviewed by an independent Data Monitoring Committee (DMC).  
DMCs are used to ensure the safety of study participants and to determine if it is 
appropriate for a study to continue.  There were no new or unexpected safety issues

9identifie d with avelumab.  However, the DMC concluded that there was little to no 
chance that the trial would demonstrate any benefit when adding avelumab to the 
standard radiation and chemotherapy treatment.  The addition of avelumab did not 
increase the amount of time it takes for cancer to worsen, and consequently the study 
was stopped early to give patients an opportunity to seek other treatments.
These are just some of the main findings of the study, and more information may be 
available at the websites listed at the end of this summary.  
WHAT MEDICAL PROBLEMS DID PATIENTS 
HAVE DURING THE STUDY?
The researchers recorded any medical problems the patients had during the study. 
Patients could have had medical problems for reasons not related to the study (for 
exam ple, caused by an underlying disease or by chance).  Medical problems could also 
have been caused by a study treatment or by another medicine the patient was taking.  
Sometimes the cause of a medical problem is unknown.  By comparing medical 
problems acros s many treatment groups in many studies, doctors try to understand 
what the side effects of an experimental drug might be.
In this report, all medical problems that occurred during the treatment periods are 
discussed, regardless of whether or not the study doctors thought that the medical 
problems were related to taking the study treatment.
Of the 348 patients in Group A who received st andard treatment andavelumab , 
345(99%) had at least 1 medical problem.  A total of 87patients in this group (25%) 
stoppe d taking study treatment because of medical problems.  
Of the 344 patients in Group B who received standard treatment andplacebo , 
342(99%) had at least 1 medical problem.  A total of 88 patients in this group (26%) 
stopped taking study treatment because of medical problems.
