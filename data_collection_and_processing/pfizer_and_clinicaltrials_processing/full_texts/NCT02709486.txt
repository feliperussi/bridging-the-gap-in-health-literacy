2WHY WAS THIS STUDY DONE?
Osteoarthritis is a common disease of the joints that can happen when the cartilage, a 
protective tissue that covers the joints, begins to wear down over time .  This can 
cause symptoms such as pain, tenderness, stiffness, and loss of flexibility in the 
affected joints.  It can also cause “bone spurs”, or extra pieces of bone, to form 
around the joints.
There is currently no cure for osteoarthritis, but doctors can prescribe medicines to 
manage pain and other symp toms.  These medicines may not work well for all 
patients with osteoarthritis, so researchers are looking for additional treatment 
options.   Tanezumab is being studied as a possible treatment option for osteoarthritis.  
Because it is still being tested, ta nezumab has not been approved for use in patients.
The main purpose of this study was to learn more about how tanezumab works to 
treat osteoarthritis symptoms .  The researchers wanted to answer this question:
Did patients who received tanezumab have an imp rovement in osteoarthritis 
symptoms ,compared to patients who received placebo?
A placebo does not have any medicine in it, but looks just like the medicine.  A 
placebo is also known as a “dummy drug”.
WHAT HAPPENED DURING THE STUDY?
This study compared 3groups of patients to find out if patients taking tanezumab 
would have an improvement in osteoarthritis symptoms .  To answer the research 
question, the researchers looked at 3 smaller questions :
Change in amount of pain due to osteo arthritis, from before study treatment to 
week 24of the study.
Change in amount of physical difficulty due to osteo arthritis, from before study 
treatment to week 24of the study.
Change in overall functioning, from before study treatment to week 24of the 
study.

3The study inclu ded adult patients with osteoarthritis in the hip or knee, who did not 
get adequate pain relief from certain other pain medicines, or who were unable or 
unwilling to take certain other pain medicines . 
First, p atients were screened by the study doctor to make sure they were appropriate
to join the study.  This was known as the “ screening pe riod”, which lasted up to 
37days.  During this time, X -rays of the joints were taken, and osteoarthritis pain was 
assessed.
The next part of the study was the “treatment period” , which lasted 24weeks. 
Patients were assigned to 1 of 3 treatment groups in very similar numbers .  Patients 
were assigned to each group by chance alone. Putting people into groups by chance 
helps make the groups more similar so they can be compared.
Study treatments were given as an injection under the skin (subcutaneously) . Patients 
received a total of 3injections during the study, 1 on the first day of the study ,a 
second one at week 8, and a th ird one at week 16 .
The study treatments included:  
Group 1: Tanezumab 2.5 mg 
Group 2: Tanezumab 5 mg 
Group 3: Placebo 
The patients and researchers did not know who took tanezumab and who took the 
placebo (dummy drug) ,since all treatment options looked the same .  This is known as 
a “blinded” study.  
At study visits in the clinic, starting at the screening visit, the patients completed 
questionnaires, like the questionnaires about pain from osteoarthritis, physical 
disability from osteoarthritis, and overall well -being that were used to answer the 
research question. They also let the staff know about illnesses and discomforts, and 
had assessments (like physical exam, blood pressure, and more) done by the study 
doctors and other qualified personnel.

4Finally , there was a follow -up period, which lasted 24 weeks.  During this time, the 
study doctors monitored the patients for any medical problems.  Patients did not 
receive study treatments during the follow -up period.  Thefigure below shows what 
happened during this study.
While patients were only in the study for about 4 8weeks , the entire study took about
2 ½ years to complete.  The Sponsor ran this study at 104locations in Europe and 
Japan .  It began 2 March 2016 and ended 14 November 2018.  262men (31%)and 
587women (69%) participated.  All patients were between the ages of 26and 8 9. 
Patients were to be treated for 24weeks . Patients were then to complete the 24 -week
follow -up period , during which time they did not receive study treatments . A total of 
849patient s joined the study and received study treatment.  Of the se patients ,726
(85.5%) finished the study .  There were 1 23patients (14.5%)who left before the 
study was over by their choice or a doct or decided it was best for a patient to stop the 
study.

5When the study ended in November 2018, the Sponsor began reviewing the 
infor mation collected.  The Sponsor then cr eated a report of the results. This is a 
summary of that report.
WHAT WERE THE RESULTS OF THE STUDY?
Did patients who received tanezumab have an improvem ent in 
osteoarthritis symptoms, compared to patients who rece ived 
placebo?
To answer this question, the researchers looked at the patients’ questionnaire results 
rating their osteoarthritis symptoms in 3 areas (pain due to osteoarthritis , physical 
difficulty due to osteo arthritis, and overall functioning) from before the start of study 
treatment and from week 24to see if there was an improvement .
On average, patients who rec eived tanezumab 5 mg had a greater improvement in all 
3 areas (pain due to osteoarthritis , physical difficulty due to osteoarthritis, and overall 
functioning) , compared to patients who received placebo .The researchers have 
decided that these results are not likely a result of chance.  
On average, p atients who received tanezumab 2.5 mg had a greater improvement in 
pain due to osteoarthritis and physical difficulty due to osteoarthritis, compared to 
patients who received placebo.  The researchers have decided that these results are 
not likely a result of chance.  Patients in this group also had an i mprovement in 
overall functioning, compared to patients who received placebo.  However, this result 
did not s how that tanezumab 2.5 mg was better than another treatment .  This 
difference could have been due to chance.
This does not mean that everyone in this study had these results . Other studies may 
produce different results , as well .  These are just some of th e main findings of the 
study, and more information may be available at the websites listed at the end of this 
summary.

6WHAT MEDICAL PROBLEMS DID PATIENTS
HAVE DURING THE STUDY?
The researchers recorded any medical problems the patients had during the study. 
Patients could have had medical problems for reasons not related to the study (for 
example, caused by an underlying disease or by chance). Or, medical problems could 
also have been caused by a study treatment, or by another medicine the patient was 
taking. Sometimes the cause of a medical problem is unknown. By comparing 
medical problems across many treatment groups in many studies, doctors try to 
understand what the side effects of an experimental drug might be.
During the treatme nt period, 467out of 849 patients (55%) had at least 1 medical 
problem .A total of 8(1%)patients left the study during the treatment period because 
of medical problems.   The most common medical problems during the treatment 
period are listed below.

WERE THERE ANY SERIOUS MEDICAL 
PROBLEMS?
A medical problem is considered “serious” when it is life -threatening, needs hospital 
care, or causes lasting problems .  
A total of 20out of 849patients (2%) in the study had serious medical problems
during the treatment period , including 8 patients (3%) who received tanezumab 
2.5mg,9patients ( 3%) who received tanezumab 5 mg, and 3patients (1%) who 
received placebo.
3patients died during the study.  2of these patients received tanezumab 5 mg and 
died during the treatment period.   The study doctors did not consider the sedeaths to 
be related to the study treatment. 1 patient received tanezumab 2.5 mg and died 
during the follow -up period.
