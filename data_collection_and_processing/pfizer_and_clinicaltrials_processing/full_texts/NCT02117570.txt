 2 WHY WAS THIS STUDY DONE? 
C difficile  is a type of bacteria that can cause serious infections.  It often shows up as 
antibiotic-associated diarrhea and is the most commonly recognized cause of 
infectious diarrhea in healthcare settings.  The number of C difficile  cases has increased 
recently, including in hospitals and nursing homes, possibly because of stronger 
strains of C difficile  bacteria and increased use of antibiotics. 
There is no approved vaccine to prevent primary C difficile  infection.  The 
investigational vaccine used in this study , PF-06425090, is an injection that helps the 
body produce an immune system response and potentially defend against a C difficile 
infection. 
 The purpose of th is trial was to find a safe dose of the PF-06425090 vaccine 
that caused few or no negative medical problems.  This is why 2 different dose 
amounts were studied.  Some volunteers received 3 injections of 100 µg 
(100 micrograms).  Others received 3 injections of 200 µg.  A third group 
received 3 injections of a solution with no active medication in it (placebo).   
o The placebo group was used to compare against the effects seen in 
volunteers who received the 2 different dose amounts of PF-06425090 
vaccine (100 µg and 200 µg). 
o  A previous study has already shown that the PF-06425090 vaccine can 
produce an immune system response against C difficile in humans. 
  This study was divided into 3 stages: 
o The first 2 stages tested the 2 dose amounts of PF-06425090 vaccine 
(100 µg and 200 µg) and placebo in volunteers who were between 50 and 
64 years of age (Stage 1) and 65 to 85 years of age (Stage 2).    
o Based on the findings in Stage 2, a third stage was planned to compare 
3 injections of the most effective (best immune response) and well 
tolerated dose of PF-06425090 vaccine (either 100 µg or 200 µg) with 
placebo in volunteers who were 65 to 85 years of age.  
 3 WHAT HAPPENED DURING THE STUDY?  
This study compared 2 different doses of PF-06425090 vaccine with placebo in 
volunteers who were 50 to 64 year of age (Stage 1) and then in volunteers who were 
65 to 85 years of age (Stage 2).  
The study was run at 12 sites across the United States.  It began on 28 July 2014 and 
ended on 28 December 2015.  The entire study took 17 months to complete because 
volunteers began at different times.  Stage 1 was completed before Stage 2 started. 
Volunteers were put into 1 of 3 groups (100 µg or 200 µg of PF-06425090 vaccine, or 
placebo) by chance alone.  This is known as a “randomized” study.  This is done to 
make the groups more similar for things like age and the number of men and women . 
Reducing differences between the groups makes the groups more even to compare.    
In this study, the volunteers were “randomized” at a 3:3:1  ratio.  This means for every 
3 volunteers who received 100 µg of PF-06425090 vaccine, 3 different volunteers 
received the 200 µg dose, and 1 other volunteer received placebo.  
In total, 184 volunteers took part.  42 volunteers started Stage 1, 27 volunteers were 
men and 15 were women.  142 volunteers started Stage 2, 56 were men and 86 were 
women.  An additional volunteer was randomized to one of the groups, but never 
received any injections. 
The study included: 
 People considered healthy following a medical examination 
 People with a long-term condition if it was stable 
 Women no longer able to have children (for example, they had been through 
the menopause or had surgery to remove their reproductive organs) 
Over the course of 30 days, volunteers received either 3 doses of 100 µg vaccine, 
3 doses of 200 µg vaccine or 3 doses of placebo on Day 1, Day 8, and Day 30.  All 
volunteers were followed for at least 12 months after their last injection.   
The volunteers and researchers did not know who was in each group.  Only the 
person who prepared the vaccine for injection knew who received which dose of 
vaccine or placebo.  This is called an “observer -blinded study.”    
 4 Stage 3 was planned but did not happen.  Vaccinations were stopped in Stage 2 after 
several volunteers who were 65 to 85 years of age had severe redness at the site o f 
their injection. 
 
In Stage 1, involving volunteers who were 50 to 64 years of age: 
 18 volunteers were in the 100 µg vaccine gr oup;  
 18 volunteers were in the 200 µg vaccine group;  
 6 volunteers were in the placebo group;  
o In total, 42 volunteers received dose 1, 42 volunteers received dose 2, 
and 41 volunteers received dose 3. 
In Stage 2, involving volunteers who were 65 to 85 years of age: 
 62 volunteers were in the 100 µg vaccine group;  
 60 volunteers were in the 200 µg vaccine group;  
 21 volunteers were in the placebo group;  
o In total, 1 42 volunteers received dose 1, 120 volunteers received dose 2, 
and 28  volunteers received dose 3. 
 
 5 As 7 volunteers had severe injection site redness in Stage 2 of the study, vaccinations 
were stopped.  This is why only 28 volunteers received the third dose.  Stage 3 of this 
trial did not happen. 
Out of the 184 volunteers in the study , 14 withdrew before it was completed (5 from 
Stage 1 and 9 from Stage 2).   1 volunteer in Stage 2, who received 2 doses of 200 µg 
PF-06425090 vaccine, withdrew after he had a heart attack and later died.  The study 
doctor determined the heart attack was not as a result of the vaccine.  
WHAT WERE THE RESULTS OF THE STUDY? 
Was PF -06425090 vaccine safe and acceptable (with no serious medical problems) in 
volunteers 50 to 85 years of age at either the 100 µg or 200 µg dose?  That was the 
main reason for this study (known as the primary endpoint).  A group who received 
3 doses of a placebo vaccine was used as a comparison. 
Results were based on volunteers’  reports in electronic diaries (e-diaries) and medical 
problems noted by the study doctors.   Among volunteers who were 50 to 64 years of 
age, who received either 100 µg or 200 µg doses of PF-06425090 vaccine, pain or 
redness of the skin at the injection site was the most common medical problem.  In 
nearly all cases these medical problems were mild and no volunteers withdrew from 
the study. 
Among volunteers who were 65 to 85 years of age, redness around the vaccination 
area (injection site erythema) was the most common medical problem.  6 volunteers, 
out of the total of 121 in the 2 vaccine groups, experienced severe redness.  None of 
them withdrew from the study as a result of the reaction.  However, following this 
finding, the Sponsor decided not to carry out Stage 3 of the study.   All volunteers 
were followed for 12 months after their last injection and no other safety concerns 
were noted.  
 6 WHAT MEDICAL PROBLEMS DID VOLUNTEERS 
HAVE DURING THE STUDY? 
The researchers recorded any medical problems the volunteers had during the study.  
Volunteers could have had medical problems for reasons not related to the study (for 
example, caused by an underlying disease or by chance ).  Or, medical problems could 
have been caused by a study treatment, or by another drug the volunteer was taking.  
Sometimes the cause of a medical problem is unknown.  By comparing medical 
problems across many treatment groups in many studies, doctors try to understand 
what the side effects of an experimental drug might be. 
In this study, in volunteers 50 to 64 years of age, 5 out of 18 who received the 100 µg 
vaccine, and 9 out of 18 who received 200 µg had at least 1 non-serious medical 
problem.  In volunteers 65 to 85 years of age, 22 out of 61 who received the 
100 µg  vaccine and 22 out of 60 who received 200 µg had at least 1 non-serious 
medical problem.  The most common are listed below.

PROBLEMS? 
A medical problem is considered “serious” when it is life -threatening, causes lasting 
problems or needs hospital care.   In total, 14 volunteers (8%) had serious medical 
problems.  10 of the volunteers received either 100 µg or 200 µg of PF-06425090 
vaccine and 4 of the volunteers received placebo.  None of the serious medical 
problems were considered by the study doctors or Sponsor to be related to the 
vaccine. 
Serious medical problems among volunteers who were 50 to 64 years of age:
o1 in the placebo group;
o2 in the 100 µg vaccine group;
oNone in the 200 µg vaccine group.
Serious medical problems among volunteers who were 65 to 85 years of age:
o3 in the placebo group;
o2 in the 100 µg vaccine group;
o6 in the 200 µg vaccine group.
One volunteer died during the study of a heart attack, but the study doctors and 
Sponsor did not consider this to be related to the PF-06425090 vaccine.
