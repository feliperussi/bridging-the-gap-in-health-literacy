2WHY WAS THIS STUDY DONE ?
Epilepsy is a condition in which a person has recurring seizures . Epilepsy occurs in 
both adults and children and can affect multiple daily life activities.   A seizure is a 
sudden increase in electrical activity in the brain. Seizures can cause many different 
symptoms, such as shaking, feeling confused, or losing control of your body.   When a 
seizure occur sthroughout the whole brain, it is known as a generalized seizure.  The 
most common type of generalized seizure is a primary generalized tonic -clonic 
(PGTC) seizure.  This is a disturbance in the functioning of both sides of thebrain. 
Participant s were asked to take part in this research study because they were 
diagnosed with epilepsy with PGTC seizures .
Pregabalin is the medicine that was used during this study.  Pregabalin is prescribed by 
doctors for the treatment of another type of seizure that w asnot part of this study, 
called partial onset seizures, in young children and adults.
The purpose of this study was to f ind out how 2 strengths of Pregabalin work to treat 
PGTC seizures, compared to placebo. A placebo looks like the study drug but does 
not contain any active ingredient.  A placebo does not have any medicine in it, but 
looks just like the medicine . 
In this document, Pregabalin and placebo wil l be referred to as “study drug ”.
WHAT HAPPENED DURING THE STUDY?
This study evaluate d3groups of participant s to find out which study drug may be
better for treating PGTC seizures: 
Pregabalin 5 mg/kg/day , or 5 milligrams for each kilogram of body weight per 
day, to a maximum of300mgper day
Pregabalin 10 mg/kg/day , or 10 milligrams fo r each kilogram of body weight
per day , to a maximum of 600mgper day
Placebo
The study included participant s between the ages of 5 and 65 years who were 
diagnosed with epilepsy with PGTC seizures.  All of these participant s were already 
090177e191f073f9\Approved\Approved On: 08-Oct-2019 08:12 (GMT)
3taking 1 to 3 other treatments for epilepsy (antiepileptic drugs to help prevent 
seizures ) in addition to Pregabalin or placebo.  Participant s continued to take their 
other antiepileptic drugs during the study.  
In this summary, results will be described by whether the participant was taking 
Pregabalin or placebo, although participant s were also taking other antiepileptic drugs.  
Participant s were assigned to each group by chance alone (like the flip of a coin) .  This 
is known as a “randomized” study.  This is done to make the groups more similar, 
which makes comparing the groups more fair.
The participant s and researchers did not know who took Pregabalin and who took 
placebo.  This is known as a “blinded” study.  This was done to make sure the results 
of the study could not be unfairly influenced by anyone. In case of urgent need, the 
study team could learn quickly which study drug the participant swere receiving.
The sponsor ran this study at 70locations in 21countries that included: Austria, 
Belarus, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, China, France, Greece, Hungary, India, 
South Korea, Malaysia, Montenegro, Poland, Romania, Russian Federation, Serbia, 
Slovakia, Turkey, Ukraine, United Kingdom, and United States .  It began 
03April 2013 and ended 20 February 2019.  A total of 98 (45%) males and 
121(55%) females participated.

4Participant s were in the study for a total of 21 weeks.  In the first 8 weeks of the study 
(baseline), participant s had tests and filled out forms to see if they qualified for the 
study.  Participant s were then to be treated for 13 weeks and then had the option to 
continue in the open -label study (the participant s and researchers know who is taking 
which study drug) , which is a separate study and not discussed in this report . 
A total of 85% (187 of 219) of theparticipant s who started the study finished the 
study .  A total of 15% (32 of 2019) of the p articipant s did not finish the study because
they left before the study was over by their choice ,a doctor decided it was best that 
they stop the study , and1 participant who received placebo died due to epilepsy .
When the stud y ended in February 2019, the Sponsor reviewed the infor mation 
collected.  The Sponsor then cr eated a report of the results. This is a summary of that 
report.
WHAT WERE THE RESULTS OF THE STUDY?
Did participant s who took Pregabalin have an improvement 
in seizure symptoms, compared to participant s who took 
placebo?
No, participant s who took Pregabalin did not have an improvement in seizure 
symptoms compared to participant s who took placebo .  Results could have been due 
to chance.
The main goal (or primary objective) was to see if Pregabalin reduced the number of 
seizures , compared to placebo.  Researchers compared the changes in a participant ’s 
number of seizures when they were being treated with Pregabalin or placebo .
In this study, on average, participant s who took 5 mg/kg/day Pregabalin had 
2%more seizures than participant s who took placebo.  Participant s who 
took 10mg/kg/day Pregabalin had 1% fewer seizures than participant s who took 
placebo .
This does not mean that everyone in this study had these results . Other studies may 
produce different results , as well .  These are just some of the main findings of the

summary.   
WHAT MEDICAL PROBLEMS DID 
PARTICIPANT SHAVE DURING THE STUDY ?
The researchers recorded any medical problems the participant shad during the study. 
Participant s could have had medical problems for reasons not related to the study (for 
example, caused by an underlying disease or by chance). Or, medical problems could 
also have been caused by a study treatment, or by another medicine the participant
was taking. Sometimes the cause of a medical problem is unknown. By comparing 
medical problems across treatment groups in many studies, doctors try to understand 
what the side effects of an experimental drug might be.
A total of 53% (40 out of 75) of participant s who took Pregabalin 5 mg/kg/day had 
at least 1 medical problem , 57% (41 out of 72) of participant s who took Pregabalin 
10mg/kg/day had at least 1 medical problem, and 50% (36 out of 72) of participant s 
who took placebo had at least 1 medical problem .A total of 17participant s left the 
study because of medical problems.  The most common medical problems are listed 
below.

6WERE THERE ANY SERIOUS MEDICAL 
PROBLEMS ?
A medical problem is considered “serious” when it is life -threatening, needs hospital 
care, or causes lasting problems .  
A total of 7 participant s had serious medical problems :3%(2 out of 75) of 
participant s in the Pregabalin 5 mg/kg/day group, 3% (2 out of 72) of participant sin 
the Pregabalin 10 mg/kg/day group, and 4% (3 out of 72) of participant s in the 
placebo group had serious medical problems .  There was 1 participant who received 
placebo and died during the study due to epilepsy .  The study doctor saidthat the 
death was not related to the study medicines.
