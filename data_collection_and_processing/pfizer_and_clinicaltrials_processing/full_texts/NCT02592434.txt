2WHY WAS THIS STUDY DONE?
Juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) is the most common type of arthritis in children.  
The term “idiopathic” means “of unknown origin”, and the term “juvenile” means 
that disease symptoms start before a person is 16 years old.  This disease causes 
swelling, pain, and stiffness in the joints.   JIA is an “autoimmune disease”, which 
means that patients with JIA have an overactive immune system that mistakenly 
attacks healthy parts of the body, such as the joints.  JIA can cause permanent damage 
to the joints if it goes unchecked, so researchers are looking for new treatment 
options for polyarticular course JIA. 
The study drug, tofacitinib, is an oral (taken by mouth) medication that has been 
approved to treat adults with other types of arthritis.  The body normally makes 
special proteins called “cytokines” that trigger activity in the immune system.  In 
patients with JIA, the body makes too many cytokines, which causes the immune 
system to become overactive.  Researchers think that the study drug works by 
lowering the amount of cytokines in the b ody, which helps to calm the activity of the 
immune system and decrease JIA symptoms.
The main purpose of this study was to find out if the study drug works to treat 
polyarticular course JIA.  Some p atients in this study also received placebo to find out 
if the study drug works in comparison with receiving no treatment at all.  A placebo 
looks just like the medication, but doesn’t have any medication in it.
Researchers wanted to know:
Didthe study drug work to prevent JIA flares, improve JIA symptoms, 
and ease or reduce overall disability compared to placebo?
To answer this question, researchers looked at how many patients had disease flares 
by the end of the study after being treated with the study drug, compared to patients 
who received placebo.  A flare is a sudden, temporary episode of pain and 
inflammation which is usually associated with tiredness, stiffness or joint swelling.  
Researchers also looked at how many patients had 30%, 50%, and 70% improvement 
in their JIA symptoms and if there was any chan ge in their overall disability by asking 
the patients or their parents certain questions.

3WHAT HAPPENED DURING THE STUDY?
This study consisted of 2 parts.  In the first part of the study, all patients received 
treatment with the study drug 2 times per day, for 18 weeks.  This was called the 
“run-in phase”.  Only the patients who had at least 30% improvement in their 
symptoms after the run -in phase took part in the second part of the study, called the 
“double -blind phase”.  
The double -blind phase of the stu dy compared 2 groups of patients to find out if the 
study drug works to treat JIA compared to placebo:
Study drug (tofacitinib): 5 mg tablets or oral solution (1 mg/mL) 2 times per 
day
Placebo: tablets or oral solution 2 times per day
The study included pa tients with JIA who were 2 years and older, but less than 
18years old.  The patient’s JIA symptoms had to start before they were 16 years old.  
Patients were assigned to one of the 2 groups by chance alone.  This is known as a 
“randomized” study.  “Randomization” is done to make comparing the groups more 
fair.
The patients and researchers did not know who took the study drug and who took the 
placebo during the study.  This is known as a “blinded” study.  This was done to 
make sure the results of the study could not be unfairly influenced by anyone.  In case 
of urgent need, the study team could learn quickly which study drug the patients were 
receiving.

4While each patient was only in the study for up to approximately 44 weeks, the entire 
study took almost 3 years to complete.  The Sponsor ran this study at 64 locations in 
14countries in different parts of the world .  It began 10 June 2016 and ended 
16May 2019.  In the run -in phase, 56 boys and 169 girls participated.  In the 
double -blind phase, 43 boys and 130 girls participated.  All patients were older than 
2and less than 18 years old . 
Patients were to be treated until the end of the double -blind phase, or until their 
symptoms worsened.  Of the 225 patients who started the study, 185 finished th e 
run-in phase.  Forty (40) patients left by their own choice or because a doctor decided 
it was best for a patient to stop the study.  Of the 185 patients who finished the run -in 
phase, 12 did not continue into the double -blind phase.
Of the 173 patients who started the double -blind phase of the study, 99 finished the 
double -blind phase.  Seventy -four (74) patients left by their own choice or because a 
doctor decided it was best for a patient to stop the study.
When the study ended in May 2019, the Sponsor reviewed the information collected.  
The Sponsor then created a report of the results.  This is a summary of that report.

5WHAT WERE THE RESULTS OF THE STUDY?
Did the study drug work to prevent JIA flares, compared to 
placebo?
Of the 72 patients treated with the study drug in the double -blind phase, 21 patients 
(29%) had disease flares by the end of the study.  Of the 70 patients treated with 
placebo, 37 patients (53%) had disease flares by the end of the study.  The researchers 
determined that these resu lts were not likely due to chance, and that the study drug 
may help prevent JIA flares.

6Did the study drug work to improve JIA symptoms, 
compared to placebo? 
At the end of the double -blind phase:
Thirty -nine (39) out of 72 patients (54%) treated with the study drug and 
26out of 70 patients (37%) treated with placebo had 70% improvement in 
their symptoms.
Forty -eight (48) out of 72 patients (67%) treated with the study drug and 33 out 
of 70 patients (47%) tre ated with placebo had 50% improvement in their 
symptoms.
Fifty-one (51) out of 72 patients (71%) treated with the study drug and 33 out 
of 70 patients (47%) treated with placebo had 30% improvement in their 
symptoms.  
The researchers determined that these results were not likely due to chance, and that 
the study drug may help improve JIA symptoms.

7Didthe study drug work to reduce overall disability, 
compared to placebo, based on the Child Health Assessment 
Questionnaire? 
In this study, patients treate d with the study drug in the double -blind phase had a 
greater reduction in disability compared with patients treated with placebo.  On 
average, their disability score improved by 0.09, while the placebo score slightly 
worsened, by 0.03, from the time of ra ndomization.  The study showed that these 
results were not likely due to chance, and that the study drug may help improve 
overall disability. 
This does not mean that everyone in this study had these results.  Other studies may 
produce different results, a s well.  These are just some of the main findings of the 
study, and more information may be available at the websites listed at the end of this 
summary.  
WHAT MEDICAL PROBLEMS DID PATIENTS 
HAVE DURING THE STUDY?
The researchers recorded any medical proble ms the patients had during the study.  
Patients could have had medical problems for reasons not related to the study (for 
example, caused by an underlying disease or by chance).  Or, medical problems could 
also have been caused by a study treatment, or by another medicine the patient was 
taking.  Sometimes the cause of a medical problem is unknown.  By comparing 
medical problems across many treatment groups in many studies, doctors try to 
understand what the side effects of an experimental drug might be.
One-hundred and fifty -three (153) out of 225 patients (68%) in the run -in phase had 
at least 1 medical problem.  In the double -blind phase, 68 out of 88 patients (77%) in 
the study drug group and 63 out of 85 patients (74%) in the placebo group had at 
least 1 medical problem.  A total of 26 out of 255 patients (12%) in the run -in phase 
left the study because of medical problems.  In the double -blind phase, 16 out of 
88patients (18%) in the study drug group and 29 out of 85 patients (34%) in the 
placebo group left the study because of medical problems.

8The most common medical problems for patients in the run -in phase were upper 
respiratory tract infection (24 out of 225 patients [11%]), headache (16 out of 
225patients [7%]), nausea (13 out of 225 patients [ 6%]), and vomiting (13 out of 
225patients [6%]). 
The most common medical problems for patients in the study drug group of the 
double -blind phase were upper respiratory tract infection (13 out of 88 patients 
[15%]), worsening of disease (8 out of 88 patients [9%]), and common cold 
(nasopharyngitis) (7 out of 88 patients [8%]).
The most common medical problems for patients in the placebo group of the 
double -blind phase were worsening of disease (13 out of 85 patients [15%]), JIA 
(12out of 85 patients [14%] ), and upper respiratory tract infection (9 out of 
85patients [11%]).
WERE THERE ANY SERIOUS MEDICAL 
PROBLEMS?
A medical problem is considered “serious” when it is life -threatening, needs hospital 
care, or causes lasting problems.  
Seven (7) out of 225 p atients (3%) in the run -in phase had serious medical problems.  
In the double -blind phase, 1 out of 88 patients (1%) in the study drug group, and 
2out of 85 patients (2%) in the placebo group had serious medical problems.  No 
patients died during the stud y.
