Clinical Study Results
This summary reports the results of only one study.  Researchers must look at the 
results of many types of studies to understand if a study medication works, how it 
works, and if it is safe to prescribe to study participants. The results of this study 
might be different than the results of other studies that the researchers review.

Why was this study done?
What is rheumatoid arthritis?
Rheumatoid arthritis, or “RA”, is a disease that causes swelling, pain, and stiffness in 
the joints.  RA is an “a utoimmune disease”, which means that patients with RA have 
an overactive immune system that mistakenly attacks healthy parts of the body, such 
as the joints.  RA can cause permanent damage to the joints if it goes unchecked .
What is tofacitinib?
Tofacitinib is a medicine that works to reduce the activity of the immune system.  It is 
an oral (taken by mouth) prescription medicine that is used treat adults with active, 
moderate to severe RA that did not respond well to medicines known as 
disease -modifying anti -rheumatic drugs (DMARDs), like methotrexate (“MTX”).  
Tofacitinib may help calm the activity of the immune system and decrease RA signs 
and symptoms. 
What was the purpose of this study?
Researchers did this study to learn more about the safety of 2 different doses of 
tofacitinib, compared to a tumor necrosis factor inhibitor (TNF inhibitor).  TNF 
inhibitors are another type of medicine that work to reduce the activity of the immune 
system. 
Cardiovascular disease is a disease of the heart or blood vessels.

What happened during the study?
How was the study done?
Participants were checked (screened) to make sure they were a good fit for the study. 
Participants who were a good fit were assigned by chance to receive either:
tofacitinib 5 milligrams (mg) twice per day by mouth,
tofacitinib 10 mg twice per day by mouth (these participants were later 
switched to tofacitinib 5 mg twice per day, due to new safety information 
about tofacitinib), 
or a TNF inhibitor (participants in the United States, Puerto Rico, and Canada 
received adalimumab 40 mg every other week by injection under the skin, 
participants in other countries received etanercept 50 mg once per week by 
injection under the skin) 
This was an “open -label” study, which means that the participants and doctors knew 
which treatment and dose the participants received.  
Participants were expected to attend visits at the study center for the baseline visit, at 
Month 2, Month 3, then every 3 months thereafter, and to complete an end -of-study 
visit, and an end -of study visit at least 28 days later.
The figure below shows what happened during this study.Researchers wanted to know: 
How many participants developed cancer?
How many participants developed cardiovascular disease?
How many participants had medical problems?

Where did this study take place? 
The Sponsor ran this study at 323 locations in 30 countries in Africa, Asia, Australia, 
Europe, North America, and South America.
When did this study take place?
It began on 14 March 2014 and ended 22 July 2020. 
Who participated in this study?
This study included adult men and women who:
Were 50 year s of age or older
Had moderate to severe RA
Had an inadequate response to treatment with methotrexate alone
Had at least one additional risk factor for cardiovascular disease
A total of 952 men (22%) participated

A total of 3 ,410women (78%) participated  
All participants were between the ages of 50 and 88 
Participants could continue taking study treatment as long as they continued to 
benefit from it, or until the study ended.  Of the 4,362 participants who started the 
study and received tre atment, 3,111 completed it.  
A total of 1,615 participants stopped taking study treatment early
by their choice, 
because they did not see significant improvement in RA symptoms, 
because they had a medical problem, or
because a doctor decided it was best for them to stop the study
How long did the study last?
The amount of time that each participant was in this study varied.  The entire study 
took more than 6 years to complete.
When the study ended in July 2020, the Sponsor began reviewing the information
collected.  The Sponsor then created a report of the results.  This is a summary of that 
report.

What were the results of the study?
How many participants developed cancer?
To answer this question, the researchers looked at the number of participants from 
each group who developed any cancer besides non -melanoma skin cancer during 
the study :
62 out of 1,455 (4%) participants who received tofacitinib 5 mg developed 
cancer.
60 out of 1,456 (4%) participants who received tofacitinib 10 mg developed 
cancer .
42 out of 1,451 (3%) participants who received a TNF inhibitor developed 
cancer.
How many participants developed cardiovascular disease?
To answer this question, the researchers looked at the number of participants from 
each group who developed cardiovas cular disease within 60 days of their last study 
treatment :
47 out of 1,455 (3%) participants who received tofacitinib 5 mg developed 
cardiovascular disease.
51 out of 1,456 (4%) participants who received tofacitinib 10 mg developed 
cardiovascular disease.
37 out of 1,451 (3%) participants who received a TNF inhibitor developed 
cardiovascular disease.
  These are just some of the main findings of this study.  Other studies may have 
different results.

What medical problems did participants have during 
the study?
The researchers recorded any medical problems the participants had during the study.  
Participants could have had medical problems for reasons not related to the study (for 
example, caused by an underlying disease or by chance).  Or, medical probl ems could 
also have been caused by a study treatment or by another medicine the participant was 
taking.  Sometimes the cause of a medical problem is unknown.  By comparing 
medical problems across many treatment groups in many studies, doctors try to 
unders tand what effects a study medication might have on a participant.
3,985 out of 4,362 (91%) participants had at least 1 medical problem within 28 days of 
their last study treatment :
1,333 out of 1,455 (92%) participants who received tofacitinib 5 mg had a 
medical problem.
1,344 out of 1,456 (92%) participants who received tofacitinib 10 mg had a 
medical problem.
1,308 out of 1,451 (90%) participants who received a TNF inhibitor had a 
medical problem.
A total of 684 out of 4,362 (16%) participants stopped tak ing study treatment because 
of medical problems :
199 out of 1,455 (14%) participants who received tofacitinib 5 mg stopped 
taking study treatment because of medical problems.
288 out of 1,456 (20%) participants who received tofacitinib 10 mg stopped 
taking study treatment because of medical problems.
197 out of 1,451 (14%) participants who received a TNF inhibitor stopped 
taking study treatment because of medical problems.
The most common medical problems –those reported by at least 10% of participants 
–are described below.

Below are instructions on how to read Table 1. 
Instructions for Understanding Table 1. 
The 1stcolumn of Table 1 lists medical problems that were commonly 
reported within 28 days of the last study treatment .  All medical 
problems reported by at least 10% of participants are listed.
The 2ndcolumn tells how many of the 1,455 participants taking 
tofacitinib 5 mg reported each medical problem.  Next to this number 
is the percentage of the 1,455 participants taking tofacitinib 5 mg who
reported the medical problem. 
The 3rdcolumn tells how many of the 1,456 participants taking 
tofacitinib 10 mg reported each medical problem.  Next to this number 
is the percentage of the 1,456 participants taking tofacitinib 10 mg who 
reported the medic al problem.
The 4thcolumn tells how many of the 1,451 participants taking a TNF 
inhibitor reported each medical problem.  Next to this number is the 
percentage of the 1,451 participants taking a TNF inh ibitor who 
reported the medical problem.
Using these instructions, you can see that 176 out of the 1,455 (12%) 
participants taking tofacitinib 5 mg reported shingles.  A total of 
167out of 1,456 (12%) participants taking tofacitinib 10 mg reported 
shingles. A total of 55 out of 1,451 (4%) participants taki ng a TNF 
inhibitor reported shingles.
