1CLINICAL TRIAL RESULTS
This summary reports the results of only one study.  Researchers must look at the 
results of many types of studies to understand if a study medicine works, how it 
works, and if it is safe to prescribe to patients.  The results of this study might be 
different than the results of other studies that the researchers review.

2WHY WAS THIS STUDY DONE?
Growth hormone is a substance that is needed for normal growth.  It is made by a 
small gland in the brain called the “pituitary gland”.  Some children have a condition 
called “growth hormone defici ency”, which means that their pituitary gland is not 
making enough growth hormone.  Children who are not treated for this condition 
may not grow and be as tall as other children of the same age .
Doctors may prescribe a medicine called Genotropin®(somatrop in) that helps 
children with growth hormone deficiency to grow.  Genotropin is known as a 
“recombinant human growth hormone”, which means that it is identical to the natural 
human growth hormone, but is made by scientists to be used as a medicine.  This 
treatment involves injections with a small needle under the skin, given each day .
Researchers have developed a recombinant human growth hormone called 
somatrogon.  It is given once per week instead of each day.  The purpose of this study 
was to learn more about the use of somatrogon in children with growth hormone 
deficiency.  Researchers wanted to know:
How much did a weekly treatment schedule with somatrogon interfere with the 
patient’s life, compared to a daily treatment schedule with Genotropin?
The stu dy also looked at the overall safety of somatrogon in children with growth 
hormone deficiency.
WHAT HAPPENED DURING THE STUDY?
This study compared the “treatment burden” (interference in child’s life) of a weekly 
treatment schedule with somatrogon, compare d to a daily treatment schedule with 
Genotropin.  The study included children between the ages of 3 and 18 years.  All 
children in the study had been diagnosed with growth hormone deficiency, had low 
levels of growth hormone, and were currently receiving d aily treatment with 
Genotropin for at least 3 months.
Children were evaluated by the study doctor to make sure they met the criteria to 
participate in the study.  This was known as the “screening period”, which lasted up 
to 30 days.  Next, eligible childre n were assigned to 1 of 2 treatment groups:
090177e1966a5759\Approved\Approved On: 03-Mar-2021 02:30 (GMT)
3Group A (43 children): 12 weeks of daily treatment with Genotropin, followed 
by 12 weeks of weekly treatment with somatrogon
Group B (44 children): 12 weeks of weekly treatment with somatrogon, 
followed by 12 wee ks of daily treatment with Genotropin
Children were assigned to each group by chance.  Putting people into groups by 
chance is called randomization.  This helps make it more likely that the groups will be 
more even to compare. 
The children, their parents, and the study doctors knew who took somatrogon and 
who took Genotropin during the study.  This is known as an “open -label” study.  
Study treatments were given at home as injections with a small needle under the skin .  
Children were expected to participat e in 7 study visits (over the phone or in person).  
At the beginning of the study and after each 12 -week treatment period, the children 
and their parents/caregivers were asked to complete a questionnaire about the 
treatment burden of Genotropin or somatrog on.  A follow -up phone visit was done 
4weeks after the last clinic visit.
The figure below shows what happened during this study.
Children were to be treated for 24 weeks.  The entire study took about 1 ½ years to 
complete.  The sponsor ran this study at 29 locations in 5 countries in Europe and the 
United States.  It began on 7 February 2019 and ended on 28 August 2020.  72 boys 
(83%) and 15 girls (17%) joined the study.  Children who joined the study were 3 to 
17 years old.

4Of the 87 children who started the study and received study treatment, 85 children 
(98%) completed the main part of the study.  2 children (2%) did not complete the 
study because of a medical problem or because they no longer met the requirements 
to parti cipate in the study.  
In August 2020, the Sponsor began reviewing the information collected.  The Sponsor 
then created a report of the results.  This is a summary of that report.
WHAT WERE THE RESULTS OF THE STUDY?
How  much did a weekly treatment schedule with 
somatrogon interfere with the patient’s life, compared to a 
daily treatment schedule with Genotropin?
To answer this question, the researchers used a questionnaire to assess the “treatment 
burden” (or how much the treatment interfered with the child’ s life) of weekly 
somatrogon or d aily Genotropin.  The children and their parents/caregivers were 
asked to complete the questionnaire at the beginning of the study, after the 12 -week 
treatment period with somatrogon, and after the 12 -week treatment period with 
Genotropin.
In this study, the children and their parents/caregivers reported that weekly 
somatrogon interfered less with their lives, compared to daily Genotropin.  Based on 
these results, the researchers have decided that the results are not likely the result of 
chance.  Weekly somatrogon may have a lower treatment burden than daily 
Genotropin.
This does not mean that everyone in this study had these results.  Other studies may 
produce different results, as well.  These are just some of the main find ings of the 
study, and more information may be available at the websites listed at the end of this 
summary.

5WHAT MEDICAL PROBLEMS DID CHILDREN 
HAVE DURING THE STUDY?
The researchers recorded any medical problems the children had during the study. 
Child ren could have had medical problems for reasons not related to the study (for 
example, caused by an underlying disease or by chance).  Or, medical problems could 
also have been caused by a study treatment, or by another medicine the child was 
taking.  Some times the cause of a medical problem is unknown.  By comparing 
medical problems across many treatment groups in many studies, doctors try to 
understand what the side effects of an experimental drug might be.
58 out of 87 children (67%) in this study had at least 1 medical problem.  1 child (1%) 
left the study because of medical problems.  The medical problems reported in at least 
5% of children during either treatment are listed in the table below.  The table shows 
the number and percent of children who exp erienced these medical problems during 
each treatment.
Most Common Medical Problems
(Reported in At Least 5% of Children During Either 
Treatment)
Medical ProblemDuring Genotropin
(86 Children Treated)During Somatro gon 
(87 Children Treated)
Pain at injection site 11 (13%) 13 (15%)
Bruise at injection site 8 (9%) 4 (5%)
Common cold 5 (6%) 6 (7%)
Headache 5 (6%) 6 (7%)
WERE THERE ANY SERIOUS MEDICAL 
PROBLEMS?
A medical problem is considered “serious” when it is life -threatening, needs hospital 
care, or causes lasting problems.

6No children in this study had serious medical problems, and no children died during 
this study.

Please remember that researchers look at the results of many studies to find out which 
medicines can work and are safe for patients.  Additional studies with somatrogon in 
children with growth hormone deficiency are ongoing.

We do research to try to find the 
best ways to help patients, and you 
helped us to do that!
