2WHY WAS THIS STUDY DONE?
Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a virus that can cause an infection with symptoms 
that are similar to a bad cold, such as cough, fever, sore throat, and runny nose. This 
infection can be very serious in infants and young children.
This study is about a vaccine called the “ respiratory syncytial virus stabilized prefusion 
F subunit vaccine ”, or RSVpreF .  A vaccine is used to help prevent infection by 
helping the body to fight off germs.  RSVpreF may be able to help prevent infections 
caused by RSV . 
After a vaccine is injected into a person’s body, the body responds to help fight 
infections and prevent diseases. The response to vaccines includes making 
“antibodies”, which are proteins that fight infec tions and help to prevent diseases.  
This is part of the body’s “immune response”.
The Sponsor of this study is developing RSVpreF for use in pregnant women.  
During pregnancy, vaccinated mothers may pass on antibodies to their baby.  So, 
RSVpreF may be able to help to prevent infections caused by RSV in infants if it is 
given to the mother while she is pregnant.
RSVpreF is an investigational vaccine, which means that it has not been approved for 
general use and it is not yet known if it will pro tect against disease caused by RSV .
The study participants may have received RSVpreF, Tdap vaccine (a vaccine against 
diseases called tetanus , diphtheria ,and pertussis), and/or placebo.  A placebo looks 
like the study vaccine but not does contain any act ive ingredients.  The purpose of 
this study was to learn about the safety of RSVpreF when given alone or together 
with Tdap , and to learn whether giving RSVpreF and Tdap together changes how well 
either vaccine works.

3Researchers asked these main questio ns:
One month after vaccination, did participants who received Tdap and RSVpreF
have a comparable level of Tdap antibodies to those who received Tdap and 
placebo?
One month after vaccination, did participants who received Tdap and RSVpreF
have a comparable level of RSV antibodies to those who received RSVpreF
and placebo?
To answer these questions, the researchers measured the amount of antibodies in  
participants’ blood 1 month after being vaccinated.
To learn about the safety of RSVpreF when given togethe r with Tdap or placebo , 
researchers asked these questions:  
What percentage of participants had “local reactions” (redness, swelling, or 
pain at the injection site) within 7 days after vaccination?
What percentage of participants had “systemic events” (fe ver, headache, 
tiredness, muscle pain, joint pain, nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea) within 7 days 
after vaccination?
What percentage of participants had medical problems within 1 month after 
vaccination?
What percentage of participants had serious medical pr oblems or medical 
problems that required treatment from a doctor during the study? 
WHAT HAPPENED DURING THE STUDY?
This study compared 5 groups of participants to learn about the safety of RSVpreF 
when given alone and together with Tdap in healthy, nonpregnant women, and to 
learn whether giving RSVpreF and Tdap together changes how either vaccine works.
Participants were checked (screened) to make sure they were a good fit for the study.  
This study included adult women who:
Were betwee n the ages of 18 and 49 years
Were not pregnant or breastfeeding
090177e19593bb30\Approved\Approved On: 20-Nov-2020 15:21 (GMT)
4Were considered to be healthy or with stable chronic disease by the study 
doctors
Did not have a disease or take medicine that would be associated with a 
weakened immune system
Had never rece ived any vaccine for RSV 
Had not received a DTaP or Td (tetanus and diphtheria ) vaccine within 5 years
Had never had an allergic reaction to any of the ingredients in the study 
vaccines
This was a “randomized” study, which means that participants were ass igned to 1 of 5 
groups based on chance alone. Randomization is done to make the groups similar so 
that differences in immune response or safety are most likely due to the different 
vaccines people received.  
This study was also “double -blinded”.  This means that participants and study staff 
members assessing safety did not know who was given which injection .  This was 
done to make sure that the study results were not influenced in any way.
The vaccine combinat ions were given as 2 injections at the same time (one in each 
arm). Some of the RSVpreF vaccines also contained aluminum hydroxide, an 
ingredient that is commonly included in vaccines to help make the immune response 
stronger. The combinations included:
Low dose RSVpreF and placebo (143 participants)
Low dose RSVpreF and Tdap (143 participants)
High dose RSVpreF + aluminum hydroxide and placebo (143 participants)
High dose RSVpreF + aluminum hydroxide and Tdap (143 participants)
Placebo and Tdap (141 parti cipants)
Participants were expected to participate in 2 study visits.  At the first visit, blood 
samples were collected, and the participants received the injections .  The second visit 
was done about 1 month after the first visit. Blood samples were collec ted, and 
participants were checked for any medical problems.  
The figure on the following page shows what happened during the study.

5While participants were in this study for about 4 to 5 weeks, the entire study took 
about 2 months to complete since not all participants entered the study at the same 
time.  The Sponsor ran this study at 16 locations in the United States.  It began 
01October 2019 and ended 11 December 2019.  All participants were women 
between the ages of 18 and 49 years. 
Of the 713 participants who joined the study, 709 (99%) received study injection s. A 
total of 695 participants (9 7%) completed both study visits, while 14 participants (2%) 
did not complete both visits and left the study early by their choice.
Throughout the course of the study, the Sponsor reviewed the data. When the study 
ended in December 2019 and after antibody testing was completed, the Sponsor then 
created a report of the results.  This is a summary of that report.
WHAT WERE THE RESULTS O F THE STUDY?
One month after vaccination, did participants who received 
Tdap and RSVpreF have a comparable level of Tdap 
antibodies to those who received Tdap and placebo?
To answer this question, the researchers measured the amount of antibodies in  
participants’ blood 1 month after vaccination.  They looked to see if the amount of 
antibodies that the body produced against tetanus, diphtheria , and pertussis were 
090177e19593bb30\Approved\Approved On: 20-Nov-2020 15:21 (GMT)
6comparable in participants who received Tdap and RSVpreF, and in those who 
received Tdap and placebo.
The researchers found that antibody levels against tetanus and diphtheria were 
comparable in participants who received Tdap and RSVpreF, and in those who 
received T dap and placebo.   However, antibody levels against pertussis were not 
comparable and were lower in participants who received Tdap and RSVpreF than in 
those who received Tdap and placebo.  Based on these results, the researchers have 
decided that the result s are not likely the result of chance.  
One month after vaccination, did participants who received 
RSVpreF and Tdap have a comparable level of RSV 
antibodies to those who received RSVpreF and placebo?
To answer this question, the researchers measured the amount of antibodies in 
participants’ blood 1 month after vaccination.  They looked to see if the amount of 
antibodies that the body produced against RSV was comparable in participants who 
received RSVpreF and Tdap, and in those who received RSVpreF and p lacebo.
The researchers found that RSV antibody levels were comparable in participants who 
received RSVpreF and Tdap, and in those who received RSVpreF and placebo.   Based 
on these results, the researchers have decided that the results are not likely the result 
of chance.
This does not mean that everyone in this study had these results.  Other studies may 
produce different results, as well.  These are just some of th e main findings of the 
study, and more information may be available at the websites listed at the end of this 
summary.

7WHAT MEDICAL PROBLEMS DID 
PARTICIPANTS HAVE DURING THE STUDY?
The researchers recorded any medical problems the participants had duri ng the study.  
Participants could have had medical problems for reasons not related to the study (for 
example, caused by an underlying disease or by chance).  Or, medical problems could 
also have been caused by study vaccine or by another medicine the part icipant was 
taking.  Sometimes the cause of a medical problem is unknown.  By looking at 
medical problems across many treatment groups in many studies, doctors try to 
understand what the side effects of an experimental drug (in this case experimental 
vacci ne) might be.
What percentage of participants had local reactions within 
7days after vaccination?
Redness, swelling, or pain at the injection site are known as “local reactions”.  The 
table on the following page shows the percentage of participants with l ocal reactions 
within 7 days after vaccination .

WERE THERE ANY SERIOUS MEDICAL 
PROBLEMS?
A medical problem is considered “serious” when it is life -threatening, needs hospital 
care, or causes lasting problems.  
What percentage of participants had serious medical 
problems or medical problems that required treatment from 
a doctor during the study?
1 participant (less than 1%) had a serious medical problem during the study, which 
was not considered to be related to the study vaccines .  This participant was in the 
high dose RSVpreF + aluminum hydroxide and placebo group .  No participants died 
or left the study because of a medical problem.
A total of 7 participants (1%) required treatment from a doctor for a medical problem 
during the study that w asunrelated to the study vaccines .
