Why was this study done?
What is respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)?
Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a virus that can cause an infection with symptoms
that are similar to a bad cold, such as cough, fever, sore throat, and runny nose. This
infection can be serious in older adults and in those with underlying medical 
conditions. People with serious RSV infection may have trouble breathing and may 
need to be hospitalized.
What is the RSV vaccine (RSVpre F)?
This study is about a vaccine called the respiratory syncytial virus vaccine, or 
“RSVpreF. ”A vaccine is used to help prevent infection by helping the body to fight 
off germs. RSVpreF may be able to help prevent infections caused by RSV .
RSVpreF conta ins proteins found in the virus that may stimulate the body’s response 
to make antibodies (known as the “immune response”), which may protect against 
RSV disease. There is no live virus in RSVpreF .
In older adults, immune responses decrease with age, so vaccines may require 
additional ingredients (known as “adjuvants”), which may improve the immune 
response against infection. 
RSVpreF used in this study contains either:
RSVpreF on its own, 
or RSVpreF with aluminum hydroxide, 
or RSVpreF with aluminum hydroxide and CpG adjuvant
Vaccines containing aluminum hydroxide have been used safely in vaccines for more 
than 70 years. Vaccines containing CpG have been given in research studies of other 
vaccines, and CpG is included in a vaccine approved for use in the U nited States to 
protect against hepatitis B (a liver virus infection). 
090177e197c5163b\Approved\Approved On: 10-Aug-2021 06:15 (GMT)
RSVpreF is an investigational vaccine, which means that it has not been approved for 
general use and it is not yet known if it will protect against disease caused by RSV. 
This study is the first time that RSVpreF with CpG adjuvant has been tested in 
people.
What was the purpose of this study?
The main purpose of this study was to learn about the safety of RSVpreF in healthy 
older adults. 
Researchers wanted to know:
How many of the study participants:
oHad redness, swelling, or pain at the injection site within 14 days of their 
first RSVpreF vaccination?
oHad nausea, vomiting, headache, muscle pain, joint pain, diar rhea, 
tiredness, or fever within 14 days after their first RSVpreF vaccination? 
oHad medical problems within 1 month after their first RSVpreF
vaccination? 
oHad serious medical problems or medical problems that required 
treatment from a doctor within 1 yea r after their first RSVpreF
vaccination?
What happened during the study?
How was the study done?
Researchers studied RSVpreF in healthy older adults to find out if participants had 
any health problems when given RSVpreF . This study was organized into 2 different 
cohorts, Cohort 1 and Cohort 2. Cohort is just another word for a group of people in 
a clinical study.
Participants in Cohort 1 also received a flu vaccine at the same time as RSVpreF.  
These participants were a ssigned to 1 of 8 treatment groups by chance alone :
090177e197c5163b\Approved\Approved On: 10-Aug-2021 06:15 (GMT)
Group 1: Low dose ( 60micrograms (μg))RSVpreF with aluminum hydroxide 
(32participants)
Group 2: Low dose ( 60 μg) RSVpreF with CpG and aluminum hydroxide 
(32participants)
Group 3: Medium dose ( 120 μg) RSVpreF with aluminum hydroxide  
(32participants)
Group 4: Medium dose ( 120 μg) RSVpreF with CpG and aluminum hydroxide 
(31participants)
Group 5: High dose ( 240 μg) RSVpreF with aluminum hydroxide 
(32participants)
Group 6: High dose ( 240 μg) RSVpreF wit h CpG and aluminum hydroxide 
(32participants)
Group 7: High dose ( 240 μg) RSVpreF with no aluminum hydroxide or CpG 
and aluminum hydroxide (32 participants)
Group 8: Placebo (An injection that does not have any vaccine in it, but it 
looks just like RSVpre F)(31 participants)
The first 4 participants were watched by study staff for at least 4 hours after their 
vaccination to monitor for any medical problems, and vaccination for the rest of the 
participants could begin no sooner than 2 days later. Vaccinatio n was also limited to 
no more than 6 participants per day for the first week of the study, and participants 
were followed up for 1 year after their first vaccination.
The figures below show what happened during the study.

Participants in Cohort 2 did not receive a flu vaccine during this study.  These 
participants were assigned to 1 of 2 treatment groups by chance alone .  At Visit 1, the 
participants received either:
Group 1: High dose ( 240 μg) RSVpreF with CpG and aluminum hydroxide 
(32participants)
Group 2: Placebo (31participants)
The participants then received a second dose of either RSVpreF or placebo 2 months 
later.
  
The researchers and participants from Cohort 1 and Cohort 2 did not know which 
vaccine they received. This is known as a “double -blind” study. 
Participants were expected to participate in 6 study visits over the course of 1 year. At 
the visits, blood samp les were collected, vaccines were given, and participants were 
checked for any medical problems.

Where did this study take place?
The Sponsor ran this study at 12 locations in Australia.
When did this study take place?
It began 05 June 2018 and ended 20 August 2020.
Who participated in this study?
Participants were checked (screened) by the study doctors to make sure they were a 
good fit for the study. 
This study included participants who:
Were 65 to 85 years old
Were males, or females not of childbearin g potential (able to have children)
Were considered to be healthy or with stable chronic disease by the study 
doctors
Did not have a disease or take medicine that would be associated with a 
weakened immune system
Had never received any vaccine for RSV 
Had not received a flu vaccine within the past 6 months (Cohort 1 only)
Had never had a severe medical problem or allergic reaction to any of the 
vaccine ingredients
Were informed of the risks and benefits of this study and agreed to participate
254 participa nts joined Cohort 1.  Of these, 250 (98%) participants were vaccinated 
and 247 (97%) participants completed the study. Two participants (1%) from Cohort 
1 left the study early by their own choice, and 1 participant (less than 1%) passed away 
for a reason t hat was not related to study vaccination. 
63 participants joined Cohort 2 and received the first vaccination. 57 (91%) 
participants received the second vaccination. 56 participants were withdrawn from 
Cohort 2 when the Sponsor decided to end the study early. Additionally,:
4 (6%) participants left the study early due to a medical problem
1 (2%) participant left the study early by their own choice
090177e197c5163b\Approved\Approved On: 10-Aug-2021 06:15 (GMT)
1 (2%) participant left the study early because they no longer met the study 
requirements
1 (2%) participant left the study early due to study doctor decision
In the overall group of participants:
A total of 145 women were vaccinated
A total of 168 men were vaccinated
All participants were between the ages of 65 and 85 years at the start of the 
study
How long d id the study last?
Participants were in the study for about 1 year. The entire study took almost 2 years to 
complete.
Cohort 1 was completed as planned. Cohort 2 ended early, 6 months after each 
participant had received their second vaccination. The Sponsor decided to end the 
study early because immune responses were not found to be different in the 
participants who received RSVpreF with CpG, compared to other RSVpreF 
formulations . This decision was not made due to any safety concerns. When the st udy 
ended in August 2020, the Sponsor began reviewing the information collected. The 
Sponsor then created a report of the results. This is a summary of that report.
What were the results of the study?
Didparticipants have immune responses?
All the RSVpreF formulations used in this study produced strong immune responses.  
The RSVpreF formulations containing CpG did not produce stronger immune 
responses than the other formulations , and participants who received a second dose 
of RSVpreF with CpG did not have stronger immune responses than the other 
participants .

How many participants had redness, swelling, or pain at the 
injection site within 14 days of their first RSVpreF vaccination? 
The graphs below show the percentage of participants in each vaccine group with 
redness, swelling, or pain at the injection site within 14days after their first vaccination. 
In Cohort 1, participants who received RSVpreF had higher rates of redness, swell ing, 
or pain at the injection site than participants who received placebo, but these were 
mostly mild.  In Cohort 2, these injection site effects were also mostly mild, and there 
was no increase in redness, swelling, or pain at the injection site after thesecond 
injection, compared to the first injection.

How many participants had nausea, vomiting, headache, muscle 
pain, joint pain, diarrhea, tiredness, or fever within 14 days after their 
first vaccination?
The graph below shows the percentage of participants with nausea, vomiting, headache, 
muscle pain, joint pain, diarrhea, tiredness, or fever within 14days after their first 
vaccination. Most participants reported these effects were mild or moderate.  
Participants in Cohort 1 received a flu vaccine at the same time that they received 
RSVpreF, but participants in Cohort 2 did not.

This does not mean that everyone in this study had these results. These are just some 
of the main findings of this study. Other studies may have different results. 
The researchers also examined what medical problems the participants experienced 
during the study. This information is provided in the next section.

What medical problems did participants have during 
the study?
The researchers recorded any medical problems the participants had during the study.  
Participants could have had medical problems for reasons not related to the study (for 
example, caused by an underlying disease or by chance). Or, medical problems could 
also have been caused by a study vaccine or by another medicine the participant was 
taking. Sometimes the cause of a medical problem is unknown. By comparing medical 
problems across vaccine groups in many studies, doctors try to understand what 
effects a study vaccine might have on a participant.
How many participants had medical problems within 1 month after 
their first dose of RSVpreF?
In Cohort 1, the following percentage of participants had medical problems within 
1month after their first dose of RSVpreF:
Group 1: Low dose ( 60 μg) RSVpreF with aluminum hydroxide: 22%
Group 2: Low dose ( 60 μg) RSVpreF with CpG and aluminum hydroxide: 22%
Group 3: Medium dose ( 120 μg) RSVpreF with aluminum hydroxide: 34%
Group 4: Medium dose ( 120 μg) RSVpreF with CpG and aluminum hydroxide: 
29%
Group 5: High dose (240 μg) RSVpreF with aluminum hydroxide: 26%
Group 6: High dose ( 240 μg) RSVpreF with CpG and aluminum hydroxide: 
23%
Group 7: High dose ( 240 μg) RSVpreF with no aluminum hydroxide or CpG 
and aluminum hydroxide : 22%
Group 8: Placebo: 17%
In Cohort 2, the following percentage of participants had medical problems within 
1month after their first dose of RSVpreF:

No participants left the study within 1 month after vaccination in Cohort 1 because of 
a medical problem. The most common medical problems in Cohort 1 –those 
reported by at least 2 participants –are described below in Table 1. Two of the 
medical problems that happened in participants from Cohort 1 –dry skin and 
reaction at injection site –were considered to be related to the vaccine by the study 
doctor.
The most common medical problem in Cohort 2 was limb injury , which was not 
considered related to the vaccine by the study doctor. Limb injury happened in 2 out 
of 29 participants dosed (7%) in Group 1 and 0 participants in Group 2. No table is 
included for Cohort 2, as limb injury was the only medical problem that happened in 
2 or more participants.
Below are instructions on how to read Table 1. 
Instruc tions for Understanding Table 1. 
The 1stcolumn of the table lists medical problems that were 
commonly reported during the study. All medical problems reported 
by 2 or more participants are listed.
The 2ndthrough 9thcolumns tell how many of the participants in 
each group reported each medical problem. Next to this number is the 
percentage of the participants in each group who reported the medical 
problem. 
Example: Using these instructions, in Table 1 you can see tha t 1 out of 
the 32 (3%) participants dosed in Group 1 reported dizziness, and 
1out of the 30 (3%) participants dosed in Group 6 reported dizziness.  
No participants in the other groups reported dizziness.
