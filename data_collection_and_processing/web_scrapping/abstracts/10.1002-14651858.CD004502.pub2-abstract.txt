Background
Family centred care is an important part of neonatal intensive care. Ensuring effective communication in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) is a challenge but is crucial to the implementation of family centred care. Providing parents in NICU with audiotape recordings of their conversations with neonatologists could promote effective communication. 
Objectives
The objective of this review was to assess the usefulness of providing parents of sick babies with audiotape recordings of their consultations with neonatologists. 
Search methods
The standard search strategy of the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group was used. This included searches of electronic databases: Oxford Database of Perinatal Trials, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, The Cochrane Library Issue 3, 2004), and MEDLINE (1966 ‐ February 2004); and previous reviews including cross references and expert informants. There were no language restrictions applied to the electronic searches. Hand searching of conference and symposia proceedings was restricted to the English language. 
Selection criteria
Randomised or quasi‐randomised trials of any form of providing parents of babies in NICU with audiotape recordings of their conversation with doctors in the NICU. 
Data collection and analysis
Four reviewers independently assessed the eligibility of the trials.
Main results
Our searches did not identify any trials which met the eligibility criteria.
Authors' conclusions
There is no information available from randomised or quasi‐randomised trials to demonstrate any benefits from providing parents in NICU with audiotape recordings of their conversations with neonatologists.
