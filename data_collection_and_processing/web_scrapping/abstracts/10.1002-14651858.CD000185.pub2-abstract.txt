Background
People with nonrheumatic atrial fibrillation (NRAF) who have had a transient ischaemic attack (TIA) or a minor ischaemic stroke are at high risk of recurrent stroke. 
Objectives
The objective of this review was to assess the effect of anticoagulants for secondary prevention, after a stroke or TIA, in patients with NRAF. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Stroke Group trials register (9 June 2003) and contacted trialists. 
Selection criteria
Randomised trials comparing oral anticoagulants with control (no therapy) or placebo in people with NRAF and a previous TIA or minor ischaemic stroke. Control groups on aspirin did not meet the selection criteria. 
Data collection and analysis
Both reviewers assessed trial quality and extracted data.
Main results
Two trials involving 485 people were included. Follow‐up time was 1.7 years in one trial and 2.3 years in the other. Anticoagulants reduced the odds of recurrent stroke by two‐thirds (odds ratio (OR) 0.36, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.22 to 0.58). The odds of all vascular events was shown to be almost halved by treatment (OR 0.55, 95% CI 0.37 to 0.82). The odds of major extracranial haemorrhage was increased (OR 4.32, 95% CI 1.55 to 12.10). No intracranial bleeds were reported among people given anticoagulants. 
Authors' conclusions
The evidence suggests that anticoagulants are beneficial, without serious adverse effects, for people with NRAF and recent cerebral ischaemia.
