Background
There are a number of effective interventions for the treatment of depression. It is possible that the efficacy of these treatments will be improved further by the use of adjunctive therapies such as inositol. 
Objectives
1. To determine the effectiveness of inositol in the treatment of depression.  2. To determine the adverse effects and acceptability of treatment with inositol. 
Search methods
The Cochrane Controlled Trials Register (CCTR), The Cochrane Collaboration Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Controlled Trials Register (CCDANCTR) incorporating results of group searches of EMBASE, MEDLINE, LILACS, CINAHL, PSYNDEX and PsycLIT were searched. Reference lists of relevant papers and major textbooks of affective disorder were checked. Experts in the field and pharmaceutical companies were contacted regarding unpublished material. 
Selection criteria
All randomised controlled trials that compare treatment with inositol, whether as monotherapy or adjunctive therapy, to an alternative treatment, whether another antidepressant medication or placebo, for patients with a diagnosis of depressive disorder (diagnosed according to explicit criteria). 
Data collection and analysis
Data were independently extracted from the original reports by two reviewers. Statistical analysis was conducted using Review Manager version 4.2.1. 
Main results
Four trials were identified, with a total of 141 participants. These were short term trials of double‚Äêblind design. The trials did not show clear evidence of a therapeutic benefit, nor any evidence of poor acceptability. 
Authors' conclusions
It is currently unclear whether or not inositol is of benefit in the treatment of depression. Ongoing studies should reduce this uncertainty.
