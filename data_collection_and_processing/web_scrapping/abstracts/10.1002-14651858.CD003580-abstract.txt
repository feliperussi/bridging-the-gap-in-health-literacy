Background
Thrombophilias, which are associated with a predisposition to thrombotic events, have been implicated in adverse obstetrical outcomes such as intrauterine growth restriction, stillbirth, severe early onset pre‐eclampsia, and placental abruption. Heparin administration in pregnancy may reduce the risk of these events. 
Objectives
The objective of this review was to assess the effects of heparin on pregnancy outcomes for women with a thrombophilia. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (July 2002), MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, Scidex (via OVID Technologies ‐ July 2002) and reference lists and personal files. We updated the search of the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register on 3 August 2012 and added the results to the awaiting classification section. 
Selection criteria
Randomized controlled trials comparing heparin with placebo or no treatment, or randomized controlled trials comparing any two treatments. Quasi randomized studies would be included. 
Data collection and analysis
Data would be abstracted from identified studies and recorded on a paper form by two reviewers. 
Main results
No studies were included.
Authors' conclusions
There are no completed trials to determine the effects of heparin on pregnancy outcomes for women with a thrombophilia.
