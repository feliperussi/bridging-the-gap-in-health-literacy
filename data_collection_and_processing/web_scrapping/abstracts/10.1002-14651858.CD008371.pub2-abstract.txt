Background
Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is a herpesvirus and the most common cause of congenital infection in developed countries. Congenital CMV infection can have devastating consequences to the fetus. The high incidence and the serious morbidity associated with congenital CMV infection emphasise the need for effective interventions to prevent the antenatal transmission of CMV infection. 
Objectives
The aim of this review was to assess the benefits and harms of interventions used during pregnancy to prevent mother to fetus transmission of CMV infection. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (31 December 2010). 
Selection criteria
All randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi RCTs investigating antenatal interventions for preventing the transmission of CMV from the mother to fetus during pregnancy and adverse outcomes in the congenitally infected infant. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently assessed studies for inclusion.
Main results
We identified six studies from the search. None of these studies met the pre‐defined criteria for inclusion in this review. 
Authors' conclusions
To date, no RCTs are available that examine antenatal interventions for preventing the transmission of CMV from the infected mother to fetus during pregnancy and adverse outcomes in the congenitally infected infant. Further research is needed to assess the efficacy of interventions aimed at preventing the transmission of CMV from the mother to fetus during pregnancy including a long‐term follow‐up of exposed infants and a cost effective analysis.
