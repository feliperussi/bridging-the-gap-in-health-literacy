Background
Antiepileptic drugs have been used in pain management since the 1960s; some have shown efficacy in treating different neuropathic pain conditions. Clonazepam, a benzodiazepine, is an established antiepileptic drug, but its place in the treatment of neuropathic pain is unclear. 
Objectives
To assess the analgesic efficacy and adverse effects of the antiepileptic drug clonazepam in neuropathic pain and fibromyalgia. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2012, Issue 2). MEDLINE, and EMBASE to 28 February 2012, together with reference lists of retrieved papers and reviews, and ClinicalTrials.gov. 
Selection criteria
We planned to include randomised, double‚Äêblind studies of eight weeks duration or longer, comparing clonazepam with placebo or another active treatment in chronic neuropathic pain or fibromyalgia. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors would independently extract data for efficacy and adverse events, and examine issues of study quality. 
Main results
We did not identify any studies that satisfied the inclusion criteria.
Authors' conclusions
This review uncovered no evidence of sufficient quality to support the use of clonazepam in chronic neuropathic pain or fibromyalgia.
