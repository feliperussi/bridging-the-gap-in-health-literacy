Background
Lobeline is a partial nicotine agonist, which has been used in a variety of commercially available preparations to help stop smoking. 
Objectives
The objective of this review was to assess the effects of lobeline on long term smoking cessation. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Group trials register (most recent search December 2011). 
Selection criteria
Randomized trials comparing lobeline to placebo or an alternative therapeutic control, which reported smoking cessation with at least six months follow‐up. 
Data collection and analysis
We extracted data in duplicate on the type of subjects, the dose and form of lobeline, the outcome measures, method of randomisation, and completeness of follow‐up. 
Main results
We identified no trials meeting the full inclusion criteria including long term follow‐up. One large trial failed to detect any effect on short‐term abstinence. 
Authors' conclusions
There is no evidence available from long term trials that lobeline can aid smoking cessation, and the short‐term evidence suggests there is no benefit
