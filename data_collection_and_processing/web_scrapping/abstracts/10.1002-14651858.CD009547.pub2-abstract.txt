Background
People with serious mental illness have consistently higher levels of mortality and morbidity than the general population. They have greater levels of cardiovascular disease, metabolic disease, diabetes, and respiratory illness. Although genetics may have a role in the physical health problems of these people, lifestyle and environmental factors such as smoking, obesity, poor diet, and low levels of physical activity play a prominent part. 
Objectives
To review the effects of dietary advice for schizophrenia and schizophrenia‐like psychosis.
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's Trials Register (September 09, 2013 and February 24, 2016). 
Selection criteria
We planned to include all randomised clinical trials focusing on dietary advice versus standard care. 
Data collection and analysis
The review authors (RP, KTP) independently screened search results but did not identify any studies that fulﬁlled the review’s criteria. 
Main results
We did not identify any studies that met our inclusion criteria.
Authors' conclusions
Dietary advice has been shown to improve the dietary intake of the general population. Research is needed to determine whether dietary advice can have a similar benefit in people with serious mental illness.
