Background
Antenatal maternal glucose administration has been suggested to improve the efficiency of antepartum fetal heart rate testing. 
Objectives
The objective of this review was to assess the merits or adverse effects of antenatal maternal glucose administration in conjunction with tests of fetal wellbeing. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (6 July 2012). 
Selection criteria
All published and unpublished randomized controlled trials assessing the merits of antenatal maternal (oral or intravenous) glucose administration in conjunction with tests of fetal wellbeing. 
Data collection and analysis
Both review authors independently extracted data and assessed trial quality. Authors of published and unpublished trials were contacted for further information. 
Main results
A total of two trials, involving 708 participants, were included. Antenatal maternal glucose administration did not decrease the incidence of non‐reactive antenatal cardiotocography tests. 
Authors' conclusions
Antenatal maternal glucose administration has not been shown to reduce non‐reactive cardiotocography. More trials are needed to further substantiate this and to determine not only the optimum dose, but also to evaluate the efficacy, predictive reliability, safety and perinatal outcome of glucose administration in conjunction with cardiotocography and also other tests of fetal wellbeing.
