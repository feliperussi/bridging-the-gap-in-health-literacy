Background
In a vaginal breech birth there may be benefit from rapid delivery of the baby to prevent progressive acidosis. However, this needs to be weighed against the potential trauma of a quick delivery. 
Objectives
The objective of this review was to assess the effects of expedited vaginal delivery (breech delivery from umbilicus to delivery of the head within one contraction) on perinatal outcomes. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (31 May 2015) and reference lists of retrieved studies. 
Selection criteria
Randomised trials of expedited vaginal breech delivery compared with delivery not routinely expedited in women undergoing vaginal breech delivery. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently assessed the one identified trial for inclusion.
If studies are included in future updates, two review authors will assess risk of bias, extract data and check data for accuracy. 
Main results
No studies were included.
Authors' conclusions
There is not enough evidence to evaluate the effects of expedited vaginal breech delivery.
