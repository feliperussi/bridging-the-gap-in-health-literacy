Background
Dislocation following hip replacement is associated with significant morbidity and functional cost. The cause is usually multifactorial. A variety of treatment options are available which can broadly be classified into operative and non‐operative. 
Objectives
To determine the best methods of treatment of recurrent dislocation following total hip replacement. 
Search methods
The following databases were searched until August 2006: MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Health Technology Assessment database (HTA), Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effectiveness (DARE), International Standard Randomised Controlled Trial Number Register (ISRCTN), and MetaRegister of Controlled Trials (mRCT). 
Selection criteria
Randomised and quasi‐randomised trials comparing operative and non‐operative treatments for recurrent dislocation following total hip replacement. 
Data collection and analysis
Two independent reviewers applied the inclusion criteria to identified studies.
Main results
Searches identified 269 studies. None fulfilled the inclusion criteria.
Authors' conclusions
The authors invite researchers to perform RCTs comparing different treatment options for recurrent dislocation of the hip. The heterogeneity of the population and variety of underlying causes would favour a multi‐centre study to achieve an adequate sample size.
