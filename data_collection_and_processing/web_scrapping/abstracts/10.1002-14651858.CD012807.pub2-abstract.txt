Background
Yoga is an ancient body‐mind practice which originated in India and is popular in the Western world as a form of relaxation and exercise. It has been of interest for people with schizophrenia to determine the efficacy of yoga delivered as a package of care versus non‐standard care. 
Objectives
To examine the effects of yoga as part of a package of care versus non‐standard care for schizophrenia. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group Trials Register (latest 15 May 2018) which is based on regular searches of MEDLINE, PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, BIOSS, AMED, PsychINFO, and registries of clinical trials. We searched the references of all included studies. There are no language, date, document type, or publication status limitations for inclusion of records in the register. 
Selection criteria
All randomised controlled trials (RCTs) including people with schizophrenia comparing yoga as part of a package of care with non‐standard care. 
Data collection and analysis
There were no data to analyse as no studies met the inclusion criteria.
Main results
The searches identified 30 studies that could be relevant to this review. After careful inspection, 29 were excluded and one is ongoing. No data were available for analyses. 
Authors' conclusions
In view of the lack of evidence from RCTs, it is currently not possible for us to comment on the use of yoga as part of a package of care versus non‐standard care.
