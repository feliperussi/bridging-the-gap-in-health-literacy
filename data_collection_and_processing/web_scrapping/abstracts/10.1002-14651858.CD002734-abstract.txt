Background
Bronchiectasis is characterised by chronic sputum production, bronchial wall dilation, recurrent infection and airflow limitation. Methylxanthines are used in the management of airflow limitation associated with asthma and COPD, where they are also purported to have anti‐inflammatory properties. In theory they may be of use in bronchiectasis. 
Objectives
To determine the efficacy of methyl‐xanthines in the treatment of bronchiectasis.
Search methods
The Cochrane Airways Group Specialised Register was searched using the terms: aminophylline, theophylline, methyl‐xanthine and synonyms. The most recent search was carried out in March 2010. 
Selection criteria
Only randomised controlled trials were to be considered.
Data collection and analysis
The results of the searches were reviewed by two authors. Searches yielded seven trials, none of which met the inclusion criteria. 
Main results
No randomised controlled trials were identified. An update search was carried out in March 2010. No further trials were identified for possible inclusion. 
Authors' conclusions
Further research is required to establish if the methyl‐xanthines have a role in the treatment of bronchiectasis.
