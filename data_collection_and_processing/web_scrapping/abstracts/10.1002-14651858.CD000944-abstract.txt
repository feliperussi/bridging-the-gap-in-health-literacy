Background
In many settings, symphysis‐fundal height measurement has replaced clinical assessment of fetal size by abdominal palpation because the latter has been reported to perform poorly. 
Objectives
The objective of this review was to assess the effects of routine use of symphysis‐fundal height measurements (tape measurement of the distance from the pubic symphysis to the uterine fundus) during antenatal care on pregnancy outcome. 
Search methods
Comprehensive electronic search of the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group trials register (August 2002). 
Selection criteria
Acceptably controlled trials comparing symphysis‐fundal height measurement with assessment by abdominal palpation alone. 
Data collection and analysis
One reviewer assessed trial quality and extracted data.
Main results
One trial involving 1639 women was included. No obvious differences were detected in any of the outcomes measured. 
Authors' conclusions
There is not enough evidence to evaluate the use of symphysis‐fundal height measurements during antenatal care.
