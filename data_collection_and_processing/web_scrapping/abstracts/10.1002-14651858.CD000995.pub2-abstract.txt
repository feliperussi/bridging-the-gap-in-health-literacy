Background
'The Alexander technique' is a taught form of therapy involving a series of movements designed to correct posture and bring the body into natural alignment with the object of helping it to function efficiently, and is reported to aid relaxation. Some practitioners claim benefits for those who desire greater ease and efficiency of breathing, including asthmatics. 
Objectives
The objective of this review was to evaluate the efficacy of the Alexander technique in people with chronic, stable asthma. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Airways Group Specialised Register, the Cochrane Complementary Medicine Field trials register and the bibliographies of relevant articles. The most recent search was run in June 2012. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials of Alexander technique (AT) for the improvement of the symptoms of chronic, stable asthma, comparing the treatment with either another intervention or no intervention. 
Data collection and analysis
No trials were found that met the selection criteria.
Main results
No meta‐analysis could be performed.
Authors' conclusions
Robust, well‐designed randomised controlled trials are required in order to test claims by practitioners that AT can have a positive effect on the symptoms of chronic asthma and thereby help people with asthma to reduce medication.
