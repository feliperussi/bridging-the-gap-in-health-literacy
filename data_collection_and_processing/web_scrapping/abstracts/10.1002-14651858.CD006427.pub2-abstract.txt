Background
Bronchiectasis is increasing recognised as a co‚Äêmorbidity in many respiratory illness. Anti inflammatory drugs may reduce the inflammatory cascade and thus reduce symptoms and slow long term pulmonary decline. 
Objectives
To assess the role of non steroid anti inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) on symptom control and natural history of the disease in children and adults with bronchiectasis. 
Search methods
The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), the Cochrane Airways Group Specialised Register, MEDLINE and EMBASE databases were searched by the Cochrane Airways Group up to December 2008. 
Selection criteria
Only randomised controlled trials were considered. Patients with radiological or clinical evidence of bronchiectasis were included. Patients with Cystic Fibrosis were excluded. 
Data collection and analysis
The titles, abstracts and citations were independently reviewed by two reviewers to assess potential relevance for full review. No eligible trials were identified and thus no data were available for analysis. 
Main results
No randomised or controlled trials were found.
Authors' conclusions
There are no randomised controlled that examined the effect of oral NSAIDs in patients with bronchiectasis. In view of some benefit shown by inhaled NSAIDs in bronchiectasis, RCTs are clearly needed to study the beneficial effect of oral NSAIDs in patients with bronchiectasis.
