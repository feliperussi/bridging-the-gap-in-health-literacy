Background
It has been suggested that oestrogens may improve fetal growth due to an increase in nutritional supply to the fetus from greater uterine blood flow. 
Objectives
The objective of this review was to assess the effects of hormone administration for suspected impaired fetal growth and perinatal outcome. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (June 2009).
Selection criteria
Acceptably controlled trials of hormone administration for suspected impaired fetal growth which report fetal, perinatal or maternal outcomes. 
Data collection and analysis
Eligibility and trial quality were assessed.
Main results
No studies were included since none of the potentially relevant trials reported clinical outcomes. 
Authors' conclusions
There is not enough evidence to evaluate the clinical use of hormone administration for suspected impaired fetal growth.
