Background
Malignant, or necrotising, otitis externa is a potentially fatal infection of the external ear canal and surrounding soft tissue and bone. It may be complicated by involvement of cranial nerves, principally the facial nerves and the contents of the jugular foramen. It is an uncommon condition mainly found in the elderly or in diabetics. 
Objectives
To assess the effectiveness of adjunctive hyperbaric oxygen treatment for malignant otitis externa. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Ear, Nose and Throat Disorders Group Trials Register; the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); PubMed; EMBASE; CINAHL; Web of Science; ICTRP and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. The date of the most recent search was 4 April 2013. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials, involving adults, undergoing hyperbaric oxygen therapy in malignant otitis externa. 
Data collection and analysis
No identified articles described randomised controlled trials of hyperbaric oxygen therapy in the treatment of malignant otitis externa. 
Main results
Due to the lack of data we could present no results.
Authors' conclusions
No clear evidence exists to demonstrate the efficacy of hyperbaric oxygen therapy when compared to treatment with antibiotics and/or surgery. We found no data to compare rates of complication between the different treatment modalities. Further research is required.
