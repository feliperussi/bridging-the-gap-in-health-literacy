Background
Standard treatment for bronchiectasis comprises postural drainage and various regimes of antibiotic therapy. If the disease is confined to localised areas of lung, surgical resection of the affected segments is often performed. 
Objectives
To assess the benefit of surgical resection compared with standard ("conservative") treatment. 
Search methods
The Cochrane Airways Group Specialised Register of trials was searched up to May 2011.
Selection criteria
Only randomised, controlled trials were considered
Data collection and analysis
The titles, abstracts and citations were independently reviewed by the two reviewers to assess potential relevance for full review. 
Main results
No randomised or controlled clinical trials were found, other than case series or case‚Äêcontrolled studies. Subsequent update searches have failed to identify any trials. 
Authors' conclusions
Surgical treatment of bronchiectasis is widely used, but there appear to be no randomised controlled trials. It is not possible to provide an unbiased estimate of its benefit compared to conservative therapy .
