Background
Neonatal circumcision is a fairly common surgical procedure that may be carried out for medical reasons, one of them being prevention of urinary tract infections (UTI) in male infants. Circumcision could help in reducing the incidence of UTI by reducing periurethral bacterial colonization, which is accepted as a potential risk factor in UTI. Evidence is needed to inform the benefits or harm for the routine use of this intervention. 
Objectives
To assess the effectiveness and safety of routine neonatal circumcision for the prevention of UTIs in infancy. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group Trials Register comprising references identified from comprehensive electronic database searches and handsearches of relevant journals and abstract books of conference proceedings. We completed this search 30 June 2011. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials and quasi‚Äêrandomised controlled trials.
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors had planned to independently screen studies, extract data and assess risk of bias using standard Cochrane Collaboration methodologies. We did not identify any studies for inclusion in this review. 
Main results
We did not identify any relevant studies after a comprehensive search of the literature.
Authors' conclusions
We were unable to identify any randomised controlled trials on the use of routine neonatal circumcision for prevention of UTI in male infants. Until further evidence becomes available, clinicians should continue to base their decisions on position statements and recommendations and in conjunction with the opinions of the children's parents.
