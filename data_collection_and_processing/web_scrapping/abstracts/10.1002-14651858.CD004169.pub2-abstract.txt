Background
Hypotonic saline (such as 0.18âˆ’0.3% NaCl with dextrose) is commonly used as maintenance fluid in the management of acute infections. In recent years there have been numerous reports of hypotonic saline solutions being associated with adverse outcomes. To reduce the rates of adverse outcomes, use of isotonic saline as maintenance fluid has been proposed. 
Objectives
To assess adverse events and benefits associated with infusion of hypotonic saline compared with isotonic saline solutions in the management of acute infections. 
Search methods
We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register, Current Controlled Trials and the Specialised Register of the Injuries Group. 
Selection criteria
Randomised trials comparing hypotonic saline to isotonic saline in the management of acute infections. 
Data collection and analysis
Three reviewers independently evaluated all potentially relevant articles, examined each study for possible inclusion and assessed the methodology quality using the Cochrane guidelines. 
Main results
No trials met our inclusion criteria.
Authors' conclusions
Although there is ample evidence elsewhere that administration of large volumes of hypotonic fluids has led to severe hyponatraemia and adverse neurological outcomes in many patients with a variety of medical and surgical conditions, we found no randomised controlled trials investigating whether use of isotonic saline as maintenance fluid in those who require intravenous fluid would a be safer alternative. Careful research with adequate design and sample sizes is needed to evaluate the benefits and safety of using isotonic saline as maintenance fluid in a variety of acute clinical conditions.
