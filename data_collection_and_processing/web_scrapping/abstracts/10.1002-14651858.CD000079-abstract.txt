Background
Transcutaneous electrostimulation is thought to be able to improve blood flow and so it has been suggested that it may help to promote fetal growth. 
Objectives
The objective was to assess the effects of transcutaneous electrostimulation in suspected placental insufficiency on the promotion of fetal growth. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (June 2009).
Selection criteria
Acceptably controlled trials of transcutaneous electrostimulation compared with placebo or no treatment in women with suspected impaired fetal growth or placental insufficiency. 
Data collection and analysis
Trial quality was assessed.
Main results
No studies were included.
Authors' conclusions
There is not enough evidence to evaluate the use of transcutaneous electrostimulation in the management of women with suspected placental insufficiency.
