Background
Involvement of hepatic lymph node in patients with colorectal liver metastases is associated with poor prognosis. 
Objectives
To determine the benefits and harms of curative liver resection with lymphadenectomy versus other treatments for colorectal liver metastases with hepatic node involvement. 
Search methods
We searched The Cochrane Hepato‐Biliary Group Controlled Trials Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) in The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, Science Citation Index Expanded, and LILACS until September 2009 for identifying the randomised trials. 
Selection criteria
We considered only randomised clinical trials (irrespective of language, blinding, or publication status) comparing liver resection (alone or in combination with radiofrequency ablation or cryoablation) versus other treatments (neo‐adjuvant chemotherapy, chemotherapy, or radiofrequency ablation) in patients with colorectal liver metastases with hepatic node involvement. 
Data collection and analysis
Two authors independently identified trials for inclusion.
Main results
We were unable to identify any randomised clinical trial fulfilling the inclusion criteria of this review. We were also unable to identify any quasi‐randomised or cohort studies, which could meaningfully answer this important issue. 
Authors' conclusions
There is no evidence in the literature to assess the role of surgery versus other treatments for patients with colorectal liver metastases with hepatic node involvement. High quality randomised clinical trials are feasible and are necessary to determine the optimal management of patients with colorectal liver metastases with hepatic node involvement.
