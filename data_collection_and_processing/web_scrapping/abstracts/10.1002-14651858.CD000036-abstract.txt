Background
Betamimetic drugs may promote fetal growth by increasing the availability of nutrients and by decreasing vascular resistance. They may also induce adverse effects via their effects on carbohydrate metabolism. 
Objectives
The objective of this review was to assess the effects of betamimetic therapy for suspected impaired fetal growth on fetal growth and perinatal outcome. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (June 2009).
Selection criteria
Randomized trials of betamimetic therapy compared with no betamimetic therapy or placebo in women with suspected impaired fetal growth. 
Data collection and analysis
Eligibility and trial quality was assessed.
Main results
Two studies of 118 women were included. No statistically significant differences were found between the betamimetic groups and the control groups for low birthweight (risk ratio 1.17, 95% confidence interval 0.75 to 1.83), other anthropometric measures or neonatal morbidity and mortality. 
Authors' conclusions
Larger, well‚Äêdesigned studies are needed to evaluate the effects of betamimetics on fetal growth. Since there is potential for adverse effects due to the pharmacological characteristics of this group of drugs, data related to any potential harms should be collected in addition to beneficial effects.
