Background
Diaphyseal forearm fractures in children are common injuries, the vast majority of which are treated conservatively. There is a need to assess the role of modifiable factors such as techniques of reduction and casting in order to optimise functional recovery. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of different conservative interventions for diaphyseal forearm fractures in children, including adolescents. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Bone, Joint and Muscle Trauma Group Specialised Register (to November 2012), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library, 2012 Issue 11), MEDLINE (1950 to November 2012), EMBASE (1980 to November 2012), CINAHL (1982 to November 2012), trial registries (to November 2012), conference proceedings and reference lists of articles. 
Selection criteria
Randomised or quasi‚Äêrandomised trials comparing conservative interventions for diaphyseal forearm fractures in children were eligible for inclusion. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently examined search results to identify eligible trials.
Main results
After screening 493 citations, 17 potentially eligible studies were identified. Of these 13 studies were excluded, two studies, both reported incompletely in conference abstracts only, await assessment and two are ongoing trials whose recruitment status is unknown. 
Authors' conclusions
This review found no usable evidence from randomised trials to make recommendations concerning different conservative interventions for the treatment of diaphyseal fractures of the forearm bones in children. Publication in full of trials that have already been performed on this topic would be a useful start to changing this unsatisfactory situation.
