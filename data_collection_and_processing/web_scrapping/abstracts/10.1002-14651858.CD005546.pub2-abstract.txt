Background
Observational studies have generally not provided evidence that delivery by caesarean section reduces perinatal hepatitis C virus (HCV) transmission. However, these studies have methodological weaknesses with potential for bias and their findings should be interpreted with caution. 
Objectives
To assess the evidence from randomised controlled trials that a policy of delivery by planned caesarean section versus vaginal delivery reduces mother to infant HCV transmission. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (March 2010).
Selection criteria
Controlled trials using random or quasi‚Äêrandom participant allocation that compared a policy of planned elective caesarean section versus vaginal birth for mothers with HCV infection. 
Data collection and analysis
We did not identify any randomised controlled trials.
Main results
We did not identify any randomised controlled trials.
Authors' conclusions
Currently, there is no evidence from randomised controlled trials upon which to base any practice recommendations regarding planned caesarean section versus vaginal delivery for preventing mother to infant hepatitis C virus transmission. In the absence of trial data, evidence to inform women and carers is only available from observational studies that are subject to biases. Systematic review of these studies is needed. There is a need to determine whether women and healthcare providers would support a large pragmatic randomised controlled trial to provide evidence regarding the benefits and harms of planned elective caesarean section versus planned vaginal birth for women with HCV infection.
