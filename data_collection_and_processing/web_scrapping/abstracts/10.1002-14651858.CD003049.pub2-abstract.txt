Background
Community animal health services in low‐income countries aim to improve the health of animals and directly improve the wealth and health or livelihood of their owners. These services have been promoted by aid organizations since the 1970s. 
Objectives
To summarize reliable research of community animal health services on indicators for household wealth and health. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group Specialized Register (January 2011), CENTRAL (The Cochrane Library 2010, Issue 4), MEDLINE (1966 to January 2011), AGRIS (1975 to January 2011), Science Citation Index (2000 to January 2011), STN SIGLE database (1976 to 2011), and AGRICOLA (January 2011). We contacted relevant researchers and organizations, and also checked the reference lists of articles. 
Selection criteria
Randomized controlled trials and controlled before‐and‐after studies comparing community animal health services with no community animal health services or with an alternative animal health service. 
Data collection and analysis
We independently assessed studies for inclusion in the review.
Main results
No studies met the inclusion criteria.
Authors' conclusions
Well‐designed randomized controlled trials or controlled before‐and‐after studies that use standard pragmatic outcomes are needed to evaluate the positive results reported by observational studies.
