Background
Gestational hypertension and pre‐eclampsia can cause fluid shifts. Pulmonary oedema and renal failure can result from these shifts. Fluid management is crucial in managing pre‐eclampsia, especially in the context of pulmonary oedema and renal failure. Pulmonary artery catheterisation may be a method of effectively monitoring fluid status and thus aid in the management of renal failure and pulmonary oedema in the context of pre‐eclampsia. 
Objectives
To assess the safety and efficacy of pulmonary flow catheters in women with severe pre‐eclampsia in preventing and managing of renal failure and pulmonary oedema or both. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (30 April 2012). 
Selection criteria
Randomised trials evaluating the use of the pulmonary artery catheterisation in the management of pre‐eclamptic and eclamptic antepartum, intrapartum and postpartum women. 
Data collection and analysis
We did not identify any randomised controlled studies.
Main results
There are no included studies.
Authors' conclusions
There is currently no evidence from randomised controlled trials supporting the use of the pulmonary artery catheters. Fluid management in pre‐eclampsia, especially in the context of preventing or managing renal failure and pulmonary oedema, remains an important issue. Randomised trials dealing with this intervention are needed, however, we do recognise the difficulty in performing randomised trials due to the invasive nature of the procedure and skills involved in inserting a pulmonary flow catheter.
