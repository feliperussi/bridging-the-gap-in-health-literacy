This review is out of date, but is correct at the date of publication. The review has been withdrawn from The Cochrane Library, but readers can still access previous versions in the 'Other versions' tab. The original author team is preparing three new protocols which will serve to update and replace this review: Manual treatment and spinal rehabilitative exercise for the prevention of migraine attacks in adults, Manual treatment and spinal rehabilitative exercise for the prevention of TTH in adults, and Manual treatment and spinal rehabilitative exercise for the prevention of cervicogenic headaches in adults.
