Background
Since the condition was first described in 1965, the syndrome of normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH) has conventionally been managed by placement of a cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) shunt. 
Objectives
To determine the effectiveness of shunting procedures in promoting stability or improvement in the neurological symptoms and signs of NPH. 
Search methods
The Specialized Register of the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group (CDCIG), The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL and LILACS were searched on 27 March 2008 using the terms: "Shunt*" AND "normal pressure hydrocephalus". The CDCIG Specialized Register contains records from all major health care databases (The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, LILACS) as well as from many trials databases and grey literature sources. 
Selection criteria
Studies included for analysis were those involving the placement of a CSF shunt for the treatment of NPH as part of a randomized controlled trial. 
Data collection and analysis
No data matching the selection criteria were found.
Main results
No randomized controlled trials of shunt placement versus no shunt were found.
Authors' conclusions
There is no evidence to indicate whether placement of a shunt is effective in the management of NPH.
