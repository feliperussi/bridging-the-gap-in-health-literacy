Background
Primary delusional infestation (DI) is a primary psychiatric disorder characterised by delusions and abnormal tactile sensations. The pathophysiology is undecided and treatment includes both pharmacological and non‐pharmacological options. There is currently no Cochrane Review of the treatments used. Primary DI is a diagnosis often encountered by both dermatologists and psychiatrists, with a large associated disease burden. 
Objectives
To evaluate the effectiveness of different treatments in primary delusional infestation (DI). 
Search methods
On 24 December 2014 and 19 March 2019, we searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group’s Study‐Based Register of Trials including registries of clinical trials. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials involving the treatment of adults with primary DI.
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently screened and assessed studies for inclusion using pre‐specified inclusion criteria. 
Main results
We did not identify any studies for inclusion.
Authors' conclusions
Currently there is no evidence from RCTs available to compare treatment of primary DI with placebo. We cannot, therefore, make any conclusions regarding the effects of treatments (pharmacological or non‐pharmacological) for primary DI. This lack of evidence for treatment of primary DI has implications for research and practice. Robust randomised trials are indicated.
