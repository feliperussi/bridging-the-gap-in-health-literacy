Background
Fragile X is the most common cause of mental retardation after Down syndrome. It is the commonest inherited cause of mental retardation, and results from a dynamic mutation in a gene on the long arm of the X chromosome. Various strategies are used for prenatal screening. 
Objectives
To determine whether preconceptional or antenatal screening for fragile X carrier status in apparently low‚Äêrisk women confers any additional benefit over the existing practice of offering testing to women thought to be at increased risk. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (October 2008). 
Selection criteria
Randomised clinical trials comparing women being tested regardless of family history (intervention group) with women tested only when there is a family history of either fragile X and/or other undiagnosed mental illness/impairment (control group). 
Data collection and analysis
Three review authors independently assessed trial quality.
Main results
No trials were included.
Authors' conclusions
No information is available from randomised trials to indicate whether routine preconceptional or antenatal screening for fragile X carrier status confers any benefit over testing women thought to be at increased risk.
