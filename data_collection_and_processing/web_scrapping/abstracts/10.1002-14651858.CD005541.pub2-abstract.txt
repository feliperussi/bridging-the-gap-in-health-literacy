Background
Neonates from isoimmunized pregnancies have increased morbidity from neonatal jaundice. The increased bilirubin from haemolysis often needs phototherapy, exchange transfusion or both after birth. Various trials in pregnant women who were not isoimmunized but had other risk factors for neonatal jaundice have shown a reduction in need for phototherapy and exchange transfusion by the use of antenatal phenobarbital. A recent retrospective case‐controlled study showed reduction in the need for exchange transfusion for the neonates from isoimmunized pregnancies. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of antenatal phenobarbital in red cell isoimmunized pregnancies in reducing the incidence of phototherapy and exchange transfusion for the neonate. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (June 2009).
Selection criteria
Randomised and quasi‐randomised controlled trials of pregnant women established to have red cell isoimmunization in the current pregnancy during their antenatal testing and given phenobarbital alone or in combination with other drugs before birth. 
Data collection and analysis
All three review authors independently assessed study eligibility and quality.
Main results
No trials met the inclusion criteria for this review.
Authors' conclusions
The use of antenatal phenobarbital to reduce neonatal jaundice in red cell isoimmunized pregnant women has not been evaluated in randomised controlled trials.
