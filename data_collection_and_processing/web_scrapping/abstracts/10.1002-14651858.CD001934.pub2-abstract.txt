Background
This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in The Cochrane Library in Issue 2, 2001 and previously updated in 2007 and 2009. 
Vocal cord nodules are bilateral, benign, callous‐like growths of the mid‐portion of the membranous vocal folds. They are of variable size and are characterised histologically by thickening of the epithelium with a variable degree of inflammation in the underlying superficial lamina propria. They characteristically produce hoarseness, discomfort and an unstable voice when speaking or singing. 
Objectives
To assess the effectiveness of surgery versus non‐surgical interventions for vocal cord nodules. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Ear, Nose and Throat Disorders Group Trials Register; the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); PubMed; EMBASE; CINAHL; Web of Science; BIOSIS Previews; Cambridge Scientific Abstracts; ISRCTN and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. The date of the most recent search was 9 April 2012. 
Selection criteria
Randomised and quasi‐randomised trials comparing any surgical intervention for vocal cord nodules with non‐surgical treatment or no treatment. 
Data collection and analysis
No suitable trials were identified.
Main results
No studies fulfilled the inclusion criteria.
Authors' conclusions
There is a need for high‐quality randomised controlled trials to evaluate the effectiveness of surgical and non‐surgical treatment of vocal cord nodules.
