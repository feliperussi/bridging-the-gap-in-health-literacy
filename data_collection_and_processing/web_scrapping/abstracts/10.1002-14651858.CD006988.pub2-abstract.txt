Background
Differentiated thyroid carcinoma with thyroglobulin positive and radioactive iodine negative metastases has been observed in follow‚Äêup studies. The management of this condition remains controversial. Most studies support blind radioactive iodine treatment while others negate this approach. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of radioiodine therapy for differentiated thyroid carcinoma with thyroglobulin positive and radioactive iodine negative metastases. 
Search methods
Studies were obtained from computerised searches of MEDLINE, EMBASE, The Cochrane Library, China National Infrastructure (CNKI) and paper collections of conferences held in Chinese. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled clinical trials and prospective controlled clinical trials.
Data collection and analysis
Two authors independently extracted data and interviewed authors of all potentially relevant studies by electronic mail to verify randomisation procedures. One author entered data into a data extraction form and the second one verified the results of this procedure. 
Main results
Because of the absence of any suitable randomised or prospective controlled trial in this area, results currently cannot be presented. 
Authors' conclusions
The currently available evidence is insufficient to reliably assess the potential of radioiodine treatment for differentiated thyroid carcinoma with thyroglobulin positive and radioactive iodine negative metastases.
