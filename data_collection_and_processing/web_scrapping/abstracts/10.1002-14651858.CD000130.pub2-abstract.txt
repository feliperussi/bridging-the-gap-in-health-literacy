April 2008
The 'Manual removal of placenta at caesarean section' review was withdrawn from the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews 2006, Issue 3 because it was out of date. This review has now been updated and replaced by a new review entitled 'Methods of delivering the placenta at caesarean section', first published in the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews 2008, Issue 3.
