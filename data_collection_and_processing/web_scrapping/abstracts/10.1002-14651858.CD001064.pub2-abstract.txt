Background
Piracetam is thought to promote the metabolism of brain cells when they are hypoxic. It has been used to prevent adverse effects of fetal distress. 
Objectives
The objective of this review was to assess the effects of piracetam for suspected fetal distress in labour on method of delivery and perinatal morbidity. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (15 February 2012). 
Selection criteria
Randomised trials of piracetam compared with placebo or no treatment for suspected fetal distress in labour. 
Data collection and analysis
Both review authors assessed eligibility and trial quality.
Main results
One study of 96 women was included. Piracetam compared with placebo was associated with a trend to reduced need for caesarean section (risk ratio 0.57, 95% confidence interval 0.32 to 1.03). There were no statistically significant differences between the piracetam and placebo group for neonatal morbidity (measured by neonatal respiratory distress) or Apgar score. 
Authors' conclusions
There is not enough evidence to evaluate the use of piracetam for fetal distress in labour.
