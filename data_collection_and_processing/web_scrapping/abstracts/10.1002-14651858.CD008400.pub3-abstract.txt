Background
Mumps is an acute, viral illness transmitted by respiratory droplets and saliva. A number of studies published in China have suggested that acupuncture is beneficial for children with mumps but the literature reporting the benefits or harms of acupuncture for mumps has not been systematically reviewed. 
Objectives
To determine the efficacy and safety of acupuncture for children with mumps.
Search methods
We searched CENTRAL (2014, Issue 11), MEDLINE (1950 to November week 3, 2014), EMBASE (1974 to December 2014), CINAHL (1981 to December 2014), AMED (1985 to December 2014), the Chinese BioMedical Literature Database (CBM) (1979 to November 2014), China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) (1979 to November 2014), Chinese Technology Periodical Database (CTPD) (1989 to November 2014) and Wanfang database (1982 to November 2014). We also handsearched a number of journals (from first issue to current issue). 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials comparing acupuncture with placebo acupuncture, no management, Chinese medication, Western medication or other treatments for mumps. Acupuncture included either traditional acupuncture or contemporary acupuncture, regardless of the source of stimulation (body, electro, scalp, fire, hand, fine needle, moxibustion). 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently extracted data. We identified no trials for inclusion in this updated review. 
Main results
No study met our inclusion criteria.
Authors' conclusions
We could not reach any conclusion about the efficacy and safety of acupuncture as we identified no trials for inclusion in this review. More high‚Äêquality research is needed.
