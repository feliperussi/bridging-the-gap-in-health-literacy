Background
The early institution of enteral feeding in the first few days of life is known to impact on the development of unconjugated hyperbilirubinaemia. However, the effect of early intravenous nutrition on neonatal jaundice remains unknown. 
Objectives
To determine the effect of early intravenous nutrition on neonatal jaundice.
Search methods
The standard search strategy of the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group was used including searches of the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register (Cochrane Library: Issue 3, 2002), MEDLINE (1966‐December 2002), and EMBASE (1974‐December 2002). 
Selection criteria
Randomised or quasi‐randomised controlled trials evaluating the effect of early intravenous nutrition on unconjugated bilirubin. 
Data collection and analysis
The search strategy identified no eligible studies, thus no data were collected.
Main results
No studies were identified.
Authors' conclusions
Decisions regarding the institution of early intravenous nutrition must continue to be based upon factors others than its effect on neonatal jaundice.
