Background
Symptoms of bronchiectasis include chronic productive cough, wheeze, breathlessness and recurrent infections of the lower respiratory tract. Long‐acting bronchodilators are being used more frequently in the management of people with this condition. 
Objectives
To determine the effectiveness of long‐acting bronchodilators in the management of bronchiectasis that is not due to cystic fibrosis. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Airways Group Specialised Register of bronchiectasis trials. The latest searches were carried out in August 2010. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials, with or without masking.
Data collection and analysis
The results of searches were reviewed against pre‐specified criteria.
Main results
We were unable to identify any randomised controlled trials investigating the effectiveness of long‐acting bronchodilator therapy in the management of bronchiectasis. An update search in August 2010 did not identify any new studies. 
Authors' conclusions
Further research is needed to establish if long‐acting bronchodilators have a role in the management of people with bronchiectasis.
