Background
Calcium channel blockers may increase the blood flow to the fetus or may improve fetal‚Äêplacental cellular energy generation. This could enhance fetal growth. 
Objectives
The objectives of this review were to assess the effects of calcium channel blockers on fetal growth and neonatal morbidity and mortality in pregnancies where impaired fetal growth is suspected. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (June 2009).
Selection criteria
Acceptably controlled trials of calcium channel blockers in women with potential impaired fetal growth. 
Data collection and analysis
Eligibility and trial quality were assessed.
Main results
One study of 100 women (all smokers) was included. Mean birthweight was significantly higher in women receiving flunarizine compared to the control group. No other significant differences were found. 
Authors' conclusions
There is not enough evidence to evaluate the use of calcium channel blockers for impaired fetal growth. The apparent beneficial effect of calcium channel blockers on birthweight warrants further investigation.
