Background
Preterm prelabour rupture of membranes (PPROM) before 26 weeks can delay lung development and can cause pulmonary hypoplasia, as a result of oligohydramnios. Restoring the amniotic fluid volume by transabdominal amnioinfusion might prevent abnormal lung development and might have a protective effect for neurological complications, fetal deformities and neonatal sepsis. 
Objectives
To assess the effectiveness of transabdominal amnioinfusion in improving perinatal outcome in women with oligohydramnios secondary to rupture of fetal membranes before 26 weeks. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (30 April 2013). 
Selection criteria
All randomised controlled trials comparing transabdominal amnioinfusion with no transabdominal amnioinfusion. Cluster‐ or quasi‐randomised trials were not eligible for inclusion. In cases where only an abstract was available, we attempted to find the full articles. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors assessed trials for inclusion. No eligible trials were identified.
Main results
There are no included studies.
Authors' conclusions
There is currently no evidence to evaluate the use of transabdominal amnioinfusion in women with oligohydramnios secondary to rupture of fetal membranes before 26 weeks for improving perinatal outcome. Further research examining the effects of this intervention is needed. Two randomised controlled trials are ongoing but final data have not yet been published.
