Background
Peripartum cardiomyopathy (PPCM or PCMO) is a rare disease of unknown etiology, characterised by an acute onset of heart failure in women in the late stage of pregnancy or in the early months postpartum. 
Objectives
To assess the effectiveness and safety of any intervention for the care of women and/or their babies with a diagnosis of peripartum cardiomyopathy. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (27 July 2010) and the reference lists of identified studies. 
Selection criteria
Randomised and quasi‚Äêrandomised controlled trials of any intervention for treating peripartum cardiomyopathy. Such interventions include: drugs; cardiac monitoring and treatment; haemodynamic monitoring and treatments; supportive therapies and heart transplant. 
Data collection and analysis
Two authors independently assessed the studies for inclusion, assessed risk of bias and carried out data extraction. Data entry was checked. 
Main results
We identified and included one pilot study, involving 20 women, undertaken in South Africa. Women were diagnosed postnatally and included in the study within 24 hours of diagnosis. 
Authors' conclusions
There are insufficient data to draw any firm conclusions. Treatment with bromocriptine appears promising, although women would be unable to breastfeed due to suppression of lactation.
