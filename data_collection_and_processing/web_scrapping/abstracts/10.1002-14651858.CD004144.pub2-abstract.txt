Background
Tubal sterilisation is the most popular contraceptive method in the world. Approximately 138 million women of reproductive age have had tubal sterilisation and there is evidence that increasingly younger women are being sterilized. With such large numbers of women choosing this option of birth control, it is clear that even if a small percentage of women later regret the decision, large numbers of women will seek counselling regarding reversal from their physicians. 
Objectives
To compare the efficacy of surgical tubal reanastomosis and in vitro fertilisation in terms of live birth rates. The morbidity and cost‐effectiveness of both techniques were also to be compared. 
Search methods
In a recent update of this review the following databases were searched: Cochrane Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Review Group Specialised Register, MEDLINE (1966 to 2009), EMBASE (1980 to 2009), PsychInfo (1806‐2009) and CENTRAL (2nd quarter 2009). We handsearched the reference lists of trials, reviews and relevant textbooks; searched abstracts from relevant conferences, and personally communicated with experts in the field. 
Selection criteria
Randomised trials comparing surgical reversal of tubal sterilisation with in vitro fertilisation (IVF). 
Data collection and analysis
No RCTs were found that met the selection criteria.
Main results
No data exist on which to report.
Authors' conclusions
There is little likelihood that any future research will be conducted to compare IVF with tubal reanastomosis for subfertility after tubal sterilisation. Therefore this review will not be updated in the future.
