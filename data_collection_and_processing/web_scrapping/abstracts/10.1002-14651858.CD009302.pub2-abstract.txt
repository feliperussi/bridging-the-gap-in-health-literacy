Background
The effectiveness of antenatal magnesium sulphate for neuroprotection of the fetus, infant, and child prior to very preterm birth, when given to women considered at risk of preterm birth, has been established. There is currently no consensus as to the regimen to use in terms of the dose, duration, the use of repeat dosing and timing. 
Objectives
To assess the comparative effectiveness and adverse effects of different magnesium sulphate regimens for neuroprotection of the fetus in women considered at risk of preterm birth. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group’s Trials Register (31 December 2011). 
Selection criteria
Randomised trials comparing different magnesium sulphate regimens when used for neuroprotection of the fetus in women considered at risk of preterm birth. We planned to include cluster trials. We planned to exclude quasi‐randomised trials and those with a crossover design. We planned to include trials published as full‐text papers, along with those published in abstract form only. 
Data collection and analysis
We planned that at least two review authors would assess trial eligibility.
Main results
No eligible completed trials were identified.
Authors' conclusions
Although strong evidence supports the use of antenatal magnesium sulphate for neuroprotection of the fetus prior to very preterm birth, no trials comparing different treatment regimens have been completed. Research should be directed towards comparisons of different dosages and other variations in regimens, evaluating both maternal and infant outcomes.
