Background
Failure of the normal expansion of plasma volume in the mother is associated with impaired fetal growth and pre‐eclampsia. 
Objectives
The objective of this review was to assess the effects of plasma volume expansion for suspected impaired fetal growth. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (March 2010).
Selection criteria
Randomized or quasi‐randomized trials of plasma volume expansion compared to no plasma volume expansion in women with suspected impaired fetal growth. 
Data collection and analysis
Trial quality was assessed.
Main results
No studies were included.
Authors' conclusions
There is not enough evidence to evaluate the use of plasma volume expansion for suspected impaired fetal growth.
