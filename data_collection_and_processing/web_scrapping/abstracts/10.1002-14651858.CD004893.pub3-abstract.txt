Background
Anticonvulsant therapy is sometimes used prophylactically in patients with chronic subdural haematoma, although the benefit is unclear. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of prophylactic anticonvulsants in patients with chronic subdural haematoma, in both the pre‐ and post‐operative periods. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Injuries Group's Specialised Register, CENTRAL (The Cochrane Library), MEDLINE (OvidSP), EMBASE (OvidSP), PubMed, LILACS, and the databases clinicaltrials.gov, the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and Current Controlled Trials. The search was through 27th March 2013. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials comparing any anticonvulsant versus placebo or no intervention.
Data collection and analysis
Three authors screened the search results to identify relevant studies. No studies met the inclusion criteria for the review. 
Main results
No randomised controlled trials were identified.
Authors' conclusions
No formal recommendations can be made about the use of prophylactic anticonvulsants in patients with chronic subdural haematoma based on the literature currently available. There are no randomised controlled trials on this topic, and non‐controlled studies have conflicting results. There is an urgent need for well‐designed randomised controlled trials.
