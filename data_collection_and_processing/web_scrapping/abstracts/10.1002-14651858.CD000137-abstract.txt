Background
Fetal hypoxaemia is often a feature of fetal growth impairment. It has been suggested that perinatal outcome after suspected impaired fetal growth might be improved by giving mothers continuous oxygen until delivery. 
Objectives
The objective was to assess the effects of maternal oxygen therapy in suspected impaired fetal growth on fetal growth and perinatal outcome. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (June 2009).
Selection criteria
Acceptably controlled trials comparing maternal oxygen therapy with no oxygen therapy in suspected impaired fetal growth. 
Data collection and analysis
Eligibility and trial quality was assessed.
Main results
Three studies involving 94 women were included. Oxygenation compared with no oxygenation was associated with a lower perinatal mortality rate (risk ratio 0.50, 95% confidence interval 0.32 to 0.81). However, higher gestational age in the oxygenation groups may have accounted for the difference in mortality rates. 
Authors' conclusions
There is not enough evidence to evaluate the benefits and risks of maternal oxygen therapy for suspected impaired fetal growth. Further trials of maternal hyperoxygenation seem warranted.
