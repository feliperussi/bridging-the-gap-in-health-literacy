Background
Non‐specific cough has been defined as non‐productive cough in the absence of identifiable respiratory disease or known aetiology and is common in childhood. These children are treated with a variety of therapies, including non‐pharmacological treatments. There is a wide variety and a growing market for these non‐pharmacological treatments that include air‐modification modalities. 
Objectives
To determine the efficacy of air‐modification modalities, (ionisers, vaporisers, humidifiers, air filters, regular vacuuming), in treating children with non‐specific cough. 
Search methods
The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, OLDMEDLINE and EMBASE databases were searched by the Cochrane Airways Group. The latest searches were performed in November 2008. 
Selection criteria
All randomised controlled trials comparing air‐modification modalities with a placebo treatment, for any duration. 
Data collection and analysis
Results of searches were reviewed against pre‐determined criteria for inclusion. Five papers were considered for inclusion but no eligible trials were identified and thus no data was available for analysis. 
Main results
No randomised controlled trials that examined the efficacy of air‐modification modalities in the management of prolonged, non‐specific cough in children were found. 
Authors' conclusions
Based on the evidence currently available, a recommendation can not be given for air‐modification interventions in the treatment of prolonged, non‐specific cough in children.
