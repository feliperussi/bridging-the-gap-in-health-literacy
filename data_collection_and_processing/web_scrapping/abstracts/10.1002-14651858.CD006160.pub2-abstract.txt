Background
Anaphylaxis is an acute systemic allergic reaction, which can be life‐threatening. H1‐antihistamines are commonly used as an adjuvant therapy in the treatment of anaphylaxis. 
Objectives
To assess the benefits and harm of H1‐antihistamines in the treatment of anaphylaxis.
Search methods
In our previous version we searched until June 2006. In this version we searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), (The Cochrane Library 2010, Issue 11), MEDLINE (1966 to November 2010); EMBASE (1966 to November 2010); CINAHL (1982 to Nobember 2010) and ISI Web of Science (1945 to November 2010). We also contacted pharmaceutical companies and international experts in anaphylaxis in an attempt to locate unpublished material. 
Selection criteria
We planned to include randomized and quasi‐randomized controlled trials comparing H1‐antihistamines with placebo or no intervention. 
Data collection and analysis
Two authors independently assessed articles for inclusion.
Main results
We found no studies that satisfied the inclusion criteria.
Authors' conclusions
Based on this review, we are unable to make any recommendations for clinical practice. Randomized controlled trials are needed, although these are likely to prove challenging to design and execute.
