Background
Although there have been considerable gains in understanding the cascade of events that lead to secondary injury after traumatic brain injury (TBI), efforts to translate this understanding into new therapeutic, so‐called neuroprotective approaches, have so far proved disappointing. As an alternative, there is growing interest in approaches to enhance brain repair after injury. Animal models suggest that agents enhancing monoaminergic transmission (monoaminergic agonists, or MAs) particularly amphetamines, promote motor recovery from focal brain injury and it is proposed that this might represent a complementary means of therapeutic intervention in the later post‐injury phase. 
Objectives
To evaluate the evidence that MAs improve final outcome after TBI.
Search methods
We searched CENTRAL; MEDLINE; EMBASE; ISI Web of Science: Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI‐EXPANDED) and Conference Proceedings Citation Index‐ Science (CPCI‐S) and www.controlled‐trials.com to March 2009. We contacted authors of known unpublished trials in progress. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials comparing the use of a MA (together with conventional non‐pharmacological rehabilitative therapy) versus conventional non‐pharmacological rehabilitative therapy alone. 
Data collection and analysis
Two authors independently screened records, extracted data and assessed trial quality.
Main results
Although there is limited clinical literature addressing this topic, none of the studies identified fully met inclusion criteria for this review. 
Authors' conclusions
At present there is insufficient evidence to support the routine use of MAs to promote recovery after TBI.
