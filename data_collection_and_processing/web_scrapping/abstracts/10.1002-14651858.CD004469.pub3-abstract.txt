Background
Brain abscess is a focal, intracerebral infection that begins as a localized area of brain infection and develops into a collection of pus surrounded by a well‚Äêvascularized capsule. People with cyanotic congenital heart disease are at risk of developing brain abscess. 
Objectives
To evaluate the effectiveness of antibiotic regimens for treating brain abscess in people with cyanotic congenital heart disease. 
Search methods
We updated the searches of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) on The Cochrane Library Issue 12 of 12, December 2012, MEDLINE Ovid (1946 to December Week 4 2012), EMBASE Ovid (1980 to 2013 Week 01) and LILACS (1980 to 9 January 2013) on 9 January 2013. No language or publication restrictions were applied. 
Selection criteria
Randomized controlled trials that reported clinically meaningful outcomes and presented results on an intention to treat basis, irrespective of blinding, publication status, or language. 
Data collection and analysis
Data were to be extracted, unblinded, by the two reviewers independently.
Main results
No studies meeting the inclusion criteria were identified.
Authors' conclusions
There are no randomized controlled trials about the effectiveness of antibiotic regimens for treating people with cyanotic congenital heart disease who developed a brain abscess. Currently, the antibiotic regimens used are based on previous retrospective studies and clinical experience. There is a need for a well designed multicentre randomized controlled trial to evaluate the effects of different antibiotic regimens.
