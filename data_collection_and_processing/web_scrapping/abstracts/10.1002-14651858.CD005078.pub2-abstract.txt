Background
Fractures of the odontoid process of the second cervical vertebra can result in instability, neurological damage and death. Treatment includes conservative management (external immobilisation devices) or surgical treatment (internal fixation by posterior fusion or anterior screw fixation). 
Objectives
To compare surgical with conservative treatment for fractures of the odontoid process.
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Bone, Joint and Muscle Trauma Group Specialised Register (September 2010), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library 2010, Issue 3), MEDLINE (1950 to August Week 5 2010), EMBASE (1980 to 2010 Week 35), LILACS (September 2010), reference lists of articles and registries of ongoing trials. 
Selection criteria
Randomised and quasi‚Äêrandomised controlled trials comparing surgical versus conservative treatment of odontoid fractures. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently examined the search results to identify trials for inclusion. 
Main results
We identified an interm report of one study which appeared to meet our inclusion criteria but are awaiting further details from the trial authors before making a final judgment. We excluded one registered study comparing surgery and conservative treatment which does not involve randomisation of treatment allocation. 
Authors' conclusions
There is no evidence available from adequately controlled trials to inform the decision on whether the surgical treatment of odontoid fractures gives a better outcome. A sufficiently powered good quality multicentre randomised controlled trial comparing surgery versus conservative treatment is warranted.
