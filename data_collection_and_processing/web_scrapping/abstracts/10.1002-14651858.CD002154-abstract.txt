Background
Two recent epidemiological studies have reported that children using non‐feather pillows suffered from more frequent episodes of wheeze than those using feather pillows 
Objectives
To evaluate the efficacy of using feather bedding in the control of asthma symptoms.
Search methods
The Cochrane Airways Group Specialised Register was searched with pre‐specified terms. Seaches are current to February 2009. 
Selection criteria
Only randomised or controlled clinical trials were to be included.
Data collection and analysis
No trials met the inclusion criteria for the review.
Main results
From electronic literature searches a total of 15 studies have been retrieved for scrutiny as full‐text papers. However, on review none of them have met the review entry criteria. 
Authors' conclusions
Whilst recent epidemiological studies suggest that feather bedding is associated with less frequent wheeze than man‐made fibre fillings, the evidence currently available is insufficient to assess the clinical benefits of feather bedding in the management of asthma.
