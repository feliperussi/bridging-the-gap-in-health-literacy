Background
The morbidity caused by postnatal depression is enormous. Several psychological or psychosocial interventions have appeared to be effective for treating the disorder although they have not shown a clear benefit in preventing the development of PND. As yet however, the effectiveness of hypnosis has not been evaluated in relation to this. 
Objectives
To assess the effect of hypnosis for preventing postnatal depression compared with usual antenatal, intranatal, or postnatal care. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (30 September 2011). 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials comparing hypnosis with usual antenatal, intranatal, or postnatal care, where the primary or secondary objective is to assess whether there is a reduced risk of developing postnatal depression. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion and assessed the one included study for risk of bias. The included study did not contribute any data for analysis. 
Main results
There was one included study (involving 63 women). However, as it did not include the outcomes of interest, no data were available for analysis for this review. 
Authors' conclusions
There was no evidence available from randomised controlled trials to assess the effectiveness of hypnosis during pregnancy, childbirth, and the postnatal period for preventing postnatal depression. Evidence from randomised controlled trials is needed to evaluate the use and effects of hypnosis during the perinatal period to prevent postnatal depression. Two trials are currently underway which may provide further information in the future.
