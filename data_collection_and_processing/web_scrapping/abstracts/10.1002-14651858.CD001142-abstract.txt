Background
Constipation is a common problem in late pregnancy. Circulating progesterone may be the cause of slower gastrointestinal movement in mid and late pregnancy. 
Objectives
The objective of this review was to assess the effects of different methods for treating constipation in pregnancy. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group trials register, the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register and MEDLINE. Date of last search: January 2001. 
Selection criteria
Randomised trials of any treatment for constipation in pregnancy.
Data collection and analysis
Trial quality assessments and data extraction were done independently by two reviewers.
Main results
Two suitable trials were identified. Fibre supplements increased the frequency of defecation (odds ratio 0.18, 95% confidence interval 0.05 to 0.67), and lead to softer stools. Stimulant laxatives are more effective than bulk‚Äêforming laxatives (odds ratio 0.30, 95% confidence interval 0.14 to 0.61), but may cause more side effects. 
Authors' conclusions
Dietary supplements of fibre in the form of bran or wheat fibre are likely to help women experiencing constipation in pregnancy. If the problem fails to resolve, stimulant laxatives are likely to prove more effective.
