Urinary catheter policies for long‚Äêterm bladder drainage
Some people use catheters to help them manage their bladder problems (such as leaking urine or not being able to pass urine). Catheters may be permanent urethral catheters (in the tube draining the bladder), suprapubic catheters (via the abdomen) or intermittent catheters (when a catheter is inserted via the urethra several times a day). No trials were found comparing these different methods with each other. Sometimes people using the catheters develop urinary tract infections. There was some weak evidence that using antibiotics all the time reduced the chance of having a urinary tract infection while using intermittent catheters, but there was not enough information about side effects.
