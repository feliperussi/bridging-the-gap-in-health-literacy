Maternal glucose administration for facilitating tests of fetal wellbeing
There is no evidence that antenatal maternal glucose administration make tests of fetal wellbeing more effective. 
Tests on unborn babies such as ultrasound and heart rate testing are carried out to check their wellbeing. As a baby's sleep periods can alter those results, various methods are used to wake the baby. Antenatal maternal glucose administration is one of the methods. The review of two trials, involving 708 participants, did not find this method to be effective. Research on antenatal maternal glucose administration should take into consideration that there have not been any benefits demonstrated as yet.
