Interventions for the prevention and management of vaginal thrush in HIV positive women 
Vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC) / thrush is one of the most common fungal infections and recurs frequently in women with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Even though rarely or never resulting in systemic fungal infection or mortality, interventions for prevention and treatment of this condition is an essential part of maintaining the quality of life of such individuals.This review was aimed at evaluating such interventions. 
The treatment aspect could not be evaluated as our search yielded no trials.
The search yielded two studies dealing with the preventive aspect of the condition. The first trial found weekly fluconazole significantly effective in preventing clinical episodes from occurring as compared to placebo. However,this regimen lead to emergence of species resistant to azoles. 
The second trial with three arms of comparison; Clotrimazole, Lactobacillus and placebo gave no definitive results in preventing an episode of VVC. 
Neither of the included studies investigated the effects of HAART(Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy) or any other form of antiretroviral treatment on VVC nor did they explore difference in quality of life, viral shedding in vaginal secretions (infectivity) ,patient preference for route of administration or the cost.
