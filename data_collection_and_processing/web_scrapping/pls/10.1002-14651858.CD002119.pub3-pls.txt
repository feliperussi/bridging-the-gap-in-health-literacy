Spinal manipulation for painful periods
Painful menstrual periods (dysmenorrhoea) are caused by cramps in the uterus (womb). One of the non‚Äêdrug options for dysmenorrhoea is spinal manipulation (using the hands to put pressure on certain parts of the back bone). This procedure is sometimes offered by physiotherapists, osteopaths or chiropractors. As dysmenorrhoea may be caused by restricted blood flow, manipulating the lower spine could improve blood flow to the pelvic area. The review of trials found no evidence that spinal manipulation relieves dysmenorrhoea.
