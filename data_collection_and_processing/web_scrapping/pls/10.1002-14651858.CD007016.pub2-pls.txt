Tidal versus other forms of peritoneal dialysis for patients with acute kidney injury
Acute kidney injury (AKI) is characterised by a sudden decline in kidney filtration and patients with AKI have reduced (or no) urine output. AKI is clinically defined by an increase in serum creatinine and decrease in glomerular filtration rate. People with AKI need renal replacement therapy usually in the form of kidney dialysis. At present, there is no universally accepted form of dialysis for most AKI patients. Peritoneal dialysis (PD) has been favoured because it causes fewer heart and lung problems, and patients do not need anti‚Äêclotting drugs. Tidal PD (TPD) is an automated process that fills and drains the dialysis fluid, but retains a designated proportion so the peritoneum never completely empties. 
We looked for evidence from randomised controlled trials that investigated TPD versus other forms of dialysis for people with AKI. Only one study of enrolling 87 participants was found that compared TPD with continuous equilibrating PD (CEPD). This study showed that TPD produced higher solute clearances in less time with greater protein loss than CEPD, but did not report how well patients recovered kidney function, nor if any people died. 
There was insufficient evidence to determine if TPD is better or worse than other types of PD for patients with AKI.
