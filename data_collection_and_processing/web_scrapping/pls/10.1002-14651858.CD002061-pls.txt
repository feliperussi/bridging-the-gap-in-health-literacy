Permissive hypercapnia for the prevention of morbidity and mortality in mechanically ventilated newborn infants 
Not enough evidence to show the effect of permissive hypercapnia compared to routine ventilation for preterm babies needing mechanical ventilation. Sometimes preterm babies need help from a machine to breathe (mechanical ventilation). Very low carbon dioxide levels, produced by mechanical ventilation of the lungs are thought to cause lung damage and developmental problems. Hypercapnia (increasing the levels of carbon dioxide in the blood) is used for adults in critical care. It may also help newborn babies, especially those with lung damage on mechanical ventilation. The review of trials found there was not enough evidence to show the effect of permissive hypercania compared to routine ventilation for preterm babies. More research is needed.
