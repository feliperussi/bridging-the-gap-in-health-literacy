Can community interventions deter young people from starting to smoke?
Some evidence is available to suggest that multi‐component community interventions are effective in influencing smoking behaviour and preventing the uptake of smoking in young people. These interventions use co‐ordinated, widespread, multi‐component programmes to try and influence young people's behaviour. Community members are often involved in determining and/or implementing these programmes. These include education of tobacco retailers about age restrictions, programmes for prevention of smoking‐related diseases, mass media, school and family‐based programmes. Changes in intentions to smoke, knowledge, attitudes and perceptions about smoking did not generally appear to affect the long‐term success of the programmes.
