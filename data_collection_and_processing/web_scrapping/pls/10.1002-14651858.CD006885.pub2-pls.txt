Intravesical Bacillus Calmette‐Guérin versus epirubicin for Ta and T1 bladder cancer
Transurethral resection (TUR) is the usual treatment method for patients who, when examined with a cystoscope, are found to have abnormal growths on the urothelium (stage Ta) and/or in the lamina propria (stage T1). However post‐operation tumour recurrence is a major clinical problem. Intravesical Bacillus Calmette‐Guérin or epirubicin following surgery are therefore often used to try to prevent the cancer recurrence. This review found that intravesical Bacillus Calmette‐Guérin is more efficacious than epirubicin to prevent cancer recurrence. However, Bacillus Calmette‐Guérin appears to induce greater local and systemic adverse effects than epirubicin.
