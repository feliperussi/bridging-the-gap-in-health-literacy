Surgical versus non‐surgical interventions for treating humeral shaft fractures in adults 
The humerus is the long bone of the upper arm. It extends from the shoulder to the elbow. The incidence of fractures of the middle part (shaft) of the humerus increases with age. Patients with this fracture can often be treated without surgery. Only a few patients need surgery. This review aimed to examine the evidence from best quality (randomised controlled) trials that compared surgical with non‐surgical treatment of humeral fractures to determine if either treatment gives a better outcome. Despite an extensive search for evidence, the review authors found no evidence from completed randomised controlled trials to help inform the choice between surgical and non‐surgical treatment.
