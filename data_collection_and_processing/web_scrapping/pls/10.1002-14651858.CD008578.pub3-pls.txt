Chinese medicinal herbs for mumps
Review question  We reviewed the evidence about the effect and safety of Chinese medicinal herbs for mumps. 
Background  Mumps (epidemic parotitis) is an infectious illness caused by the multiplication of the mumps virus in the upper respiratory tract. It can range from a mild upper respiratory disease to serious complications. Herbal medicines have been used in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) as the main therapy to prevent and treat mumps for thousands of years. Many Chinese physicians believe that Chinese medicinal herbs are effective in treating mumps. 
Study characteristics  The evidence is current to February 2015. The review authors did not find any randomised controlled trials (RCTs) to provide reliable evidence for the effectiveness and safety of Chinese medicinal herbs for mumps. Although no trials were included, we reviewed the studies and found no reports of adverse events with Chinese medicinal herbs as a treatment for mumps. 
Key results  High‚Äêquality trials are needed to answer these questions.
