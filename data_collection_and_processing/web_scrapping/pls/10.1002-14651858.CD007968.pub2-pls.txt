Acupuncture for newborn babies with hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy (HIE)
Hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) occurs in newborn infants when they lack oxygen in the peripartum period. HIE causes significant morbidity and mortality. Effective treatment options are limited. Acupuncture has been tried. We attempted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of acupuncture for HIE through a systematic review of randomized controlled trials (RCTs). However, no RCT was identified in a systematic and comprehensive search of the medical literature. Good evidence regarding the use of acupuncture for neonates with HIE is lacking currently. The safety of acupuncture for HIE in neonates is unknown. High quality RCTs are needed.
