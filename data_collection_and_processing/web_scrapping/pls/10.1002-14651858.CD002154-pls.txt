Feather versus non‐feather bedding for asthma
An allergen is the substance that causes an allergic reaction in someone who is hypersensitive to it. A major allergen for asthma is the house dust mite. It is thought that artificial (man‐made) fibre fillings for pillows and bedding are less likely to gather allergens than feather‐filled pillows and quilts. However, there is some evidence that in fact, feather bedding may in fact be less likely to cause asthma. The review found no trials comparing feathers with man‐made fibres, and research is needed to be certain which is better for people with asthma.
