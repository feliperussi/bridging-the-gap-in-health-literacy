Propofol use for sedation in newborn babies undergoing procedures
Procedures performed in preterm and term neonates can be stressful and at times painful. Medications to reduce stress/pain for babies can lead to side effects. Propofol is a commonly used medication in adults and children to achieve sedation during minor procedures or major operations. Its use in newborn babies is studied in only one study of 63 babies. Propofol helped to reduce time to complete procedure, time of recovery and time to prepare drugs. However, with this small number of newborns studied, the safety can not be proven. Further studies are warranted.
