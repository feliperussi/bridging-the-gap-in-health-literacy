Neuromuscular paralysis for newborn infants receiving mechanical ventilation
Long‚Äêterm effects of muscle paralysing drugs on newborns needing mechanical ventilation are as yet unclear. 
When newborn infants develop breathing difficulties, they need mechanical ventilation to help them breathe. Sometimes they do not breathe in rhythm with the ventilator but 'fight' the ventilator, causing bleeding in the brain or serious lung injuries. Treating distress or pain caused by the ventilator and adjusting the ventilator to the infant's own breathing pattern can help. Paralysing newborn infants with muscle relaxing drugs such as pancuronium also stops them fighting the ventilator. However, the review of trials found that, although there seems to be some advantage regarding bleeding in the brain, long term effects of this method are not clear. More research is needed.
