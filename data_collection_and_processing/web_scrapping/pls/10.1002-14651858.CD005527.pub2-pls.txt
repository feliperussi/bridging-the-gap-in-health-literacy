Treatment of patients infected with hepatitis C virus
Globally, about 170 million people are chronically infected with hepatitis C virus. Hepatitis C is a blood‐borne virus and routes of transmission include intravenous drug use, mother‐to‐infant transmission, unsafe medical practices, high‐risk sexual behaviour, and blood transfusion. Chronic hepatitis C is in most patients a benign viral infection, but a minority of patients develop liver cirrhosis and may suffer from complications due to cirrhosis or die from it. 
Treatment with interferon clears hepatitis C virus from the blood in about 15% of the patients. Adding ribavirin to interferon (combination therapy) significantly improves the number that clears hepatitis C from the blood to about 40%. Not all patients are tolerant to interferon, and also interferon is costly. This is why ribavirin given as a single drug may be considered as an option for patients with chronic hepatitis C. This review identified 11 randomised trials comparing ribavirin with no antiviral treatment in patient with chronic hepatitis C. Combining the results from all identified trials ribavirin alone seemed without beneficial effects for patients with chronic hepatitis C. Moreover, ribavirin given alone was significantly inferior compared with interferon regarding clearing hepatitis C from the blood and regarding reducing liver enzymes activity in the blood. Furthermore, ribavirin given alone increased the risk of anaemia. Thus, ribavirin given alone cannot be recommended, but more trials may be needed.
