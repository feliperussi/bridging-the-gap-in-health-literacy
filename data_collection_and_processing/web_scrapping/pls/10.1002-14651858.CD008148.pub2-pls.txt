Corticosteroids for HELLP syndrome in pregnancy
Pre‐eclampsia is a serious complication of pregnancy characterized by high blood pressure with protein in the urine and sometimes progression to seizures (fits). HELLP syndrome is a more severe form of pre‐eclampsia which can cause problems with liver function, blood clotting, and low platelets. HELLP may be diagnosed during pregnancy or after giving birth and is associated with ill health for the mother including liver hematoma, rupture, or failure; pulmonary edema; renal failure and death. Infant health may also be poor, primarily due to premature birth and growth restriction.This review examined the effect of treating women with HELLP syndrome using corticosteroids (which can reduce inflammation). The results of this review did not indicate that there was a clear effect on the health of pregnant women when treated with corticosteroids, or their babies. Corticosteroids did appear to improve some components of the women's blood tests, but it is not clear that this had an effect on their overall health. The review identified 11 randomized controlled trials involving 550 women that compared corticosteroid (dexamethasone, betamethasone, or prednisolone) given during pregnancy, just after delivery or in the postnatal period, or both before and after birth, with placebo or no treatment. Two further trials showed that there was no clear difference between dexamethasone and betamethasone on the substantive clinical outcomes for women or their infants. Dexamethasone did improve maternal platelet count and some biochemical measures to a greater extent than betamethasone.
