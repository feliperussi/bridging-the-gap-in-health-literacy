Oral potassium supplementation for high blood pressure in adults
This review examines whether taking potassium supplements can be recommended for treating adults with high blood pressure from no known cause. The results of the trials varied a lot: some trials found potassium lowered blood pressure much more than a dummy drug (placebo), while others found little difference between potassium and placebo. Overall no significant reduction in blood pressure from taking potassium supplements was found. 
Most included trials were of poor quality, so their results may not be reliable. The trials were not long enough or large enough to measure whether potassium supplements reduce the risk of death, heart attack or stroke, which may be caused by high blood pressure. The studies reporting adverse effects did not find any serious side effects from taking potassium supplements. 
This review does not confirm whether potassium supplements can lower high blood pressure and therefore does not recommend them for treating hypertension. More trials enrolling a large number of participants with long periods of follow‚Äêup are necessary to know whether or not potassium supplements can lower high blood pressure.
