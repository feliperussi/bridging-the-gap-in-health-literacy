Use of Gingko biloba, an extract from the leaves of the maidenhair tree, for slowing the progression of age‐related macular degeneration 
Age‐related macular degeneration (AMD) is a condition affecting the central area of the retina (the back of the eye). The retina can deteriorate with age and some people get lesions that lead to loss of central vision. Gingko biloba, extracted from the leaves of the maidenhair tree, is used in Chinese herbal medicine to treat a variety of medical conditions, in particular circulatory problems. Ginkgo biloba extract contains two constituents (flavonoids and terpenoids) which have antioxidant properties. It is believed these may help to slow down the progression of AMD. The author identified two small randomised controlled studies (with a total of 119 participants); one in France and one in Germany. One trial compared Gingko biloba to placebo and the other compared two different doses of the extract. Although both trials reported some positive effects of Ginkgo biloba on vision, the trials were small and of short duration. Adverse effects and quality of life were not assessed. The overall conclusion of this review is that current research has not answered the question as to whether Ginkgo biloba is of benefit to people with AMD. Future trials need to include a larger number of participants and be conducted over a longer time.
