Hepatitis B virus vaccine for People Living With HIV/AIDS
Study Question 
This review seeks to determine whether vaccine for hepatitis B virus is effective in protecting people who have HIV against hepatitis B virus infection. It also seeks to determine if the vaccine is safe in people living with HIV. 
Background 
Hepatitis B virus infection can be acquired through contact with body fluids of infected people. Hepatitis B virus infection manifests with fever, yellowness of the eyes, abdominal pain and fatigue, but it can also be without symptoms especially in long standing infections. It can cause a persisting infection which can lead to liver complications and death. Hepatitis B virus infection and HIV infection are common in poorer countries and in these countries vaccines are not readily available. People living with HIV may not respond well to hepatitis B virus infection because of the weak ability for their bodies to develop resistance. 
Study Characteristics 
Our search for eligible papers was updated in August 2014 and we found one trial with 26 adult participants in Spain. The study sought to test if hepatitis B virus vaccine was better than placebo in preventing PLHIV from getting hepatitis B. 
Key Results 
The single study in this review showed improved immunity against hepatitis B among people living with HIV and taking antiretroviral therapy at 12 months. This immunity was lost once they stopped taking antiretroviral therapy. No side‚Äêeffects were reported. 
Quality of Evidence 
The quality of evidence was assessed as very low.
