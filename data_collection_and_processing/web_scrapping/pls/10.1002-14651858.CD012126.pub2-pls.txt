C‐reactive protein for diagnosing infection in newborn infants
Review question 
We reviewed studies that assessed whether measuring the blood level of C‐reactive protein (CRP) helped to make an earlier diagnosis of serious infections in newborn infants. 
Background 
Newborn infants, especially sick or preterm infants, are at risk of developing severe infections (such as bloodstream infections) during their stay on neonatal units. Infections are often difficult to diagnose early with certainty, and quick tests such as measuring the blood level of a protein that responds to infection (called CRP) are sometimes used to help make an earlier diagnosis. We aimed to assess the evidence for the accuracy of this test. 
Study characteristics 
We found 20 studies that assessed the accuracy of measuring the blood level of CRP to diagnose infections in newborn infants. These studies were similar enough to justify a combined analysis of their findings. 
Key results 
The combined analysis indicated that a positive CRP test correctly identified infants with infection about six times out of 10. 
Conclusion 
Measuring the blood level of CRP is not sufficiently accurate to help early diagnosis of infection in newborn infants.
