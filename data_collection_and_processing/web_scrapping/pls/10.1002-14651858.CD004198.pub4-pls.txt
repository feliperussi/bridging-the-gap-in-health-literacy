Treatments for long‐lasting and painful erection of the penis in boys and men with sickle cell disease 
Review question 
What are the benefits and risks of different treatments for stuttering (repeated short episodes) and fulminant (lasting for six hours or more) priapism in sickle cell disease? 
Background 
Priapism (the prolonged painful erection of the penis) is common in males with sickle cell disease. The length of time priapism lasts differs for different types and so does the medical treatment for it. Self‐management approaches may be helpful. We looked for randomised controlled trials of different treatments to find the best option. 
Search date 
We last looked for evidence on 09 September 2019.
Study characteristics 
We found three trials set in Jamaica, Nigeria and the UK involving 102 people.
Key results 
In the trials, four different drug treatments (stilboestrol, sildenafil, ephedrine and etilefrine) were compared to placebo. The trials all looked at whether the treatments reduced how often attacks of priapism occurred. There was no difference between any of the treatments compared to placebo. Due to lack of high‐quality evidence, we are not able to conclude the best treatment of priapism in sickle cell disease. More research is needed. This is an update of a previously published review. 
Quality of the evidence 
We considered the quality of evidence to be low to very low as all of the trials were at risk of bias and all had low participant numbers.
