Re‐feeding versus discarding gastric residuals to improve growth in preterm infants
Review question 
Does re‐feeding stomach aspirates in preterm infants promote growth without causing feeding problems? 
Background 
Monitoring of stomach aspirates to diagnose feed intolerance and necrotising enterocolitis is a common practice for preterm infants on tube feeds. There is no consensus on whether to re‐feed or discard the stomach aspirates. Although re‐feeding the aspirates may replace partially digested milk and gastrointestinal secretions that are essential for gastrointestinal maturation, re‐feeding abnormal aspirates may result in vomiting, necrotising enterocolitis, or sepsis. We have looked for evidence from clinical trials that assessed whether re‐feeding stomach aspirates is beneficial or harmful in preterm infants. 
Study characteristics 
The thorough literature search is up‐to‐date as of Febraury 2018. We found only one small randomised controlled trial (with 72 preterm infant participants) that addressed this question. 
Key results 
We are uncertain as to whether re‐feeding stomach aspirates has an effect on important outcomes such as incidence of necrotising enterocolitis, mortality before discharge, time to regain birth weight, time to reach full enteral feeds, duration of parenteral nutrition and duration of hospital stay. 
Quality of evidence 
Available evidence is insufficient to support or refute re‐feeding of stomach aspirates in preterm infants. More trials are needed to examine whether re‐feeding the stomach aspirates is beneficial or harmful in preterm infants.
