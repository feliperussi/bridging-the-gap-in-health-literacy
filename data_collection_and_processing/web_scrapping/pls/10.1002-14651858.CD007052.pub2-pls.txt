No evidence from randomised clinical trials for optimal treatment for gallbladder polyp 
The management of gallbladder polyp is controversial. Removal of the gallbladder (cholecystectomy) for gallbladder polyps larger than 10 mm has been recommended because of the association between polyps larger than 10 mm and gallbladder cancer. Cholecystectomy is often recommended for patients with biliary type pain and polyps smaller than 10 mm. There has been no randomised clinical trial comparing cholecystectomy with observation for gallbladder polyps. Randomised clinical trials with low bias‚Äêrisk (low likelihood of systematic error) are necessary to evaluate the role of cholecystectomy in gallbladder polyps smaller than 10 mm.
