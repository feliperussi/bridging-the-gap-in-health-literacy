Spinal versus epidural anaesthesia for caesarean section
Effective regional anaesthesia for caesarean section can be achieved by both spinal or epidural techniques. 
Compared to epidural, spinal anaesthesia allows surgery to begin earlier, but increases the need to treat hypotension. There was no difference shown with respect to failure rate, need for additional intraoperative analgesia, conversion to general anaesthesia intraoperatively, maternal satisfaction, and neonatal intervention. Differences in side‚Äêeffects such as post dural puncture headache, nausea and vomiting, and postoperative complications needing anaesthetic intervention were inconclusive due to the small numbers reported. No studies reported breastfeeding ability and time to ambulation post surgery.
