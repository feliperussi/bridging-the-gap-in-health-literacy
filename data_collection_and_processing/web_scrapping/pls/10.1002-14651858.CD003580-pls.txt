Heparin for pregnant women with acquired or inherited thrombophilias
No evidence from trials on the effects of heparin on pregnancy outcomes for women with a thrombophilia. 
Thrombophilias are a group of disorders where the person's blood is prone to thrombosis (clotting). These blood clots can cause life‐threatening complications such as DVT (deep vein thrombosis). Thrombophilia can cause a number of serious complications in pregnancy, such as growth restriction, stillbirth and severe pre‐eclampsia. Heparin is an anti‐clotting drug which thins the blood. It does not seem to have adverse effects on the baby during pregnancy, and few adverse effects on the pregnant woman. However, the review found no trials on the effects of heparin on pregnancy outcomes for women with a thrombophilia.
