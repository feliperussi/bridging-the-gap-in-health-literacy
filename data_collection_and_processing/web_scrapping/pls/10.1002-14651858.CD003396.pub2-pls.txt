Fetal manipulation for facilitating tests of fetal wellbeing
There is some evidence that manual fetal manipulation of unborn babies make tests of their wellbeing more effective. 
Tests on unborn babies such as ultrasound and heart rate testing are carried out to check their wellbeing. As a baby's sleep periods can alter those results, various methods are used to wake the baby. Manual fetal manipulation is one of the methods. The review of trials suggests that this method could improve the efficiency of antepartum fetal heart rate testing. Research on manual fetal manipulation should take into consideration the different stimulation protocols.
