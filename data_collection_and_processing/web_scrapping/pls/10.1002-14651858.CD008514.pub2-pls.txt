Intratympanic steroids for Ménière's disease or syndrome
Ménière's disease is a disorder of the inner ear which results in a spinning form of dizziness (vertigo), hearing loss and ringing in the ear (tinnitus); this can be very disabling. The cause of Ménière's disease is unknown. There has been some support in the medical literature for a course of treatment that involves the injection of steroids through the eardrum and into the middle ear to reduce the frequency and severity of these symptoms. 
We looked for studies which compared steroid injections in the ear with placebo in patients with Ménière's disease or syndrome. Only one study satisfied the prespecified inclusion criteria for this review. This study demonstrated a benefit of this treatment for patients with Ménière's disease; at 24 months the patients in the treatment group had far fewer episodes of vertigo. The results of this review are encouraging, however as it is based solely on the results of a single study, further research is required.
