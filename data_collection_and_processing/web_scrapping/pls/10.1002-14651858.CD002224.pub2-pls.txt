There is insufficient evidence that radiotherapy works as well as surgery for treating groin nodes in early vulvar cancer. 
Cancer of the vulva is mainly a disease of elderly women. Surgery involves removal of the tumour and surrounding lymph nodes, occasionally followed by radiotherapy. Although survival rates are high if the tumour is found early enough, removal of the lymph nodes causes odema (swelling), particularly in the legs. Wound healing and psychosexual problems are also common. While radiotherapy may be effective in the short term, there is not enough evidence from trials to show that it is as effective as surgery in preventing tumour regrowth in the lymph nodes of the groin.
