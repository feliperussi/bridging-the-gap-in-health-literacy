Trypanocidal drugs for late‐stage, symptomatic Chagas disease
Review question 
Is trypanocidal drug treatment effective for late‐stage, symptomatic Chagas disease and chronic chagasic cardiomyopathy (CCC)? 
Background 
Infection with the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi causes American trypanosomiasis, or Chagas disease. The evidence shows that trypanocidal drug treatment, using nitrofuran and imidazole compounds, can cure acute trypanosomiasis cruzi infections. However, it is unclear whether these treatments are effective for late‐stage, symptomatic Chagas disease and CCC. 
Study characteristics 
We searched the medical literature for randomised double‐blind controlled clinical trials with or without placebo (dummy treatment) to November 2019. Randomised controlled trials are studies in which participants are assigned to one of two or more treatment groups using a random method. In a double‐blind study, neither the participants nor the researchers know who is receiving a particular treatment. 
Key results 
We found two trials that looked at treatment of chronic Typanosoma cruzi infection (late‐stage, symptomatic Chagas disease and CCC) with the trypanocidal drugs benznidazole and nifurtimox. After reviewing this limited evidence, we concluded that it is insufficient to support treatment with these drugs. 
Certainty of the evidence 
The certainty of the evidence ranges between low to very low since a small number of trials were included and the number of participants was limited. More clinical trials are therefore required to evaluate the effect and efficacy of trypanocidal drugs in late‐stage, symptomatic Chagas disease and CCC.
