Heparin for treatment of the neonate with thrombosis (blood clot formation)
Review question: In newborn infants with evidence of thrombosis (blood clot formation), does administration of heparin improve survival and other important outcomes? 
Background: Among pediatric patients, newborns are at highest risk of thrombosis owing to differences in the neonatal hemostatic system (the system that helps bleeding to stop). Abnormal blood clot formation might start in an artery (blood going away from the heart) or in a vein (blood going toward the heart). Different management strategies have been described, ranging from "wait and see" to active management aimed at dissolving clots (fibrinolytic) and preventing clot formation (anticoagulant). Possible side effects of active management include secondary bleeding. However, in some cases, thrombosis can be a life‚Äêthreatening event requiring active management. Despite limited evidence on anticoagulant treatment in neonates, heparin has become a standard therapy. Current recommendations and dosing regimens for anticoagulative treatment are based on uncontrolled studies and have been adapted from data derived from reports on adult and pediatric patients. The evidence is current to May 2016. 
Study characteristics and results: We included no studies in this review, and we identified no ongoing studies.
