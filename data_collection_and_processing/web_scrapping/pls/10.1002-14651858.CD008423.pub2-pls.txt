Screening for nasopharyngeal cancer
Review question 
Does screening individuals without symptoms using an Epstein‐Barr virus blood test or nasopharyngoscopy (or both) reduce the mortality associated with nasopharyngeal cancer? 
Background 
Nasopharyngeal cancer is a rare cancer worldwide, but it is common in the Cantonese population of southern China. Due to its deep location in the nose and non‐specific initial symptoms nasopharyngeal cancer is often detected late. While the prognosis for advanced nasopharyngeal cancer is very poor, early‐stage nasopharyngeal cancer is potentially curable. Therefore early identification by screening might lead to improved outcomes. There are two common screening tests: the Epstein‐Barr virus (EBV) blood test and nasopharyngoscopy (a procedure that allows the internal surfaces of the nose and throat to be examined with a fibre‐optic instrument). Studying the benefits of screening for nasopharyngeal cancer started in the 1970s, but the value of this approach remains uncertain. 
Study characteristics 
This review intended to investigate the efficacy of a programme of screening and treatment using the EBV test and nasopharyngoscopy as a screening test for nasopharyngeal cancer. However, we did not identify any randomised or controlled clinical trials evaluating such a strategy. 
Key results 
There is a need for high‐quality studies to determine the effectiveness of a screening programme for nasopharyngeal cancer, especially studies that assess long‐term outcomes, such as mortality, and cost‐effectiveness. 
Quality of the evidence 
This review is up to date to July 2015.
