Currently there is no evidence available from randomised control trials to determine whether Single Incision Laparoscopic Surgery provides any better effect than Conventional Multi‐incision Laparoscopic Surgery for appendicectomy. 
Laparoscopic appendicectomy is used in treating appendicitis and can be achieved using several skin incisions in the abdominal wall, or more recently with a single skin incision through which instruments are introduced into the peritoneal cavity. Since no randomised control trials of single incision versus conventional multi‐incision laparoscopic surgery for appendicectomy could be found, the efficacy and safety of the two approaches could not be analysed in this review. There is a need for randomised control trials of single incision laparoscopic appendicectomy for appendicitis.
