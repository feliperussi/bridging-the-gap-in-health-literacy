No clear evidence to show any one optimal surgical technique is superior for treating pre‐cancerous cervix abnormalities 
Cervical pre‐cancer (cervical intraepithelial neoplasia) can be treated in different ways depending on the extent and nature of the disease. Less invasive treatments that do not require a hospital stay may be used. A general anaesthetic is occasionally needed, especially if the disease has spread locally, early invasion is suspected or previous out‐patient treatment has failed. Surgery can be done with a knife, cryotherapy (freezing the abnormal cells), laser or cutting with a loop (an electrically charged wire). This review found there was not enough evidence to confidently select the most effective technique and that more research is needed.
