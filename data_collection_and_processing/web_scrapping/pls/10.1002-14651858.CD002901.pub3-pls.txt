Digitalis for treatment of heart failure in patients in sinus rhythm
Digitalis is a drug that is extracted from the leaves of the foxglove plant. It contains substances that stimulate heart muscle. The drug has been used for over two centuries to treat heart failure—a condition caused by inability of the injured heart to pump blood adequately. Other drugs that may be useful include diuretics, angiotensin‐converting enzyme inhibitors, and beta‐blockers, but digitalis may also be beneficial. The review of trials found that digitalis reduces hospitalization and can help to relieve symptoms of heart failure. More research is needed to show the full effects of digitalis.
