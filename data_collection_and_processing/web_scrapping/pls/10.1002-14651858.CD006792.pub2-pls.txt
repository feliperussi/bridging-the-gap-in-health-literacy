Corticosteroids for induction of remission in Crohn's disease
Corticosteroids have been used for decades to treat active Crohn's disease. Controlled clinical studies that evaluated the effect of systemic corticosteroids to induce remission in Crohn's disease were reviewed. For inclusion in this analysis, studies could compare any form of corticosteroid that is systemically absorbed (e.g. prednisone, prednisolone, 6‐methylprednisolone or hydrocortisone) to either placebo (fake medicine) or 5‐aminosalicylates (e.g. mesalazine, mesalamine or sulfasalazine). Corticosteroids were found to be more effective than either placebo or 5‐aminosalicylates at inducing remission in Crohn's disease. Although corticosteroids caused side effects more often in patients compared with placebo and 5‐aminosalicylates, these side effects were not serious enough to cause withdrawal from the studies reviewed. In summary, corticosteroids are effective at inducing remission in patients with Crohn's disease. While they cause frequent side effects, these side effects were relatively minor in the reviewed studies, some of which followed patients for up to 24 weeks.
