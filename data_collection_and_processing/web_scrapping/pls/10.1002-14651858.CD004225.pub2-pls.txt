Exercise for diabetic pregnant women
Insufficient information available to recommend or advise against diabetic pregnant women enrolling on exercise programs. 
Exercise was proposed to improve glycaemic control in pregnant women with diabetes. Four small trials involving 114 pregnant women evaluated this intervention. None included pregnant women with type 1 or type 2 diabetes. There is insufficient evidence to recommend, or advise against, diabetic pregnant women enrolling in exercise programs. Further trials, with larger sample size, are needed.
