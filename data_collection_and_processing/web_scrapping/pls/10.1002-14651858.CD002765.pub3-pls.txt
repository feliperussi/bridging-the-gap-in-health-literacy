NSAIDs used for pain relief after surgery may have only small, temporary negative effects on kidney function in adults with normal renal function 
Nonsteroidal anti‚Äêinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) can be used to try and relieve pain after surgery. However, there have been concerns about the possible harmful effects of these drugs on the kidneys. The review of trials found that NSAIDs can cause small, temporary negative effects on the kidneys in adults, but no one in the trials experienced renal failure or serious kidney problems. These results may not apply to children or adults with decreased kidney function
