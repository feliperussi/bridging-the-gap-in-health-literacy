There is not enough evidence to show that lowering body temperature can reduce nerve damage during coronary artery bypass surgery. 
For people with severe coronary artery (heart) disease, bypass surgery can be life saving. However, bypass surgery is sometimes associated with neurological complications, where very occasionally patients may suffer a stroke, or more commonly memory or personality may be affected. The temperature used during bypass surgery may influence these adverse effects. Reducing the temperature during surgery (hypothermia) may protect the brain and reduce the risk of complications. The review of trials found that there was not enough evidence to show the protective effects of hypothermia. More research is needed.
