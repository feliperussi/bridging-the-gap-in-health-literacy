Danshen (Chinese medicinal herb) preparations for acute myocardial infarction
Danshen ‐ a Chinese herbal treatment ‐ is widely used in China in addition to usual western forms of therapy in the treatment of acute myocardial infarction (AMI). However there is no strong evidence to support its use, and few rigorous studies have been conducted. Well designed and conducted randomised controlled trials are needed to provide adequate evidence of its role in the treatment of AMI.
