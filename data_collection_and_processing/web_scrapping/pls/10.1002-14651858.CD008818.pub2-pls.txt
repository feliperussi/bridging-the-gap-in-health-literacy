Donor versus no donor comparison of hematopoietic cell transplantation for adult acute lymphoblastic leukemia in first complete remission 
An area of uncertainty in the care of patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is the choice of treatment that is given after a complete remission is achieved with induction chemotherapy. Therapeutic alternatives include consolidation chemotherapy, autologous transplant (transplantation of a patient's own stem cells) or allogeneic transplant (transplantation utilizing donor stem cells). Clinical trials have come to different conclusions about the best approach. We conducted a systematic review and meta‐analysis to synthesize available clinical research studies that have examined outcome according to donor vs. no donor status, or genetic randomization. This is a method of analysis for assessing the effect of transplantation in this disease condition. Our analysis supports matched sibling donor allogeneic hematopoeitic cell transplantation as the approach which offers the best long‐term outcomes, specifically providing optimal survival and reduced risk for ALL relapse.
