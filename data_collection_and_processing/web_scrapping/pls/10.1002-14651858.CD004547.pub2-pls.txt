Chinese medicinal herbs for cholelithiasis
Cholelithiasis (gallstone disease) causes significant morbidity, severe complications, and economic burden worldwide. Though current surgical therapies are effective for gallstones, some types of gallstones (e.g., calcium bilirubinate calculi) cannot easily be eradicated by surgery and they often recur in the bile duct system, putting people at high risk of severe complications. The objective of this review was to evaluate the benefits and harms of Chinese medicinal herbs for people with cholelithiasis. Though some Chinese medicinal herbs appear to be safe for people with asymptomatic, mild, or moderate disease, they have not been conclusively shown to have curative effects on gallstones due to the low methodological quality (high risk of bias) of the included trials. Thus, randomised clinical trials with low risk of bias should be conducted to assess the effects of Chinese medicinal herbs before they can be used widely in the clinic.
