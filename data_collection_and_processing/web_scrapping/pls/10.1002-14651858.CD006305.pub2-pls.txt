Sanchi for acute ischaemic stroke
Sanchi is one of the most widely used medicinal herbs in China but the present evidence does not allow a conclusion to support its routine use for acute ischaemic stroke. There are very few drugs supported for routine use for acute ischaemic stroke by current evidence. Sanchi may be a potential remedy, which acts through several mechanisms. This review of eight trials, involving 660 participants, indicated that sanchi improved short‐term outcome. However, the evidence from the small sample size and inferior quality of the studies does not support its routine use for acute ischaemic stroke. Well‐designed trials are required.
