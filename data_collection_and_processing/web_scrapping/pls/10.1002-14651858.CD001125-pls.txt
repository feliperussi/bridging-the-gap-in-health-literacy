Cyproterone acetate appears to be as effective as other medications for hirsutism in women caused by excessive androgen production by the ovaries 
One of the causes of hirsutism (excessive hair growth) in women is excessive production of the hormone androgens by the ovaries. A variety of medications can be used to counter the effects of the androgen. Cyproterone acetate is an anti‚Äêandrogen drug. Adverse effects that have been reported with its use include weight gain, depression, fatigue, breast symptoms and sexual dysfunction. The review of trials found that cyproterone acetate appears to have a similar impact on hirsutism as other drugs used for hirsutism caused by excessive androgen. There was not enough evidence to compare adverse effects of the treatment options.
