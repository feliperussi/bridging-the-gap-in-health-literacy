Meta‐analysis using individual participant data or summary aggregate data
Meta‐analysis is a statistical technique to combine results from separate research studies. A meta‐analysis can be performed using summary data published in a study report, referred to as aggregate data (AD), or using data collected on each individual participant in the study, referred to as individual participant data (IPD). A meta‐analysis of individual participant data (IPD‐MA) can take longer and be more expensive than a meta‐analysis of aggregate data (AD‐MA), but the IPD‐MA can be more reliable and can answer much more detailed questions than an AD‐MA. 
We searched for studies, published up to 7 January 2016, that compared results of IPD‐MA with AD‐MA. We found that four times out of five, similar conclusions can be drawn, but in one out of five cases the two different types of meta‐analyses gave different results and conclusions. As we could not reliably identify when an IPD‐MA and AD‐MA will differ most using these studies, we recommend that an AD‐MA should be done first before doing an IPD‐MA. If there are shortcomings with the AD‐MA, researchers should then consider the possible benefits of IPD whilst remembering the extra work involved.
