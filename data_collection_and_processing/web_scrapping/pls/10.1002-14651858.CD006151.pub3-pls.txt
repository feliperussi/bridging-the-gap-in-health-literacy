Surgery versus medication for treating acid reflux in brain‐damaged children having a feeding tube inserted 
Children with cerebral palsy often have oral motor impairment and need help with eating and drinking. Frequently this entails surgery to place a feeding tube (gastrostomy) directly into their stomach. They may also be found to have gastro‐oesophageal reflux (where stomach acid flows back up into the feeding tube (oesophagus)), which can be made worse by gastrostomy surgery. Reflux can be treated either with additional surgery at the same time as the gastrostomy (a fundoplication) or with antireflux medications. We carried out this review to determine which was the safest and most effective form of treatment. We found no randomised controlled trials that provided scientific evidence on which to base a conclusion, highlighting the need for a trial comparing the two interventions.
