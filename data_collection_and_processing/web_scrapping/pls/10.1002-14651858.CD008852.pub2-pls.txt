Calcineurin inhibitor minimisation, ie, reduction or withdrawal, versus continuation of calcineurin inhibitor treatment for liver transplant patients 
Almost every liver transplant recipient is treated with either the drug tacrolimus or the drug cyclosporine to prevent rejection of the transplanted liver. These drugs are part of a group of drugs called calcineurin inhibitors. Both tacrolimus and cyclosporine have serious and common adverse effects and, therefore, dose reduction or discontinuation of these drugs is frequently applied in clinical practice. The aim of the review was to compare reduction or withdrawal of tacrolimus or cyclosporine without substitution with another immunosuppressive agent with continuation of tacrolimus or cyclosporine. Through systematic searches of medical databases we found one ongoing randomised clinical trial investigating total withdrawal of immunosuppressive drugs but, at the time of conducting this review, no trial results on the outcome measures of interest to this review were published. Thus, we cannot reach any conclusion on beneficial or harmful effects of calcineurin inhibitor minimisation for liver transplant recipient patients.
