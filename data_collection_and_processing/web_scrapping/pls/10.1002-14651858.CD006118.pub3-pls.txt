Interventions for psychotic symptoms occurring with epilepsy
Review question 
Little evidence exists to inform the treatment of psychosis in people with epilepsy.
Background 
There is substantial evidence that people suffering from epilepsy have an increased risk of suffering from psychotic symptoms. These symptoms sometimes occur soon after or before the epileptic seizures, but in some cases they can persist for a much longer time, even in the absence of seizures. The management of those suffering from psychosis related to epilepsy is complicated by the fact that most of the drugs used for controlling the symptoms of psychotic disorders can interfere with the effective control of epilepsy and vice versa. 
Study characteristics 
Only one small trial with a total of 16 participants met the inclusion criteria for this review. At present there is a lack of evidence to inform the treatment of psychosis in people with epilepsy, and further randomized controlled trials are needed. 
The last search for trials was conducted in March 2015.
