Milrinone for persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn
Persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN) is a condition caused by a failure in the systemic and pulmonary circulation to convert from the antenatal circulation pattern to the normal postnatal pattern. Due to persistent high pressure in the pulmonary vessels, less than normal blood flows to the lungs and thus less oxygen reaches the organs of the body. Milrinone may cause the pulmonary vessels to relax and allow for an increased oxygen supply for the body. However, the review found no trials of the use of milrinone for babies with persistent pulmonary hypertension. Research is needed into the effects of milrinone on PPHN.
