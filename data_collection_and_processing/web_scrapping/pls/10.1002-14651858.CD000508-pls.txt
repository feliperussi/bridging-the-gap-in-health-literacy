Umbilical artery catheters in the newborn: effects of catheter design (end vs side hole) 
Using umbilical artery catheters with the hole in the side instead of end leads to serious complications. The umbilical artery catheters (tubes) (UACs) commonly used in neonatal intensive care to monitor babies can sometimes cause them problems. They can be used with different accompanying doses of the drug heparin, and in different positions. The design of catheters can vary. The review found that catheters with a hole in the side instead of at the end resulted in one in three babies experiencing aortic thrombosis (a clot in the heart's major artery).
