Combinations of topical fluoride (toothpastes, mouthrinses, gels, varnishes) versus single topical fluoride for preventing dental caries in children and adolescents 
Additional forms of topical fluoride can reduce tooth decay in children and adolescents more than fluoride toothpaste alone, but the extra benefit is not great.  Tooth decay (dental caries) is painful, expensive to treat and can seriously damage teeth. Fluoride is a mineral that prevents tooth decay. Fluoride is added to the water supply in many areas. It can also be applied in the form of toothpastes, mouthrinses, gels or varnishes. The review of trials found that children and adolescents who used another form of topical fluoride in addition to fluoride toothpaste experienced some additional reduction in tooth decay compared with children who only used fluoride toothpaste. However, the additional benefit was not great, and the trials did not provide data about adverse effects.
