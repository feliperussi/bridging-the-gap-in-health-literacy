Parent‐initiated oral corticosteroid therapy for intermittent wheezing illnesses in children 
Oral corticosteroids have been shown to be effective in the treatment of acute asthma in children if they are commenced after the child has been assessed by a doctor. This review identified two randomised trials of parent‐initiated oral corticosteroids in the management of an intermittent wheezing illness in children. There was no evidence of more benefit than harm. Widespread use of this strategy cannot be recommended at present. Further randomised clinical trials are required.
