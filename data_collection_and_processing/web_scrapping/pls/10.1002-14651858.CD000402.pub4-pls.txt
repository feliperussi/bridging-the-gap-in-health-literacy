Hormone therapy for postmenopausal women with intact uterus
Hormone therapy may be used to manage troublesome menopausal symptoms, but is currently recommended to be given at the lowest effective dose and regularly reviewed by a woman and her doctor. In women with an intact uterus hormone therapy comprising estrogen and progestogen is desirable to minimise the risk of endometrial hyperplasia, which can develop into endometrial cancer. Low‐dose estrogen plus progestogen (minimum of 1 mg norethisterone acetate or 1.5 mg medroxyprogesterone acetate) taken daily (continuously) appears to be safe for the endometrium. For women who had their last menstrual period less than one year ago low‐dose estrogen combined sequentially with 10 days of progestogen (1 mg norethisterone acetate) per month appears to be safe for the endometrium.
