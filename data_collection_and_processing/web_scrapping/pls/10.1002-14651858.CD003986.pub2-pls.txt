Excitatory amino acid inhibiting drugs for traumatic brain injury
Brain injury can start a cascade of damage to brain tissue. Release into the brain of excess excitatory amino acids is thought to begin this process. Drugs which stop the release of excitatory amino acids or which block them may reduce brain damage. Studies have been done in patients with stroke as well as traumatic brain injury. The review found that the results from most drug trials with brain injured patients have not been published. There is therefore not enough evidence about the effects of excitatory amino acid inhibiting drugs for traumatic brain injury, and more published trials are needed.
