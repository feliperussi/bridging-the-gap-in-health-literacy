Nicotine for schizophrenia
People with schizophrenia tend to smoke heavily and to a greater extent when compared to other patient groups. In this review we aimed to investigate this by searching for good quality evidence from randomised controlled trials on the effect of nicotine for schizophrenia, and/or to ascertain whether nicotine modifies the side effects of antipsychotics. Unfortunately we found no trials that met our inclusion criteria to support or refute this. There is a need for good quality randomised controlled trials that investigate the effects of nicotine for schizophrenia.
