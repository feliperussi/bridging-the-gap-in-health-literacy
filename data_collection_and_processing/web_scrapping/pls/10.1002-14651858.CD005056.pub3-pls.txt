Paracervical local anaesthesia for cervical dilatation and uterine interventions
Paracervical block involves injection of local anaesthetic around the cervix to numb nearby nerves. Cervical dilatation and uterine interventions (such as hysteroscopy, endometrial biopsies, fractional curettage, and suction terminations) can be performed without any analgesia or anaesthesia; with regional anaesthetic injections as with paracervical block; using oral or intravenous analgesics and sedatives; or under general anaesthesia. Many gynaecologists use paracervical block for uterine intervention but it is unclear how effective and safe this method is. We included nine new studies in this updated review with a total of 26 studies involving 2790 women undergoing uterine interventions. The women were randomly allocated to paracervical block or an alternative. We found that, statistically, women had significantly less pain during cervical dilatation and uterine intervention with paracervical block than with placebo injection (saline or water) but clinically this difference may be unimportant. Paracervical block had no effect in five uncontrolled studies. There was no evidence that paracervical block reduced pain compared to alternative regional anaesthetic methods or systemic analgesics and sedatives. There was little information on important side effects. After updating, this review found that no local anaesthetic technique prevented pain as well as one would expect from general anaesthesia.
