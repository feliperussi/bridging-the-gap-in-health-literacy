Neostigmine for reversing muscle paralysis in children following surgery
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about whether neostigmine should be routinely used to prevent residual muscle paralysis in children who received muscle relaxants during surgery. 
Background 
Neuromuscular blocks are drugs that cause paralysis of the skeletal muscles. They are used to facilitate certain surgical procedures. Residual muscle paralysis after surgery is associated with serious complications in children such as low oxygen content (hypoxia). Neostigimine is a drug that is used to reverse the effects of neuromuscular blocks. Neostigime reduces the risk of paralysis, but it can also cause children to feel sick and vomit and to produce excessive saliva and have a slow heart rate (bradycardia). As risk of residual paralysis is lower in children than in adults after neuromuscular blocks, the use of neostigmine in all surgeries performed on children should be carefully considered. 
Study characteristics 
This evidence is current to August 2013. We found no study that satisfied the inclusion criteria. 
Key results 
We found only one study that is awaiting classification. No RCTs supported, or argued against, the routine use of neostigmine to reverse neuromuscular block in paediatric patients. 
Quality of the evidence 
We found no relevant evidence.
