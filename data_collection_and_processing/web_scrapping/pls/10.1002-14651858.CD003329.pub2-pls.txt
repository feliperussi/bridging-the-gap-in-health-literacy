Psychological interventions for depression in heart failure
It is not known whether psychological interventions for people with heart failure reduce symptoms of depression and improve outcome. Occasionally adults with heart failure suffer from depression. Psychological interventions, such as cognitive‚Äêbehavioural therapy and other types of counseling or supportive therapy, have been tried in order to reduce depression. Unfortunately, this review found no randomised trials of psychological interventions aimed at reducing depression in heart failure patients. Less carefully conducted studies, however, suggest that small reductions in the symptoms of depression and improvements in exercise capacity might result from psychological interventions.
