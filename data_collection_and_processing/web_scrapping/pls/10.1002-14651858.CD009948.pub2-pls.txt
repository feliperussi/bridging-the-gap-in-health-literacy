Cetuximab: a new treatment for advanced non‐small cell lung cancer
Lung cancer is the most common cancer in the world. Advanced non‐small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) accounts for about 60% of all lung cancer cases. Since the effectiveness of current standard treatment for advanced NSCLC (i.e. chemotherapy) has reached a ceiling, there is a continuous need for new, more effective treatments to further improve the outcome of patients with the disease. This review of 2018 patients, from four trials, found that adding cetuximab (a newly developed agent) to standard treatment, prolonged the survival time of advanced NSCLC patients by about 1.5 months, and deferred the progression of cancer by about 0.5 month. One year after the treatment, 45% of the patients receiving standard treatment plus cetuximab, and 40% of the patients receiving standard treatment alone were still alive. However, the effects of cetuximab on quality of life of patients were uncertain. Seven types of adverse events, mainly involving skin and blood, occurred much more in the patients receiving cetuximab, while other adverse events seemed to occur equally in both groups. The adverse events were reported as generally manageable. No deaths related to cetuximab were reported. In summary, high quality evidence shows that the use of cetuximab combined with standard treatment leads to better survival than standard treatment alone, in improving survival of patients with advanced NSCLC.
