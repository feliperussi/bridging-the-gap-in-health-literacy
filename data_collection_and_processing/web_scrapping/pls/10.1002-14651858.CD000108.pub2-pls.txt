Biochemical tests of placental function for assessment in pregnancy
Testing women's hormone levels during high‐risk pregnancy has not been shown to benefit women or their babies. 
The placenta provides nourishment for the baby in the womb (uterus) during pregnancy. It has been thought that testing women's hormone levels during pregnancy, might show how well the placenta is functioning and whether the baby is growing as would be expected. (Hormones are natural chemicals produced in the body.) The review of one trial (622 women) found some evidence that measuring (o)estriol levels in high‐risk pregnancies did not affect the outcome of the pregnancy.
