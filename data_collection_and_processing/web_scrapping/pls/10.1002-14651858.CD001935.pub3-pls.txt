Oral or topical nasal steroids for hearing loss associated with otitis media with effusion (glue ear) in children 
Glue ear (otitis media with effusion ‐ OME) is sticky fluid in the middle ear that does not cause pain or fever but can reduce hearing. Steroid drugs (taken orally or as nose spray) are sometimes used to try to speed up the resolution of effusion and so prevent hearing loss. Other treatment options include oral antibiotics and other medicines, or surgical procedures such as grommets (ventilation tubes). This review of trials found that oral steroids (especially when used in combination with antibiotics) speeded up the resolution of OME in the short term. However, there was no long‐term evidence to show lasting benefit or improved hearing. There was no evidence that using steroid drugs as a nose spray benefited children with OME.
