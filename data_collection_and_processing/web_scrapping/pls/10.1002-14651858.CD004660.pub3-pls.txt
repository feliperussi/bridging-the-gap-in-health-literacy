Caesarean section for non‚Äêmedical reasons at term
Childbirth is a profound and powerful human experience. Women often describe feelings of empowerment, elation and achievement, although other women's experiences include trauma, fear, pain, and loss of control. The way women give birth, either vaginally or by caesarean section, is likely to impact on their feelings. In recent years, caesareans have become safer due to improved anaesthesia and improved surgical techniques, along with the routine use of drugs at surgery to combat the increased risk of infection and blood clots in the mother. However, caesarean section remains a surgical procedure accompanied by abdominal and uterine incisions, scarring and adhesions. There is also evidence of an increased chance of problems in subsequent pregnancies for both women and babies. 
This review found no trials to help assess the risks and benefits of caesarean section when undertaken without a conventional medical indication. The authors strongly recommend the use of alternative research methods to gather data on the outcomes associated with different ways of giving birth.
