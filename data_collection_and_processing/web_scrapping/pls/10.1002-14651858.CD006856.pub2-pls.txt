One study shows promise for Personal Assistance delivered to adults with physical impairments: more research is needed 
Personal assistance is is here defined as paid support of at least 20 hours per week for people with impairments. This review investigated the effectiveness of personal assistance versus any other form of care for adults with physical impairments. A literature search identified one study that met the inclusion criteria, which included 817 participants. It suggests that personal assistance may be preferred over other services; however, some people prefer other models of care. This review indicates that personal assistance may have some benefits for some recipients and their informal caregivers. Paid assistance might substitute for informal care and cost government more than alternative arrangements; however, the relative total costs to recipients and society are unknown.
