The benefits and side effects of adding upfront whole brain radiotherapy to surgery or radiosurgery for treatment of brain metastases 
Background   For certain patients with a single brain metastasis, surgery to remove the single brain metastasis may be undertaken.  For certain patients with small brain metastatic disease, a highly focused single radiation treatment called radiosurgery, may be used.  It is unclear the benefits and side effects of adding upfront (i.e. a therapy given to previously untreated patients) whole brain radiation to surgery or radiosurgery.  We wanted to establish whether adding upfront whole brain radiation to surgery or radiosurgery was a useful treatment for brain metastases. 
Study characteristics   We included five studies. These studies reported the effect of adding whole brain radiation to surgery or radiosurgery in terms of survival, brain disease progression, quality of life and treatment side effects. The sample size of these studies ranged from 19 to 359 patients. 
Key findings   Adding whole brain radiotherapy to surgery or radiosurgery reduces brain metastases progression rates substantially but there was no clear evidence of an effect on survival and it is unclear whether it may cause side effects such as memory loss. 
Quality of the evidence   We considered the evidence on survival, intracranial disease progression, neurocognitive function, quality of life and treatment side effects to be of low quality.
