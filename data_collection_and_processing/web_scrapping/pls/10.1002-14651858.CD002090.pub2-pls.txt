Amphetamines for improving recovery after stroke
A stroke interrupts the blood flow to the brain, often leading to damage to some functions of the brain. This can cause persisting paralysis of some parts of the body or other difficulties with various physical functions. Experiments in animals have shown that amphetamines (stimulants) might be able to improve recovery from stroke. The mechanisms behind the faster recovery seen after stroke in animals are not clearly understood. This review identified 10 small randomized trials of amphetamines in patients with stroke. There was no evidence that amphetamines did more good than harm. There is not enough evidence to support the routine use of amphetamines to promote recovery after stroke. Further controlled trials are needed.
