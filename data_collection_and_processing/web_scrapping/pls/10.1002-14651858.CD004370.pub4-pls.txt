Intravenous immunoglobulin for presumed viral myocarditis in children and adults
Background 
Acute myocarditis is inflammation of the heart and is thought to most commonly begin as a viral infection. The disease affects individuals of all ages. On the basis of multiple case reports and case series, intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) has become part of routine practice for treating adults and children with acute myocarditis at many centres. 
Results 
This is the second update of a previous review, which found one randomised controlled trial (RCT) (a type of study in which participants are assigned to one of two or more treatment groups using a random method) of 62 adults, which suggested that IVIG is not useful in myocarditis. The evidence in this update is current to 2 July 2019, at which point two studies were added: one RCT of 86 children did not find any evidence that IVIG increases survival over placebo, and one RCT of 41 adults did not find evidence of increased survival (less mortality), but did report that patients lived longer for the group treated with IVIG compared to the untreated group. After pooling the available data, there was uncertain evidence of the effect of IVIG in preventing deaths. More RCT evidence is required before IVIG can be routinely recommended for adults or children with myocarditis.
