Adhesives for bonded molar tubes during fixed brace treatment
Background 
Orthodontic treatment involves using fixed or removable dental braces to correct the positions of teeth. The success of dental braces depends partly on the metal attachments (brackets and bands) being glued to the teeth so that they do not become detached during treatment. Brackets (metal squares) are usually attached to teeth other than molars, where bands (metal rings that go round each tooth) are more commonly used. Orthodontic tubes (stainless steel tubes that allow wires to pass through them), are typically welded to bands but they may also be glued directly (bonded) to molars. Failure of brackets, bands and bonded molar tubes slows down the progress of treatment with a dental brace. 
Study characteristics 
The evidence in this review, which was carried out together with Cochrane Oral Health, is up‐to‐date as of 15 February 2017. We included two studies that evaluated 190 participants. Both trials were conducted in the UK and both compared bonded molar tubes with molar bands. 
Key results 
From the limited data of two studies at low risk of bias, it would appear that bonded molar tubes are associated with a higher failure rate than with molar bands.
