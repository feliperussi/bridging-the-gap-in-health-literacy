Simultaneous bilateral training for improving arm function after stroke
After a stroke, arm problems are common and their recovery is often limited. This review of 18 studies with 549 relevant participants looked at whether performing identical activities with both arms at the same time (simultaneous bilateral training) could improve performance in daily (or extended daily) activities, movement of the arm and/or reduce arm impairments. In comparison with usual care, bilateral training had no effect on performance in activities of daily living, functional movement of the arm or hand, performance in extended activities of daily living or motor impairment outcomes. In comparison with other arm interventions, bilateral training had no effect on performance in activities of daily living, functional movement of the arm or hand or motor impairment outcomes. One study found that people who undertook bilateral training showed less improvement in performance in extended activities of daily living than people doing another arm intervention. The evidence in this area is limited. Further research is needed to determine the effects of bilateral training.
