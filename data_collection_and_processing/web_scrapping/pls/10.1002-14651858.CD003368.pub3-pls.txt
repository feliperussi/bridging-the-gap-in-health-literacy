Addition of drugs to a chemotherapy regimen for metastatic breast cancer
Advanced breast cancer is treatable but not curable. Women with advanced breast cancer have an average survival of about 2 years, although some women may live for many years beyond this. Therefore, it is important to investigate different chemotherapy treatment options. Chemotherapy can improve survival for women with metastatic breast cancer, but it can also cause toxic side effects. Of interest is whether there is any benefit by adding additional chemotherapy drugs, particularly given the potential harm caused by more dose‚Äêintensive treatment. This review investigated the value of adding one or more chemotherapy drugs to a chemotherapy regimen. We found that the addition of chemotherapy drug/s to a regimen caused greater shrinkage of the tumour seen with imaging but increased toxicity. There is insufficient evidence to determine if there is an impact on time to disease progression and overall survival.
