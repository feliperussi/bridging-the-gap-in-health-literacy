Percutaneous needle aspiration, injection, and re‐aspiration with or without benzimidazole coverage for uncomplicated hepatic hydatid cysts 
Two randomised clinical trials on the puncture, aspiration, injection, and re‐aspiration method for patients with uncomplicated hepatic hydatid cyst were identified. One trial compared puncture, aspiration, injection, and re‐aspiration with surgical treatment. The other trial compared puncture, aspiration, injection, and re‐aspiration with or without albendazole with albendazole alone. Both trials had high risk of bias. The number of participants enrolled and the follow‐up duration are insufficient for a definite conclusion to be drawn. In general, there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the puncture, aspiration, injection, and re‐aspiration method with or without benzimidazole coverage for patients with uncomplicated hepatic hydatid cyst.
