Antithrombin for respiratory distress syndrome in preterm infants
Antithrombin (AT) is a substance that is produced by the liver and that plays an important role in the control of blood clotting and the subsequent breakdown of the clot. Critically ill infants, such as those born prematurely with immature lungs leading to respiratory distress (Respiratory Distress Syndrome; RDS) have low concentrations of AT in the blood. Studies have been conducted to examine whether preterm infants with RDS benefit from the administration of AT. In our systematic review, we found that preterm infants with RDS do not benefit from therapy with AT and may be harmed.
