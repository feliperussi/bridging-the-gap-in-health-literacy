Oral corticosteroids for stable chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a common, progressive lung disorder with mainly non‐reversible limitation of airflow. Corticosteroids improve airflow limitation in asthma and have been tried in COPD. This review found treatment with oral steroids improved lung function and symptoms more than placebo, but not all people benefited equally. Long‐term use did not slow the decline in lung function and there was an increased risk of side‐effects such as diabetes and osteoporosis.
