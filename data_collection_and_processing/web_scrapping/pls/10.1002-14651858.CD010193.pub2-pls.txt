The Lund concept in the treatment of brain injuries
Background 
Brain injuries are a significant cause of death and permanent disability. It is recognised that the magnitude of the injury is not defined at the moment of the injury, but rather develops in the hours and days that follow. Treatment in the hours following brain injury is aimed at the maintenance of adequate brain blood flow and the prevention of brain swelling. The Lund concept differs from conventional treatment strategies in emphasising the pressures inside small blood vessels in the brain. 
Study characteristics 
We searched the medical literature in order to find randomised controlled trials (RCTs) (studies where people are randomly assigned to a treatment or non‚Äêtreatment group) that compared the Lund concept versus other treatments. We included people with severe traumatic brain injury, irrespective of their gender, age or race. The latest search was 5 November 2013. 
Key results 
We found no studies comparing the Lund concept versus other treatments. There is no evidence from RCTs that the Lund concept is a preferable treatment for brain injury and further research is needed.
