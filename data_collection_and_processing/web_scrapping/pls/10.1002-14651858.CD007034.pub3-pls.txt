Two dialysis solutions for acute peritoneal dialysis
Acute kidney injury (AKI) can be treated with either bicarbonate or lactate in acute peritoneal dialysis (PD). The aim of this review was to compare the effectiveness of bicarbonate versus lactate solution. 
We identified only one small randomised controlled trial (RCT) (20 patients) after an extensive literature search, and we found no difference between bicarbonate and lactate for clinically important outcomes, such as mortality and adverse events. An initial reported benefit of bicarbonate over lactate was not confirmed by subsequent studies. In this systematic review of one RCT of patients with AKI, no significance difference was demonstrable between these two dialysis solutions.
