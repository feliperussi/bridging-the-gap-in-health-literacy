Not enough evidence on effectiveness of drugs or preventive measures on disease caused by Cryptosporidium. 
Cryptosporidiosis is a disease that causes diarrhoea, and can be life‚Äêthreatening in individuals whose bodies are not able to resist infections. It causes disease in the both the developed and the developing world. This review of trials found insufficient evidence to say whether any drug is able to reduce or cure the symptoms of Cryptosporidium infection or to effectively kill the organism among individuals who cannot resist infections. A limited amount of evidence was found indicating that the drug nitaxozanide can kill the organism in individuals with a normal immunity.
