Drugs in overactive bladder syndrome
Overactive bladder syndrome is characterised by a need to rush to urinate ‐ urine is passed frequently and there may be incontinence. The main treatment option is drug therapy. The most commonly used drugs are anticholinergics, but these often have side‐effects, such as dry mouth. This review sought evidence to compare other types of drugs with anticholinergics. Only a few, small‐scale randomised trials were found, many testing drugs that are no longer used clinically. The review found inadequate evidence to assess whether or not available alternative drugs are better or worse than anticholinergics in the management of people with symptoms of overactive bladder syndrome.
