No evidence to support the use of thioridazine for dementia
Behavioural problems are common in dementia and are a significant source of caregiver burden. Thioridazine has significant sedative effect, and it is thought that this is the main mechanism of action in calming and controlling the patient. However, pharmacologically, it also has marked anticholinergic properties that could potentially have a detrimental effect on cognitive function. The only positive effect of thioridazine when compared with placebo is to reduce anxiety. When compared with placebo, other neuroleptics, and other sedatives it has equal or higher rates of adverse effects. Thioridazine has minimal or no effect on global ratings, while other drugs such as chlormethiazole are superior to it on behavioural ratings. Clinicians should be aware that there is no evidence to support the use of thioridazine in dementia, and its use may expose patients to excess side effects.
