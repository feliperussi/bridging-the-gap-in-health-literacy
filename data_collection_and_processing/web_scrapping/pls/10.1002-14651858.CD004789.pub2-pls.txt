D‐penicillamine did not reduce the risk of mortality of patients with primary biliary cirrhosis but increased the occurrences of adverse events 
Primary biliary cirrhosis is an uncommon, chronic liver disease of unknown etiology. D‐penicillamine, a cupruretic drug, has been tested in randomised clinical trials and is used to treat patients with primary biliary cirrhosis. After combining results from seven trials, D‐penicillamine did not appear to improve survival of patients. D‐penicillamine was associated with a four‐time increase of adverse events. There were no significant differences between D‐penicillamine and placebo/no intervention with respect to clinical changes, liver histology, and liver biochemistry.
