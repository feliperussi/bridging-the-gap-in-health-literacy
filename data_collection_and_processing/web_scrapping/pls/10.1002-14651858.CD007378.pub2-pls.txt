Colonic stenting has no decisive advantages to Emergency surgery.
Emergency surgical decompression has been the traditional treatment of choice for the malignant colorectal tumours presenting as an acute obstruction. This is associated with higher morbidity and mortality due to the emergency nature of the procedure along with other existing co morbidities. This systematic review of five randomised trial shows higher rates of clinical relief of obstruction in emergency surgery. Colonic stent has not been shown to be as effective as emergency surgery in malignant colorectal obstructions. However, use of colonic stent is associated with comparable mortality and morbidity with advantage of shorter hospital stay and procedure time and less blood loss. Further randomised controlled trials with larger sample size and robust trial design are required on this topic.
