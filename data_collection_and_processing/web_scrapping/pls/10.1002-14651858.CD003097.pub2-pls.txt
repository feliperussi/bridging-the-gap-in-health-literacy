Hyaluronidase for cervical ripening and induction of labour
Hyaluronidase injected into the cervix increased cervical favourability but its effect on induction of labour is unknown and its use is not recommended. 
Sometimes it is considered beneficial to bring labour on artificially and there are many methods currently used. One method is an injection of hyaluronidase into the cervix. The review of trials found one study, which showed hyaluronidase was more effective than placebo, resulting in fewer caesarean sections, less oxytocin augmentation and greater cervical favourability. However, it is an invasive procedure that women may find unacceptable in the presence of less invasive methods of cervical ripening. Given this, the review authors do not recommend it for clinical practice.
