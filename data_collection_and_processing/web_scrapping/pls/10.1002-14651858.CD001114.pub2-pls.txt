Corticosteroids for pulmonary sarcoidosis
Sarcoidosis is a common disease that can affect several parts of the body. The cause of the disease is unknown, and it often gets better without treatment. Sarcoidosis is more likely among some ethnic groups (including African‐Americans and African‐Caribbeans), for whom the disease has worse outcomes. When sarcoidosis affects the lungs, it can cause breathlessness, coughs, and lung problems, and lead to more complications and death. The review of trials found that using corticosteroids for lung sarcoidosis leads to some short‐term benefit in terms of chest x‐ray, but there is limited evidence that this benefit lasts or affects the long term outcomes of the disease.
