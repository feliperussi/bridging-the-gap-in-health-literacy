A tube fitted inside a vein to allow drug injections for people with cystic fibrosis
Cystic fibrosis blocks the lungs with mucus and causes frequent infections and lung damage. Infections are often treated by giving drugs intravenously (through a vein), but regular injections can damage veins. Another option is to use a totally implantable vascular access device (TIVAD). There are different types of device and people with cystic fibrosis or their families can be shown how to administer drugs through them. TIVADs have no external portion attached when not in use and long‐term maintenance is quite easy. Some people feel that the devices improve their self‐image while others do not like the way they look. Sometimes TIVADs cause blood clots and infections. We looked for randomised and quasi‐randomised controlled trials of these devices in people with cystic fibrosis. The review found no trials to include. Reports of the use of TIVADs in people with cystic fibrosis suggest that they are safe and effective. They also suggest that certain interventions might reduce the risk of complications; however, these issues have not been examined by randomised controlled trials. We think a multicentre randomised controlled trial is needed to assess the efficacy and possible adverse effects of TIVADs in cystic fibrosis.
