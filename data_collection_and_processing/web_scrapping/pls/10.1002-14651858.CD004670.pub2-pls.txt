No evidence from randomised controlled trials for or against the use of Zhiling concoction in the treatment of people with vascular dementia 
Zhiling is a decoction of 15 Chinese herbs which is thought to contribute to dilating cerebral vessels and increasing cerebral blood flow, as well as reducing serum cholesterol. No randomised controlled trials of Zhiling decoction versus placebo were found and thus its efficacy and safety could not be analysed in this review. There is a need for randomised placebo controlled trials of Zhiling decoction.
