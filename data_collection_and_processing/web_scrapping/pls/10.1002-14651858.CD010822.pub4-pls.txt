Gene therapy for haemophilia
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the safety and effectiveness of gene therapy for treating people with haemophilia A or haemophilia B. 
Background 
Haemophilia is a bleeding disorder caused by defective genes that produce abnormal blood clotting proteins. Gene therapy modifies or replaces these defective genes with normal ones. We looked for trials that used this approach of modifying or replacing defective genes for producing normal blood clotting proteins for the treatment of haemophilia. This is an update of a published Cochrane Review. 
Search date 
The evidence is current to: 17 April 2020.
Key results 
We found no trials to provide reliable evidence about the risks or benefits of gene therapy for haemophilia. There is a need for trials that assess the long‚Äêterm feasibility, success and risks of gene therapy for people with haemophilia.
