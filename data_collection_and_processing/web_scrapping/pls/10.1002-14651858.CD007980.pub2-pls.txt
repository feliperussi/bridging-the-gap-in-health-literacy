The effects of using email to send test results to patients
As medical care becomes more complex and the ability to test for conditions grows, pressure on healthcare providers to convey increasing volumes of test results to patients is leading to consideration of different ways to deliver the results to patients.This review searched for high‐quality research studies to try to determine how effective sending test results via email to patients or caregivers is, and what the outcomes are for patients/caregivers, healthcare professionals and health services. We found no studies that looked at the effects of using email for sending test results to patients, and so cannot present any results. We recommend that high‐quality research is carried out to examine the use of email for this purpose.
