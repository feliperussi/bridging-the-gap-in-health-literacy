Benzodiazepines for restless legs syndrome
Background 
Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a common and distressing disease affecting 5% to 15% of the population. Many physicians are still unaware of the disease and do not recognize its symptoms. This disease can affect sleep significantly, impairing quality of life. There is a need for safe and effective treatment for RLS. Current treatments include dopamine agonists, anticonvulsants, and opioids. 
Question 
Are benzodiazepines effective and safe for people with RLS?
Methods 
We searched the literature for studies in any language, published or not, that considered benzodiazepines for the treatment of RLS. 
Results 
No studies were included in the review.
Discussion 
Benzodiazepines have been used for a long time in people with RLS, because these drugs help sleep initiation and maintenance. As there was no properly conducted systematic review on the effectiveness of benzodiazepines, we performed one on this topic. 
Conclusion 
This systematic review shows that there is no good data to support or refute the use of benzodiazepines to treat symptoms of RLS.
