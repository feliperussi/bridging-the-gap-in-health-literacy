Bicarbonate‐ versus lactate‐buffered solutions for acute continuous haemodiafiltration or haemofiltration 
People with acute kidney injury (AKI) have serious loss of kidney function and are unable to rid wastes from the body in urine. People with AKI need dialysis (haemofiltration) which requires use of buffered solutions (dialysates) to rid waste from their blood. Different dialysates can have various effects on the balance of blood chemistry. Maintaining balanced blood chemistry helps to reduce risks of heart, blood circulation and blood pressure problems. We assessed the benefits and harms of bicarbonate‐buffered solutions and lactate‐buffered solutions by analysing results from four randomised controlled studies that together involved 171 participants. The evidence was flawed by study design and reporting problems, and the small number of people in the studies. Based on limited evidence from one study (117 participants), we found that people treated with bicarbonate‐buffered solutions may experience fewer heart and blood circulation problems and high blood pressure events. The studies did not include enough evidence to make recommendations about the use of these solutions.
