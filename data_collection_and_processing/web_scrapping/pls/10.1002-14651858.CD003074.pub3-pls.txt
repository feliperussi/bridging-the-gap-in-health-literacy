Once versus twice daily injections of low molecular weight heparin for the initial treatment of blood clots in the veins 
Blood clots in the veins (venous thromboembolism (VTE)) can develop spontaneously or after surgery or bed rest. Venous thromboembolism can be life threatening if clots travel to the lungs. Blood‐thinning drugs such as heparin are used to dissolve clots. Low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) can be given by injection, enabling people to leave hospital. The usual treatment is two injections a day, but once a day would be more convenient. This review included five studies with a combined total of 1508 participants. The combined data showed no statistically significant difference in recurrent VTE between the once daily and twice daily treatment regimens. A comparison of major bleeding events, improvement of the blood clot size and death also showed no statistically significant difference between the two treatment regimens. None of the five included studies reported information on post‐thrombotic syndrome (ongoing swelling of the affected leg, pain, and skin changes). One daily injection with LMWH is therefore as effective and safe as twice daily injections.
