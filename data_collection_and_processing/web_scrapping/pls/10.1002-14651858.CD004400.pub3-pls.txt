Granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G‐CSF), when given with antibiotics, does not appear to reduce mortality in adults with pneumonia 
Pneumonia, or infection involving the lungs, is responsible for a significant number of deaths worldwide. Pneumonia is especially life‐threatening in older people and people with other illnesses that may affect the immune system (such as diabetes). In addition to antibiotics, granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G‐CSF) has been suggested as a possible option for treatment. G‐CSF stimulates the production of white blood cells that fight infection, and is used for people with cancer after chemotherapy, and in febrile neutropenia (infection associated with very low levels of white cells). The review of trials found that, when combined with antibiotics, G‐CSF appears to be a safe treatment for people with pneumonia, but it does not appear to reduce mortality. More research is needed to define the optimal timing of dosing (earlier, or prophylactically before the onset of infection) and possible problems when given to patients with severe infection.
