Depot bromperidol decanoate for schizophrenia
Bromperidol decanoate is used as a long‚Äêacting antipsychotic medication in at least Belgium, Germany, Italy and the Netherlands. The preparation seems to be less potent than other depot antipsychotics (such as fluphenazine and haloperidol decanoate) and better than placebo injection. However, this older antipsychotic preparation has very few data from good quality studies and new trials are needed to fully understand the effects of this preparation.
