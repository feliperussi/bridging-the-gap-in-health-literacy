Extubation from low‚Äêrate intermittent positive airway pressure versus extubation after a trial of endotracheal continuous positive airway pressure in intubated preterm infants 
There is no evidence that time on endotracheal CPAP (continuous low pressure rather than intermittent breaths from the ventilator) before taking preterm babies off a ventilator helps them adjust to breathing on their own. Babies in neonatal intensive care often need help to breathe, sometimes via an endotracheal tube (through the windpipe) connected to a mechanical ventilator. It was thought that it might help a baby adjust to breathing after ventilation if there was a period of CPAP (continuous positive airways pressure) before extubation (coming off the ventilator). However, there have also been concerns that this may create too much work for the baby, and may cause harm. This review found that a trial of CPAP before extubation does not improve the baby's ability to breathe on their own.
