What is trigger finger and corticosteroid injection? 
Trigger finger is a disease of the tendons of the finger, which makes the finger difficult to straighten.  It causes snapping or locking of the affected finger when flexing or stretching. Sometimes it can cause the hand to become painful.  
Corticosteroid injections are shots with a needle into a joint (such as your finger) or a tendon.  Corticosteroids work by reducing the inflammation of the finger.  The injection itself might also help to relieve the pressure on the tendon. 
Best estimate of what happens after a corticosteroid injection: 
37 out of 100 people benefited from corticosteroid injection combined with a painkiller; compared to 17 out of 100 people who benefited following injection with a painkiller only.
