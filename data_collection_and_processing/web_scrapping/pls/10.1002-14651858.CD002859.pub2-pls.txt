Prevention of recurrent miscarriage for women with antiphospholipid antibody or lupus anticoagulant 
Treatments for recurrent miscarriage when there are antibodies in the mothers blood.
Miscarriage can be very distressing for parents and their families. Miscarriage is sometimes associated with substances in the mother blood called 'antiphospholipid antibodies' or 'lupus anticoagulant'. These antibodies are associated with clotting and so it is suggested that anticlotting drugs may be helpful. The review found the quality of the included trials was quite variable, and that prednisone appears to have adverse effects so it has no role in the treatment of recurrent miscarriage. However, a combination of unfractionated heparin with aspirin may be helpful but there are potential side‚Äêeffects for mothers. More research is needed.
