Extracranial‐intracranial arterial bypass surgery for occlusive carotid artery disease
Patients with symptomatic occlusion (obstruction) of the carotid artery have a high risk of subsequent stroke. Anticoagulant treatment and antiplatelet agents are not very effective in these patients and a surgical procedure known as extracranial‐intracranial (EC/IC) arterial bypass surgery has been a treatment option. In this review, we included 21 trials (two randomised controlled trials and 19 non‐random studies, with a total of 2591 patients). We found that EC/IC bypass surgery in patients with symptomatic carotid artery occlusive disease was no better or worse than medical care alone. A multi‐centre trial comparing EC/IC bypass surgery with best medical treatment in patients with both a high risk of stroke and haemodynamic compromise (impaired blood flow) is underway, and aims to discover whether EC/IC bypass surgery is beneficial in this specific group of patients.
