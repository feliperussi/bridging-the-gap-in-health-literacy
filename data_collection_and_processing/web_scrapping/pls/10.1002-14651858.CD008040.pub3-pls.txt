Paracetamol (acetaminophen) with or without an antiemetic for acute migraine in adults
This is an updated version of the original Cochrane review published in Issue 11, 2010 (Derry 2010). New searches identified one additional study for inclusion; this study compared paracetamol with etodolac and did not contribute to any of the analyses in the review. 
A single oral dose of paracetamol 1000 mg will reduce headache pain from moderate or severe to none by 2 hours in 1 in 5 people (19%) taking paracetamol, compared with 1 in 10 (10%) taking placebo. Pain will be reduced from moderate or severe to no worse than mild pain by 2 hours in about 1 in 2 people (56%) taking paracetamol, compared with about 1 in 3 (36%) taking placebo. Too few data were available to assess efficacy beyond 2 hours. 
Paracetamol 1000 mg plus metoclopramide 10 mg and oral sumatriptan 100 mg provide similar levels of headache relief at 2 hours. There was insufficient information to compare paracetamol, alone or in combination, with other active treatments. 
Adverse events do not differ significantly between paracetamol and placebo. Slightly more serious and/or severe adverse events occur with sumatriptan 100 mg than with paracetamol 1000 mg plus metoclopramide 10 mg.
