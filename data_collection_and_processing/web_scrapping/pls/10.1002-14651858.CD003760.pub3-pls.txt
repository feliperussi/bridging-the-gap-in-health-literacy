Behavioural and cognitive behavioural training interventions for assisting foster carers in the management of difficult behaviour 
Providing training for foster carers is thought to enhance caring attitudes and skills, help foster carers deal more effectively with foster children's behaviour, and decrease foster carer attrition. Although training programs have proliferated, there has been minimal evaluative research to determine whether they are effective.  This review attempted to determine the effectiveness of cognitive‐behavioural training interventions. Only six trials involving 463 foster carers were included. Results suggest little evidence of effect on looked‐after children, foster carers and fostering agency outcomes.
