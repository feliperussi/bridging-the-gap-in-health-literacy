Chinese herbal medicine suxiao jiuxin wan for angina pectoris
Angina pectoris is pain or discomfort within the chest, typically provoked by exertion or anxiety. Angina is a sign that someone is at increased risk of heart attack, cardiac arrest or sudden cardiac death. The aim of treatment for angina is to control the symptoms and prevent a cardiovascular event such as a heart attack. In western medicine, treatment is usually with beta blockers, calcium channel blockers and nitrates (nitroglycerin). Suxiao jiuxin wan is widely used in China in conjunction with these western treatments. This review found weak evidence to suggest suxiao jiuxin wan alone or in combination with other anti‚Äêanginal drugs reduces the symptoms of angina. However, because of the quality of the research, the role of suxiao jiuxin wan is uncertain and more high quality trials are required to assess the effects of suxiao jiuxin wan in the long term.
