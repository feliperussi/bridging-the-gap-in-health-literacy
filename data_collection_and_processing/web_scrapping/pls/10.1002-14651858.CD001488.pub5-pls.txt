Educating people with diabetes about foot care to help reduce foot ulcers and amputations
Foot ulcers (open sores) are common in people with diabetes, especially those with problems in the nerves (peripheral neuropathy), the blood supply to their legs (peripheral vascular disease (PVD)), or both. People with ulcers due to diabetes sometimes need an amputation (surgical removal of part of the limb). Foot ulcers not only lead to physical disability and loss of quality of life but also to economic burden (healthcare costs, industrial disability). The aim is therefore to prevent foot ulcers occurring. This review of high‚Äêlevel studies found that educating people with diabetes about the need to look after their feet seems to improve people's foot care knowledge and behaviour in the short term. There is insufficient evidence that education alone, without any additional preventive measures, will effectively reduce the occurrence of ulcers and amputations.
