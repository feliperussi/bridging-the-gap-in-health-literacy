Women can experience high levels of anxiety at all stages of screening for cervical cancer including colposcopy 
Women can experience high levels of anxiety at all stages of screening for cervical cancer including colposcopy (visualisation of the cervix by using a binocular microscope). Colposcopy has been shown to be associated with high levels of anxiety, even higher than anxiety levels in women before surgery and similar to the anxiety levels in women following an abnormal screening test for fetal abnormalities. High levels of anxiety before and during colposcopy can have psychological consequences including pain, discomfort and failure to return for follow‚Äêup. This review examined interventions aimed at reducing such anxiety. Anxiety associated with colposcopic examination appears to be reduced by a variety of interventions including playing music during colposcopy, and viewing the procedure on a TV monitor (video colposcopy).
