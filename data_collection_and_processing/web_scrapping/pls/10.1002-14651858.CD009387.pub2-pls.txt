Exercise for people with increased cardiovascular risk
Individuals with more than one cardiovascular risk factor, such as hypertension, high cholesterol, or smoking, are more likely to present with cardiovascular disease. While exercise has been proven to be effective in controlling individual risk factors, the evidence for its effect on multiple risks remains uncertain. We included four studies, with 823 participants in total, comparing exercise for increased‐risk individuals against control or no treatment. Follow‐up of patients ranged from 16 weeks to six months. No study assessed cardiovascular or all‐cause mortality, or cardiovascular events as individual outcomes. One or more of the studies reported on total cardiovascular risk, low‐density lipoprotein (LDL) and high‐density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, blood pressure, body mass index, exercise capacity, and health‐related quality of life, but the results did not provide conclusive evidence of the effects of exercise in this population. The included studies did not assess smoking cessation or any adverse effects of the exercise intervention. We conclude that the evidence to date is entirely limited to small studies in terms of sample size, short‐term follow‐up, and high‐risk of methodological bias, which makes it difficult to derive any conclusions on the efficacy or safety of the exercise carried out in the included trials on total cardiovascular risk, mortality, or cardiovascular events. It is necessary to conduct high‐quality clinical trials that evaluate the effect of exercise on people with increased cardiovascular risk.
