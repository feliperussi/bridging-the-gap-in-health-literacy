Comparision of key hole surgery and conventional surgery in the management of small bowel Crohn's disease. 
This review finds that laparoscopic surgery for small bowel Crohn's disease may be as safe as conventional surgery. There is no significant difference in the perioperative outcomes and long‚Äêterm disease recurrence rates. However, there are only two RCTs (including 120 patients) so far and no reliable conclusions can be made regarding the benefits of laparoscopic surgery.
