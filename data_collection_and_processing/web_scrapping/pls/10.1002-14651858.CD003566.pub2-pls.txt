Are cardioselective beta‐blockers a safe and effective treatment in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease? 
Long term treatment with beta‐blocker medication reduces the risk of death in patients with high blood pressure, heart failure and coronary artery disease. But patients who have both COPD and cardiovascular disease sometimes do not receive these medicines because of fears that they may worsen the airways disease. This review of data from 22 randomised controlled trials on the use of cardioselective (heart‐specific) beta‐blockers in patients with COPD demonstrated no adverse effect on lung function or respiratory symptoms compared to placebo. This finding was consistent whether patients had severe chronic airways obstruction or a reversible obstructive component. In conclusion, cardioselective beta‐blockers should not be withheld from patients with COPD.
