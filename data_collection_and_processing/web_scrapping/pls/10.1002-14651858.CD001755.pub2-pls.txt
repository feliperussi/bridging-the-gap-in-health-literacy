Anterior vaginal repair for urinary incontinence in women
Urinary incontinence is the inability to prevent urine leakage. Stress urinary incontinence is loss of urine when a person coughs or exercises. A significant amount of a woman's or her families income can be spent on management of stress urinary incontinence. Damage to the muscles that hold up the bladder, and injuries to the nerves during childbirth, may be causes. When non‐surgical methods, such as exercising the muscles in the pelvic floor (the base of the abdomen), have not worked, surgery is sometimes used to lift and support the bladder. Anterior vaginal repair aims to achieve this, operating through the vaginal wall. The review of 10 trials in 1012 women found some evidence that surgery through the abdomen may be better than vaginal repair. However, there was not enough information about side‐effects, or in comparison with other physical or surgical methods of treating urine leakage.
