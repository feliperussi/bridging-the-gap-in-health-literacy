Prevention of thrombosis in children with cancer and tunnelled CVCs
Children with cancer are at higher risk of thrombosis than children without cancer. This is a result of the disease itself but also of the cancer treatment and the presence of a central venous catheter. In this review, we investigated whether systemic treatments can prevent thrombosis. We identified six studies; two studies investigated low molecular weight heparins, one antithrombin supplementation and one cryoprecipitate and/or fresh frozen plasma supplementation; one study compared antithrombin supplementation with low molecular weight heparin and antithrombin supplementation, and another investigated warfarin. The addition of low molecular weight heparins to antithrombin supplementation did result in a lower number of symptomatic thromboses. This was statistically significant. We could not detect an effect of systemic preventive treatments in comparison with no treatment, and no difference was noted in the number of participants who suffered from major or minor bleeding. However, the overall number of participants was very small; a similar study with a larger population of participants might yield different results.
