Oral nonsteroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) for neuropathic pain in adults
Neuropathic pain is pain which comes from damaged nerves, spinal cord, or brain. It is different from pain messages that are carried along healthy nerves from damaged tissue (for example, a fall or cut, or arthritic knee). Neuropathic pain is treated by different medicines to those used for pain from damaged tissue. Medicines that are sometimes used to treat depression or epilepsy can be very effective in some people with neuropathic pain. 
Commonly used painkillers such as ibuprofen (a nonsteroidal anti‐inflammatory drug, or NSAID) are not usually considered to be effective in treating neuropathic pain, but in some parts of the world they are used commonly for neuropathic pain conditions. 
In May 2015 we searched for clinical trials in which oral NSAIDs were used to treat neuropathic pain in adults. We found only two small studies that included 251 participants who had chronic low back pain with a neuropathic component, or had neuropathic pain after shingles. Of these 251 participants, 209 were in a study of an experimental drug that is not licensed and not available for use. 
The trial results show that there was no difference between NSAIDs and placebo in terms of pain or adverse events (very low quality evidence). There is no good evidence to tell us whether or not oral NSAIDs are helpful to treat neuropathic pain conditions.
