Pharmacological treatment for aphasia following stroke
Drug therapy might improve recovery from loss of language function (aphasia) after stroke, but no drug has yet been proven to do more good than harm. Aphasia is a common problem after stroke. Speech and language therapy (SLT) from a speech and language therapist is the most common treatment for this disorder. A number of drugs have been used to try and improve language recovery. This review of 10 studies evaluated six different drugs. The only drug for which there was any evidence of benefit was piracetam, but the evidence of benefit was weak and there were concerns about its safety. It was not possible to conclude whether piracetam was more effective than speech and language therapy in treating aphasia after stroke. More research is needed into the effects of piracetam on aphasia, and its safety, before it can be recommended for routine use.
