Continuous infusion of loop diuretics are safer and more effective than intermittent administration for people with congestive heart failure 
Congestive heart failure (CHF) is reduced ability of the heart to pump blood around the body. The body tries to compensate by retaining water to increase blood volume, but this further weakens the heart. Diuretic drugs reduce water in the body. Loop diuretics work on the deep part of the small kidney tubes. They are commonly used in repeated doses intravenously for CHF, but this can cause rapid fluid shifts and adverse effects. The review of trials found that continuous infusion of loop diuretics for people with CHF is more effective and has fewer adverse effects than intermittent doses.
