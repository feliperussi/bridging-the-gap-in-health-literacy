Light treatment for non‐seasonal depression
The reviewers conclude that the benefit of light treatment is modest though promising for non‐seasonal depression. The short‐term treatment as well as light administered in the morning and with concomitant sleep deprivation in sleep deprivation responders appear to be most beneficial for treatment response. Hypomania as a potential adverse effect needs to be considered. Due to limited data and heterogeneity of studies these results need to be interpreted with caution.
