The use of methotrexate, an immunomodulator drug, for treating people with multiple sclerosis 
Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an immune disease of the nervous system. Drugs that interfere with the immune system, such as methotrexate could benefit people with the disease. To date research suggest that there may be small improvements from treatment with methotrexate. However, until these improvements need to be balanced against methotrexate's potentially serious side‐effects. Until larger research studies are performed, it will be too early to say whether the benefits of this drug outweigh its side‐effects.
