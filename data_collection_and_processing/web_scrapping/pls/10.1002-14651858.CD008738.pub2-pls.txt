Antibiotics to prevent burn wounds becoming infected
Burn injuries are a serious problem. They are associated with a significant incidence of death and disability, multiple surgical procedures, prolonged hospitalisation, and high costs of health care. 
Various antibiotics are used with the aim of reducing the risk of infection in burn patients before it occurs. Some antibiotics are used locally on the skin (topical treatments), others are taken orally, or by injection, and affect the whole body (systemic treatments). It is not clear if prophylactic antibiotics are beneficial. 
Thirty six studies involving 2117 participants are included in this review. The studies compared people with burns who were given antibiotics with people also with burns who received either an inactive treatment (placebo), no treatment, wound dressings, or another topical preparation or antibiotic. Twenty‚Äêsix trials (72%) evaluated topical antibiotics and smaller numbers evaluated antibiotics given orally, intravenously or via the airway. Most studies were small and of poor quality. 
There was some evidence that a particular antibiotic (silver sulfadiazine) applied directly to the burn actually increases the rates of infection by between 8% and 80%. Otherwise there was not enough research evidence about the effects of antibiotics to enable reliable conclusions to be drawn.
