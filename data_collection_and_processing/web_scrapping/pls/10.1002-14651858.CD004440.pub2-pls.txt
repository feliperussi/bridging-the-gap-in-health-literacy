Recombinant growth hormone for idiopathic short stature in children and adolescents
There is some evidence that recombinant human growth hormone improves short term growth and (near) final adult height in children with idiopathic short stature. 
Idiopathic short stature is the term used when children are very short compared with others of their age for unknown or hereditary reasons. They do not have a disease. Recombinant human growth hormone has been used to try to overcome growth failure in these children. It must be injected under the skin six to seven times a week until adult height is reached. Existing evidence suggests that growth hormone can increase short term growth and improve final or near final adult height.  Ten studies included altogether 741 children and lasted between six months and 6.2 years. Results showed that individuals treated with growth hormone remain relatively short when compared with peers of normal stature. Girls treated with growth hormone were 7.5 cm taller than untreated controls (growth hormone treated group 155.3 cm and control group 147.8 cm); another trial found that children treated with growth hormone were 3.7 cm taller than children in a placebo‚Äêtreated group. No serious adverse effects were reported in the included studies. Although serious adverse effects (there has been concern that growth hormone would induce new tumours or increase the likelihood of tumour relapse) may be rare, their possibility must also be taken into consideration.
