Clinical symptoms, signs and tests for identification of impending and current water‐loss dehydration in older people 
Water‐loss dehydration results from drinking too little fluid. It is common in older people and associated with increased risk of many health problems. We wanted to find out whether simple tests (like skin turgor, dry mouth, urine colour and bioelectrical impedance) can usefully tell us whether an older person (aged at least 65 years) is drinking enough. Within the review we assessed 67 different tests, but no tests were consistently useful in telling us whether older people are drinking enough, or are dehydrated. Some tests did appear useful in some studies, and these promising tests should be re‐checked to see whether they are useful in specific older populations. There was sufficient evidence to suggest that some tests should not be used to indicate dehydration. Tests that should not be used include dry mouth, feeling thirsty, heart rate, urine colour, and urine volume.
