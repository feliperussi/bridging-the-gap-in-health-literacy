Focal laser treatment in addition to chemotherapy for retinoblastoma
What was the aim of this review?  The aim of this Cochrane Review was to find out if focal laser therapy in addition to treatment by systemic chemotherapy for retinoblastoma reduces the risk of tumour recurrence. 
Key messages  There were no data comparing systemic chemotherapy alone to systemic chemotherapy with laser therapy. 
What was studied in the review?  Retinoblastoma is the most common primary cancer in children to arise from within the eye. Treatments for retinoblastoma have evolved significantly throughout the years from eye removal (i.e. enucleation); to radiotherapy and, currently, the main treatment used is chemotherapy. The addition of laser therapy at the same time as, or immediately after, chemotherapy is administered may improve tumour control. 
What are the main results of the review?  The review authors did not find any completed studies that could be included in this review. 
How up‐to‐date is this review?  The review authors searched for studies published up to 20 October 2016.
