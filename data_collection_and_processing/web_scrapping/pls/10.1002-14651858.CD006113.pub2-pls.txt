Intravesical treatments for painful bladder syndrome/interstitial cystitis(PBS/IC).
Interstitial cystitis is also known as painful bladder syndrome. It typically causes symptoms of bladder and pelvic pain, an increased urge to pass urine and excessive urination during both day and night. The cause of the condition is not well‐understood but it is thought to result from long‐standing inflammation of the bladder. Many treatments have been used for PBS/IC and in this review we assess the effects of putting medication directly into the bladder (bladder instillations) to treat it. 
We found nine studies that addressed this question, assessing six different types of treatment and involving 616 participants. For none of the instillations was the evidence conclusive. It was most promising for BCG (a type of tuberculosis bacterium) and possibly also for oxybutinin (a drug commonly taken orally to stop unwanted bladder contractions). Another agent, Resiniferatoixin, seemed to worsen pain and increase the likelihood of patients stopping treatment early. Little evidence was found for assessing benefits and harms of other treatments instilled into the bladder.
