Digoxin for preventing or treating neonatal respiratory distress syndrome
There is no evidence that the administration of digoxin helps babies with neonatal respiratory distress syndrome.  Sometimes a newborn baby has lungs that are not expanded properly. This is most common in preterm babies (born before 34 weeks) and is known as respiratory distress syndrome (RDS). Congestive heart failure may lead to fluid accumulation in the lungs, contributing to RDS. The drug digoxin has been used for congestive heart failure and has been suggested for RDS. The review found no evidence from trials that digoxin reduces congestive heart failure, prevents RDS or improves the outcome of preterm babies with RDS.
