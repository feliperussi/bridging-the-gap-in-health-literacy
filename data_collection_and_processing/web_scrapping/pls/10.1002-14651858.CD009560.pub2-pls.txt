Chinese herbal medicines for hypertriglyceridaemia
Hypertriglyceridaemia is a condition characterised by increased blood levels of triglycerides, which constitute one of the blood lipid components. Hypertriglycerideamia can be divided into primary and secondary types. Hypertriglyceridaemia is associated with many diseases including atherosclerosis, diabetes and hypertension. 
To evaluate the effects of various herbal formulations (including single herbs, Chinese proprietary medicines, and mixtures of different herbs) for treating hypertriglyceridaemia, we examined all available randomised controlled trials of Chinese herbal medicines. We identified three studies lasting from four to six weeks and recruiting 170 participants with hypertriglyceridaemia. There were no data on death from any cause, cardiovascular or cerebrovascular events (such as heart attacks or strokes), health‐related quality of life, or costs. 
We found that Chinese herbal medicines used alone or in combination with lipid‐lowering drugs or 'life style' changes may have positive effects on reducing the blood levels of triglycerides. No relevant differences in adverse effects occurred and no serious adverse events were noted. 
On the basis of the current evidence, no definite conclusion is possible especially because of the unclear risk of bias in the included studies and lack of reporting on patient‐important long‐term outcomes.
