Orthotic devices for the treatment of tennis elbow
Lateral epicondylitis (tennis elbow) is a frequently reported condition. A wide variety of treatment strategies has been described. As of yet, no optimal strategy has been identified. 
Five RCTs (N per group 7‐49) were included. Validity score ranged from 3‐9 positive items out of 11. Subgroup analyses were not performed due to the small number of trials. The limited number of included trials present few outcome measures and limited long‐term results. Pooling was not possible due to large heterogeneity amongst trials. 
No definitive conclusions can be drawn concerning effectiveness of orthotic devices for lateral epicondylitis. More well‐designed and well‐conducted RCTs of sufficient power are warranted.
