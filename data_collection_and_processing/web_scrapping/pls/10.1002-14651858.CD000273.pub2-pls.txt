Caffeine versus theophylline for apnea in preterm infants 
There is some evidence that caffeine is as effective as theophylline in the short‐term for reducing apnea in premature babies, is better tolerated and is easier to give. 
Apnea is a pause in breathing of greater than 20 seconds. It may occur repeatedly in preterm babies (born before 34 weeks gestation). Persistent apnea may be harmful to the developing brain or organs. Methylxanthines (such as theophylline and caffeine) are drugs that are believed to stimulate breathing efforts and have been used to reduce apnea. This review of trials found that caffeine has similar effects to theophylline but has a larger gap between levels that are therapeutic and those with toxic effects. Caffeine is more easily absorbed and has a longer half‐life that allows for once daily dosing.
