Strict control compared with conventional glycaemic control for preventing surgical site infections in adults 
Wound‚Äêrelated infections that complicate operations ("surgical site infections") result in worse patient outcomes. Previous studies have suggested that decreasing blood glucose levels to within a low, narrow range (strict control) around the time of surgery may decrease infections and improve outcome. However, concerns about side effects from low glucose levels, such as seizures and increased risk of death, have prevented widespread use of this strategy. There are only five trials comparing strict control strategies with the conventional strategy of treating blood glucose levels only when they become high. These trials differ significantly in patient characteristics, glucose targets, medications and methods used to lower glucose levels, as well as the outcomes measured. Furthermore, the individual studies, which are small and/or flawed, do not demonstrate a significant decrease in surgical site infections. There are insufficient data to support the routine adoption of strict blood glucose control around the time of operation to prevent surgical site infections.
