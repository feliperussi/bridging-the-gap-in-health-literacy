Progestogens with or without oestrogen for irregular menstrual bleeding
Irregular bleeding associated with infrequent or no ovulation occurs most commonly in adolescents and in women approaching the menopause. It may also occur in those with polycystic ovary syndrome. This irregular bleeding may also be heavy. Hormonal treatments are commonly given to these women, but there is insufficient evidence to recommend whether progestogens alone or progestogens in combination with oestrogen are most effective for irregular uterine bleeding associated with infrequent or no ovulation.
