Vancomycin for prophylaxis against sepsis in preterm neonates
Premature babies have immature immune systems and frequently pick up harmful infections in the hospital. This means they are at high risk of sepsis (life‚Äêthreatening bacterial infection). The most common bacteria causing sepsis in neonatal intensive care are coagulase negative staphylococci (CoNS). One way of trying to prevent CoNS infection is by infusing low doses of the antibiotic vancomycin (giving the drug by intermittent infusion or continuous drip). The review of trials found that low dose continuous infusions, or low dose intermittent administration, of vancomycin reduce the risk of a baby getting sepsis in the neonatal intensive care unit. There is not enough evidence to show if this approach increases antibiotic resistance in nurseries.
