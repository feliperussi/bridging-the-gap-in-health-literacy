Long‐acting beta2‐agonists versus theophylline for maintenance treatment of asthma
This review compared three asthma medications, salmeterol, formoterol (both long acting beta‐agonists) and theophylline. These medications are used to help control symptoms of asthma, especially those which occur during the night. This review found that salmeterol showed a greater improvement in lung function, and reduced the need for extra short‐term inhalers in the day and the night. Salmeterol and formoterol are less likely to produce side‐effects (such as headaches and nausea) when compared to theophylline.
