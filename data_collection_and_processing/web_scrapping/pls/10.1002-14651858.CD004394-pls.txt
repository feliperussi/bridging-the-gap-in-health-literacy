No evidence of the efficacy of vitamin B12 supplementation for cognitive function
Vitamin B12 is essential for maintaining normal function of the nervous system, but the relationship between vitamin B12 and cognitive function is not fully understood. From the three studies involving people with dementia or cognitive impairment and low blood levels of vitamin B12 eligible for inclusion in this review there was no statistically significant effect of vitamin B12 supplementation on cognition. The variety of measurement scales used to assess outcomes and uncertainty about diagnostic criteria for vitamin B12 deficiency create difficulties in pooling the results of trials.
