Eversion versus conventional carotid endarterectomy for preventing stroke
There is not enough evidence to decide the best way to do the operation of carotid endarterectomy (CEA) to prevent stroke. The carotid artery is one of the main arteries in the neck supplying blood to the brain. A blockage in the artery can cause a stroke (a sudden catastrophe in the brain either because an artery to the brain blocks, or because an artery in or on the brain ruptures and bleeds). CEA involves two different methods to clear the artery. This is done by either eversion (oblique division of the internal carotid artery at its origin, removing the blockage through this access and reimplantation (re‚Äêjoining) of the vessel at the same original level) or conventional CEA (longitudinal opening of the artery followed by removal of the blockage and suture with or without an enlargement patch). The review found that there was not enough evidence to show either the benefits or adverse effects of these two methods. Eversion CEA may lower the risk of restenosis (renarrowing) of the artery but more research is needed.
