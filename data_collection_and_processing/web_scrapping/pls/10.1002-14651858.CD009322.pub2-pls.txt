Follow‐up of precancerous conditions of the stomach to prevent cancer development
We tried to see if there was enough evidence to support the idea of following up patients with precancerous conditions of the stomach to prevent cancer. This would usually be done by means of an examination of the patient's stomach with a camera inserted via the mouth (an endoscopy) and the removal of small samples of tissue from the stomach (biopsy). An alternative means of follow‐up would be by a blood test measuring for a chemical called pepsinogen, although this is somewhat less accurate or reliable for diagnosis of stomach cancer. This is known as biochemical surveillance. We searched biomedical literature databases and abstracts of conference proceedings for details of any clinical trials. We found that there was no suitable evidence from randomised controlled trials to prove this, but that some studies that have been carried out would support looking into it more closely.
