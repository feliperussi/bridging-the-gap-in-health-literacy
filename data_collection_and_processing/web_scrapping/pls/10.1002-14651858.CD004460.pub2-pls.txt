Capsaicin for allergic rhinitis
Allergic rhinitis is a common health problem affecting between 10% and 25% of the population, and its prevalence is increasing. The symptoms include a running or blocked nose, itching and sneezing. Several drug therapies are available including antihistamines and steroids. Capsaicin, which is the pungent component of hot pepper, has also been used. With repeated doses applied topically it may desensitize the lining of the nose and have a therapeutic effect on allergic rhinitis. The review found one small, low quality randomized controlled trial which did not demonstrate a therapeutic effect of capsaicin on allergic rhinitis symptoms. Further trials are needed.
