No evidence to assess surgical treatment in asymptomatic gallstones
Cholecystectomy is currently advised only for symptomatic gallstones. However, about 4% of patients with asymptomatic gallstones develop symptoms including cholecystitis, obstructive jaundice, pancreatitis, and gallbladder cancer. Literature search was performed for evidence from randomised clinical trials to find whether cholecystectomy was indicated in patients with silent (asymptomatic) gallstones. There is no randomised trial comparing cholecystectomy versus no cholecystectomy in silent gallstones. Further evaluation of observational studies, which measure outcomes such as obstructive jaundice, gallstone‐associated pancreatitis, and/or gall‐bladder cancer for sufficient duration of follow‐up is necessary before randomised trials are designed in order to evaluate whether cholecystectomy or no cholecystectomy is better for asymptomatic gallstones.
