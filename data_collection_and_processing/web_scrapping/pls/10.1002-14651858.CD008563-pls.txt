Prevention of diarrhoea in children with HIV infection or who were born to an HIV‐infected mother 
Diarrhoea is a common cause of illness in children, especially in low and middle‐income countries where it accounts for nearly 2.5 million deaths per year. Infants and children with HIV infection or maternal exposure through birth or breastfeeding to HIV infection may be more vulnerable to diarrhoea due to weakened immune systems, nutritional deficiencies or from having other infections. This review evaluated three interventions to assess whether they can prevent death or illness from diarrhoea in infants and children with HIV infection or exposure: vitamin A, zinc and cotrimoxazole. Vitamin A and zinc may correct micronutrient deficiencies that are prevalent in children with HIV infection or exposure, as well as prevent other infections. Cotrimoxazole is an antibiotic that helps prevent opportunistic infections in immunocompromised hosts, and may also prevent other infections. This review found nine studies that addressed these interventions in infants or children with HIV infection. 
The review indicated that vitamin A shows reduction of mortality and morbidity due to diarrhoea in children with HIV infection and a trend in lower illness from diarrhoea. Zinc prevented visits due to watery diarrhoea and cotrimoxazole decreased death and respiratory infections. 
Other outcomes were variable or did not reach significance. More research in this area would help clarify how these interventions impact illness from diarrhoea in children with HIV infection or exposure.
