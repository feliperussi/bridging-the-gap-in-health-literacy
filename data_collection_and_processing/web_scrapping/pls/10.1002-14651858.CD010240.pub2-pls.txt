Tamoxifen or letrozole versus standard methods for women with breast cancer who freeze egg cells or embryos 
Background 
Breast cancer treatment can cause infertility. Freezing egg cells (oocytes) or embryos before treatment can increase the chances of future motherhood. Hormonal treatment is required before freezing of oocytes or embryos. In cases of hormone‐sensitive breast cancer, this hormonal treatment can theoretically be harmful. Therefore, these women may receive tamoxifen or letrozole in addition to standard hormonal treatment. Cochrane review authors examined the evidence about tamoxifen or letrozole versus standard methods for women with estrogen‐receptor positive breast cancer undergoing freezing of oocytes or embryos in assisted reproduction. 
Key results 
No randomised studies were found in which the different types of treatment available for these women were compared. The evidence is current to October 2013.
