Written and verbal information, compared to verbal information only, for people being discharged from hospital 
When children are discharged from hospital, parents' understanding of how to continue care at home is better if they receive both written and verbal information. 
When people are discharged from hospital, they and/or their carers are given information on how to manage care effectively at home. Hospital staff usually explain what is required verbally and may also give written, or even video‚Äêtaped, information. The review of hospital discharge information found only studies looking at parents caring for their children. Parents had a better understanding of the care needed when given both written and verbal instructions, rather than verbal instructions alone. Further research is needed to determine if this leads to better health outcomes and faster recovery times, and on discharge information for other hospital patients.
