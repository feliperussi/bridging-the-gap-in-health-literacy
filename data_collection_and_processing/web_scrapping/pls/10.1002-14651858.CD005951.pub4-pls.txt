Treatments to help blood clotting to improve the recovery of adults with stroke due to bleeding in the brain 
Review question 
Do treatments to help blood clot reduce the risk of death and disability for adults with stroke due to bleeding in the brain? 
Background 
More than one‐tenth of all strokes are caused by bleeding in the brain (known as brain haemorrhage). The bigger the haemorrhage, the more likely it is to be fatal. Roughly one‐third of brain haemorrhages enlarge significantly within the first 24 hours. Therefore, treatments that promote blood clotting might reduce the risk of death or being disabled after brain haemorrhage by limiting its growth, if given soon after the bleeding starts. However, haemostatic drugs might cause unwanted clotting, leading to unwanted side effects, such as heart attacks and clots in leg veins. 
Study characteristics 
We found 12 randomised controlled trials, including 1732 participants, up to November 2017. 
Key results 
We found moderate‐quality evidence of harm from platelet transfusion for people who had used antiplatelet drugs until they had a brain haemorrhage. We found no evidence of either benefit or harm from other haemostatic therapies for people with brain haemorrhage. 
Quality of the evidence 
Overall, the quality of the evidence was moderate to low.
More information will become available from the 10 trials that are ongoing.
