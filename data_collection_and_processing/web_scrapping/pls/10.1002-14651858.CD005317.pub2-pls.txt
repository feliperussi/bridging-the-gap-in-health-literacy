No convincing evidence from one trial of the efficacy of cholinesterase inhibitors for delirium 
Delirium is a confusional state that is associated with physical illness. Its characteristic features are rapid onset, altered consciousness, reduced attention and global cognitive impairment. Other symptoms are hallucinations (particularly visual hallucinations), disturbed sleep pattern and agitation. Delirium is commonly found in hospital patients and is associated with longer admissions, poor functioning level, persistent cognitive impairment and need for institutional care. Delirium is therefore an important syndrome to recognise and treat. The one included trial, of donepezil compared with placebo in 15 patients, showed no statistically significant difference in length of delirium. No other outcomes were measured.
