Breathing muscle training for people with bronchiectasis
A search for controlled trials of physical training in bronchiectasis only identified one full text publication which contains data from the 2 earlier abstracts, including 43 patients in total. These suggest some benefits of inspiratory muscle training on exercise capacity, quality of life and respiratory muscle function at eight weeks, but further research is needed to confirm these findings in larger numbers of people with bronchiectasis. Further research is also needed to assess the benefit of other types of physical training and pulmonary rehabilitation in bronchiectasis.
