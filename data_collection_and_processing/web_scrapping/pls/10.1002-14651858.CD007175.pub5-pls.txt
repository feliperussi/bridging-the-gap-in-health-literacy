Antibiotics for treating osteomyelitis in people with sickle cell disease
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence to determine whether antibiotics (alone or in combination) given to people with sickle cell disease who have osteomyelitis (a bone infection) before the specific bacterium causing an infection is known is effective and safe as compared to bacterium‚Äêdirected antibiotic treatment and whether this effectiveness and safety is dependent on different treatment regimens, age or setting. This is an update of a previously published Cochrane Review. 
Background 
Sickle cell disease affects millions of people throughout the world. Osteomyelitis is one of the major complications. Antibiotics are given to treat it, but there is no worldwide standard treatment. 
Search date 
The evidence is current to: 18 September 2019.
Study characteristics 
There are no trials included in this review.
Key results 
We conclude that a randomised controlled trial should attempt to answer these questions, however, we do not envisage further trials of this intervention will be conducted, and hence the review will no longer be regularly updated.
