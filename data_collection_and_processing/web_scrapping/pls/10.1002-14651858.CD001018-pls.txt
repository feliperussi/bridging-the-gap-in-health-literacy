Hormone replacement therapy has no effect on body weight and cannot prevent weight gain at menopause. 
Hormone replacement therapy (HRT) is used to reduce the symptoms of menopause and bone loss after menopause. Some women decline to take HRT because they believe it causes weight gain. The review of trials found no evidence that unopposed oestrogen and combined oestrogen and progestogen have an effect on body weight additional to that usually gained at the time of menopause. The review did not find any evidence that HRT prevents weight gain experienced at menopause.
