Exercises of the muscles around the anus with or without biofeedback (aids for knowing when the muscles are contracting) for the treatment of faecal incontinence in adults 
Faecal incontinence (inability to control bowel movements or leaking stool) can be a very embarrassing and socially restricting problem. There are many possible causes, including childbirth damage to the muscles which control bowel movements. Exercises to strengthen these muscles and 'biofeedback', where equipment is used to show people how to use the muscles properly, are often recommended. There was some evidence from trials suggesting that these treatments are helpful. If patients who have tried and failed other simpler treatments, such as changing their diet or using medications, are selected then biofeedback using computer equipment or rectal balloon is more beneficial than exercises alone. Exercises and electrical stimulation used in the anus may be more helpful than vaginal exercises for women with faecal incontinence after childbirth. About half of the 21 trials were at low risk of bias. They compared different combinations of treatments and different outcome measures, making comparison between them difficult. However, a small number of the larger recent trials provide better evidence.
