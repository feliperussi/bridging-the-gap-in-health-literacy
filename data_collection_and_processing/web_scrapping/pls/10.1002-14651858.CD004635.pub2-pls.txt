Long‐term pituitary down‐regulation before in vitro fertilization (IVF) for women with endometriosis 
Endometriosis is a disease characterised by the presence of endometrial tissue (the lining of the womb) outside the cavity of the womb. Many women with the disease suffer from menstrual pain and some suffer from infertility. Infertile women with endometriosis are often treated with in vitro fertilization (IVF) or intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) but have a lower chance of becoming pregnant compared to women who are infertile with blocked tubes. It has been suggested that giving GnRH agonists before IVF or ICSI could increase the chances of pregnancy. We have reviewed the literature and found that treating women for three to six months with GnRH agonists before IVF or ICSI increases the odds of clinical pregnancy four‐fold. However, at present there is no information on the effect of this treatment on the incidence of ectopic pregnancy, multiple pregnancies or complications arising for the women or their offspring.
