Interventions for suspected placenta praevia
There is little evidence about the best care for placenta praevia, although putting a stitch in the cervix during pregnancy may reduce associated preterm birth. 
Placenta praevia is when the placenta (afterbirth) lies across the bottom of the womb. This means that it is lying either totally across the cervix (opening of the womb) or partially so. Placenta praevia can cause life‚Äêthreatening blood loss. There are different ways of diagnosing placenta praevia, and various options for care around birth. However, there are only trials of cervical cerclage ('tying' the cervix), and the effects of hospitalisation. The review found that cervical cerclage may reduce very premature births, although the evidence was not strong. There is little evidence of advantages or disadvantages to hospitalisation.
