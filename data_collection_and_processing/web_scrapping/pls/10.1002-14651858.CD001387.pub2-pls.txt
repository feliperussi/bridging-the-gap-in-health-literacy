Ipratropium bromide versus short acting beta‐2 agonists for stable chronic obstructive pulmonary disease 
This review looks at studies that compare the regular use for at least four weeks of different types of inhaled short‐acting bronchodilator medication in people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD, or emphysema/chronic bronchitis). There were eleven trials included. There were no major differences seen between the responses to ipratropium and salbutamol, or the combination. Where there were benefits, they were small and would not support a general recommendation for the use of ipratropium bromide or a combination with beta‐2 agonist over a beta‐2 agonist alone in COPD. People with COPD could use the short‐acting bronchodilator that gives them the most improvement in their symptoms.
