There is no evidence from randomised controlled trials for or against the use of 'Yizhi capsule' as a treatment for vascular dementia 
Vascular dementia (VD) is a syndrome or diagnosis that has different causes and clinical manifestations relating to several different vascular mechanisms and changes in the brain. It influences a patient's quality of life seriously. 'Yizhi capsule' is believed to be effective in the treatment of vascular dementia for improving cognitive function. The review authors found no randomised placebo controlled trials that considered 'Yizhi capsule' for patients with vascular dementia. High quality, placebo controlled research is needed.
