Calcium channel blockers can reduce the death of tubular cells in the kidney after a transplant operation 
Acute tubular necrosis (ATN) is the sudden death of tubular cells in the kidney. ATN can happen after a kidney transplant if the kidney does not receive enough oxygen. Calcium channel blockers stop calcium ions flowing into the muscle cells of the heart and blood vessels. These blockers cause the muscles to widen and relax, lowering a person's blood pressure and improving their circulation. The review of 13 studies (724 participants) found that giving calcium channel blockers during a kidney transplant operation reduces the chance of ATN after the operation. The effect of giving the blockers after the operation still needs to be investigated.
