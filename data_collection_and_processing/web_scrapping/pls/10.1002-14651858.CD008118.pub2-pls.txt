Fermented milk for hypertension
High blood pressure is a major health problem as it is one of the main risk factors for cardiovascular disease. Fermented milk has been suggested to reduce blood pressure in humans. This review was conducted to establish whether the intake of fermented milk lowers blood pressure in humans. In 15 studies including 1232 participants a very modest lowering of systolic blood pressure was found, but no effect on diastolic blood pressure was present. The included studies were of a variable quality and the findings do not support the use of fermented milk as antihypertensive treatment or as a lifestyle intervention to reduce blood pressure.
