Multi‐media social marketing campaigns to increase HIV testing uptake among men who have sex with men and transgender women 
Men who have sex with men and transgender women are disproportionately affected by HIV/AIDS worldwide. Unrecognized infections could be one of the driving forces of ongoing HIV transmission among these populations. Thus, it is important to promote HIV testing. 
Limited evidence suggests that multi‐media social marketing campaigns can significantly increase HIV testing uptake among men who have sex with men. Future research should employ more rigorous designs in evaluating social marketing interventions, measure their long‐term impact, and identify intervention components that are most effective in reaching the target population and changing behaviours.
