Catheter policies for management of long‚Äêterm voiding problems in adults with nerve damage affecting the bladder 
People with nerve damage affecting the bladder may have incontinence (leakage of urine) or an inability to empty the bladder (voiding problem). This may cause infections or damage to the kidneys. Treatments include a permanent urinary catheter; using a catheter intermittently whenever the bladder needs to be emptied; an external sheath catheter fitted to the penis; or timed voiding, which involves regular emptying of the bladder at timed intervals. Although all these methods are used in practice, the review found that no randomised trials have been conducted to provide good evidence to suggest which is best and in which circumstances.
