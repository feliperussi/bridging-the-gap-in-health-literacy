Not enough evidence to tell what type of non‐surgical treatment is best for treating a broken wrist 
In older women, a broken wrist (from a fracture at the lower end of one of the two forearm bones) can result from a fall onto an outstretched hand. Treatment is usually non‐surgical and may include putting the broken bone back into position and immobilising the wrist in a plaster or brace. There was not enough evidence from trials to determine whether, and if so when, moderately displaced fractures should be manipulated back into position. Nor was there enough evidence to determine the best method and duration of immobilisation.
