Heparins and some mechanical pumping devices may help prevent blood clots forming in the legs after surgery for hip fracture 
Patients with hip fracture may develop blood clots (thrombosis) in their legs. Some of these blood clots may travel to the lungs and cause a blockage (embolism), which can be fatal. Various drugs and physical devices are sometimes used to try and prevent these complications. This review of randomised trials found that both heparins and mechanical pumping devices significantly decrease the incidence of deep vein thrombosis. There was not enough evidence to conclude about the effect on lung (pulmonary) embolism, mortality or possible side effects for either heparin or mechanical methods.
