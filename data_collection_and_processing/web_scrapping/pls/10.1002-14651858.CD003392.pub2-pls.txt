Breast stimulation for cervical ripening and induction of labour
Breast stimulation appears beneficial in relation to the number of women not in labour after 72 hours, and reduced postpartum haemorrhage rates. 
Breast stimulation causes the womb to contract, though the mechanism remains unclear. It may increase levels of the hormone oxytocin, which stimulates contractions. It is a non‐medical method allowing the woman greater control over the process of attempting to induce labour. The review of six trials (719 women) found insufficient research to evaluate the safety of breast stimulation in a high‐risk population and until safety issues have been fully evaluated, it should not be considered for use in this group.
