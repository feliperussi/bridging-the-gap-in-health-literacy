Duration of antibacterial treatment for uncomplicated urinary tract infection in women
Uncomplicated urinary tract infection (UTI) is a common disease occurring frequently in young women. It is caused by bacteria multiplying in urine, and the patient usually complains of urgency and burning pain while urinating. The present practice is to treat the patient with antibiotics for three days. In this review we included all studies that compared three‚Äêday therapy with longer treatment (five days or more). Three days of treatment were adequate to achieve symptomatic relief for most patients, but it appears that longer therapy is better in terms of bacteria elimination from the urine, no matter what antibiotic is used. Longer therapy for UTI is related to higher rate of adverse reactions to the antibiotics used. Pending further research, it could be considered for women in whom eradication of bacteria in the urine is important.
