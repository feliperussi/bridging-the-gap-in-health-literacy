Home versus in‐centre haemodialysis for end‐stage kidney disease
Numerous studies observing people who are treated with haemodialysis at home show they have better quality of life and survival, but such analyses are not randomised (that is, participants treated with home haemodialysis may be younger and have fewer health problems that explain the improvements in outcomes observed). 
Home haemodialysis may also increase burden of treatment for patients and families and risks complications associated with dialysis vascular access. 
We investigated whether home haemodialysis improves clinical outcomes compared with haemodialysis treatment in a hospital or clinic setting (in‐centre haemodialysis) when participants are randomly assigned to different treatment settings. 
We found that only one study that involved nine patients had compared home haemodialysis with in‐centre haemodialysis. There was insufficient information to understand the effects of home haemodialysis on survival or need for hospital admission in this study. Home haemodialysis may improve blood pressure and physical symptoms, but may increase the burden of care for families and patients. Given the potential benefits of home haemodialysis in non‐randomised studies, larger randomised trials of home haemodialysis could help inform clinical care and policy.
