Adrenaline for the emergency treatment of anaphylaxis
Anaphylaxis is a serious allergic reaction that is rapid in onset and may cause death. It is commonly triggered by a food, insect sting, medication, or natural rubber latex. The reaction occurs without warning and can be a frightening experience for those at risk and for their families and friends. Adrenaline (epinephrine) is widely advocated as the main treatment in those individuals experiencing anaphylaxis. There is no other medication with a similar effect on the many body systems that are potentially involved in anaphylaxis. The evidence base in support of the use of adrenaline is unclear. We therefore conducted a systematic review of the literature searching key databases for high quality published and unpublished material on the use of adrenaline for emergency treatment; in addition, we contacted experts in this area and the relevant pharmaceutical companies. Our searches retrieved no randomized controlled trials on this subject. We concluded that the use of adrenaline in anaphylaxis is based on tradition and on evidence from fatality series in which most individuals dying from anaphylaxis had not received prompt adrenaline treatment. Adrenaline appears to be life saving when injected promptly, however, there is no evidence from randomized controlled trials for or against the use of adrenaline in the emergency treatment of anaphylaxis. Given the infrequency of anaphylaxis, its unpredictability and the speed of onset of reactions, conducting such trials is fraught with ethical and methodological difficulties.
