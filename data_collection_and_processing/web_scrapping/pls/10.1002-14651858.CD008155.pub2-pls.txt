Surfactant for bacterial pneumonia in term and late preterm infants
Bacterial pneumonia in preterm and term newborn babies can cause problems with the functioning of pulmonary surfactant, a complex combination of fats and proteins that lines the lung and causes the lung to work effectively. Disrupting surfactant function makes breathing very difficult for these infants. In this review, we did not find any suitable clinical trials to assess the benefits or harms of surfactant treatment in addition to standard intensive care in the treatment of babies with bacterial pneumonia. More research is needed to answer the question of whether surfactant treatment is beneficial for near‚Äêterm and term infants with bacterial pneumonia.
