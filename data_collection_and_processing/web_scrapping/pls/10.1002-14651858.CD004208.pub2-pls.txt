Albumin infusion for low serum albumin in preterm newborn infants
There is a lack of evidence from randomised trials to either support or refute the routine use of albumin infusion for premature babies with a low albumin level. Albumin is a protein that is normally present in the blood. In premature infants, the albumin level in the blood can be low. Albumin is often given to premature babies with a low albumin level. Only two small randomised controlled trials have studied the use of albumin in sick premature babies, and the trials are not big enough or good enough to decide whether giving albumin helps babies in the short or long‚Äêterm. Therefore, the question of whether giving albumin does any good and is safe cannot be answered.
