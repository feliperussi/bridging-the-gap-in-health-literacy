Drains increase the harms to patients undergoing open cholecystectomy
Cholecystectomy is the removal of the gallbladder. It is performed mainly in patients having symptomatic gallstones. Drain usage after open cholecystectomy is controversial. The present review includes 28 trials assessing 20 comparisons of 'no drain' versus 'drain' and 12 comparisons of different drain types. The review reports that drains increase the harms to the patient. Drains do not provide any additional benefit for patients undergoing open cholecystectomy and should be avoided in open cholecystectomy. The review found no significant differences between different drain types.
