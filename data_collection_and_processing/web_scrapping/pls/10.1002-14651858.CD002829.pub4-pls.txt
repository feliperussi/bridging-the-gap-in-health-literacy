Antioxidants for treating amyotrophic lateral sclerosis
There is no cure for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, also known as motor neuron disease, which is a progressively disabling and ultimately fatal disease. Antioxidants, including vitamins C, E, selegiline, selenium, methionineacetylcysteine, and coenzyme Q10, have been suggested as possible treatments and some of these are commonly advised by physicians treating people with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. In this updated review, we identified 10 studies involving a total of 1015 participants. We did not find any well‚Äêdesigned randomized controlled trial evidence to support the use of these medications. Trials of antioxidants identified in this review were generally of poor methodological quality and lacked statistical power. However, antioxidants are generally well tolerated without serious adverse effects.
