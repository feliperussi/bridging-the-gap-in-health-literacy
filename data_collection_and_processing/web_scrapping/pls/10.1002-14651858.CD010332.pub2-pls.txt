Airway suctioning for newborn infants at birth
Review question: Does routine oropharyngeal/nasopharyngeal suctioning of newborn infants' airways compared to no suction have an effect on mortality and morbidity with and without meconium‚Äêstained amniotic fluid? 
Background: The transition from fetus to newborn involves the clearing of lung fluid and expansion of the lungs with air. Traditionally, oro/nasopharyngeal suctioning at birth has been used routinely to remove fluids in vigorous infants at birth. While airway oro/nasopharyngeal suctioning can be successful in clearing the airway immediately after birth, the procedure can have serious consequences that may outweigh the potential benefits of oro/nasopharyngeal suctioning. This review examined the effect of oro/nasopharyngeal suctioning versus no suctioning. 
Study characteristics: Eight randomised controlled trials enrolling 4011 newborn infants met our inclusion criteria. 
Results: The currently available evidence neither supports nor refutes suctioning as a beneficial therapy for healthy term infants and further quality studies are needed in term and preterm newborns.
