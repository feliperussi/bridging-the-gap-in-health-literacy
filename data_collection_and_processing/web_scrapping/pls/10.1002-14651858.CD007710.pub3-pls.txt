Pain relief for hysteroscopy as an outpatient
Review question 
The purpose of this review was to determine which, if any, pain relief drug is effective at reducing the discomfort experienced with outpatient hysteroscopy. 
Background 
Hysteroscopy is a diagnostic test undertaken to identify the cause of abnormal uterine bleeding. Hysteroscopy involves fluid or gas being injected via the cervix into the uterus, enabling the visualisation of the cervical canal and uterine cavity with a hysteroscope, which can be painful. There is disagreement regarding the best form of pain relief during the procedure. 
Study characteristics 
We included 32 randomised controlled trials (RCTs), with 3304 participants, of which only 19 reported data suitable for analysis. 
All studies took place in a clinical setting. The age of the participants ranged from 33 to 61 years. Studies took place in Australia, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, China, France, Greece, India, Italy, Spain, Taiwan, UK, USA. Baseline pain scores in all groups were relatively low. The evidence is current to September 2016. 
Key results 
There was no consistent good‚Äêquality evidence of a clinically meaningful difference in safety or effectiveness between different types of pain relief compared with each other or with placebo or no treatment in women undergoing outpatient hysteroscopy. 
Quality of the evidence 
Most studies were at unclear or high risk of bias in most of the domains assessed. The evidence was low or very low quality, mainly due to risk of bias and imprecision.
