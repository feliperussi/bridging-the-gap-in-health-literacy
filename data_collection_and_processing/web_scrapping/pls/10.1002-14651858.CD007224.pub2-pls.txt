Coronary artery bypass surgery performed with versus without cardiac arrest and cardiopulmonary bypass in patients with ischaemic heart disease 
Patients with ischaemic heart disease due to narrowing of coronary arteries can be treated with coronary artery bypass surgery. Coronary artery bypass surgery has traditionally been performed with cardiopulmonary bypass and an arrested heart. Development of cardiac stabilisers have made it possible to conduct the operation on the beating heart and thereby avoid cardiac arrest and cardiopulmonary bypass. By avoiding cardiac arrest and cardiopulmonary bypass, it was hoped that complications seen after coronary artery bypass could be reduced. Systematic review of 86 randomised clinical trials including 10,716 patients and statistical analyses of the data showed that coronary artery bypass surgery performed on the beating heart results in an increased risk of death. No firm evidence for benefit or harm was found regarding the outcome measures myocardial infarction, stroke, atrial fibrillation, renal insufficiency, or coronary reintervention. Our data raises a warning regarding coronary artery bypass surgery on the beating heart and cardiac arrest and cardiopulmonary bypass seem less risky. In patients with contraindications for cannulation of the aorta and cardiopulmonary bypass coronary artery bypass surgery on the beating heart may be a solution but we need randomised clinical trials in these patients to identify the most beneficial approach.
