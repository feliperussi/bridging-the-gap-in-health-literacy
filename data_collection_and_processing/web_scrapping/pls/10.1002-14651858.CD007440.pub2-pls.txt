Single dose oral diflunisal for acute postoperative pain in adults
This review assessed evidence from nine randomised, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled clinical trials, in which there were 906 adults in comparisons of diflunisal (a non‐steroidal, anti‐inflammatory drug) with placebo for treatment of moderate to severe acute post‐operative pain. It is an effective analgesic over the dose range 250 mg to 1000 mg, with a long duration of action. At 1000 mg, the analgesic effect over 4 to 6 hours is as good as the combination of paracetamol 1000 mg and codeine 60 mg in similar studies using the same methods.
