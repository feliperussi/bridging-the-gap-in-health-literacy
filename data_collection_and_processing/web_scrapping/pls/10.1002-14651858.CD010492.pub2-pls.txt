Chinese herbal medicines for benign thyroid nodules in adults
Review question 
To assess the effects of Chinese herbal medicines in the treatment of benign thyroid nodules in adults. 
Background 
A thyroid nodule is a swelling within the thyroid gland and is a common clinical problem detected in 20% to 70% of people. Thyroid nodules can cause pressure symptoms and cosmetic complaints. Treatment for benign thyroid nodules includes thyroid hormone therapy, surgery, radioiodine treatment, percutaneous ethanol injection therapy and laser or radiofrequency treatment to shrink nodules. Chinese herbal medicines are commonly used as alternatives to drug treatment. 
Study characteristics 
We could identify only one randomised controlled trial involving 152 participants with benign thyroid nodules. The intervention group (98 participants) was treated with a combination of two Chinese herbal medicines, and no treatment was given to the control group (54 participants). The duration of treatment was three months, and overall follow‐up six months. 
Key results 
The included study did not investigate nodule volume reduction ≥ 50%; pressure symptoms, cosmetic complaints or both; health‐related quality of life; all‐cause mortality; cancer occurrence; changes in number and size of thyroid nodules; changes in thyroid volume; or socioeconomic effects. Thyroid hormone levels were normal in both groups before and after the study was conducted. No adverse events were reported. 
Quality of the evidence 
The overall quality of the included study was unclear or low.
Currentness of data 
This evidence is up to date as of April 2013.
