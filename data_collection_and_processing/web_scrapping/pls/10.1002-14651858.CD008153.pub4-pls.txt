Subpial transection surgery for epilepsy
Background 
Nearly 30% of patients with epilepsy continue to have seizures despite taking several antiepileptic drugs (AEDs). Such patients are regarded as having refractory, or uncontrolled, epilepsy, which directly affects the intellectual function and social status of children. It causes considerable morbidity and mortality, affecting the person's quality of life. Some people with refractory epilepsy benefit from surgical treatment. 
Multiple subpial transection (MST) is a surgical technique by which connections of the epileptic focus are partially cut without resection. MST is one type of surgery that can be performed for people with medically refractory epilepsy, for whom the epileptogenic zone cannot be resected because of high risk of neurological deficits. 
Aim of the review 
In this review, we planned to assess benefits and adverse effects of multiple subpial transection in people with refractory epilepsy. 
Results 
We found no randomised controlled trials comparing subpial transection versus antiepileptic drug therapy or another type of epilepsy surgery. 
Conclusions 
There is not enough evidence to know whether subpial transection is effective or safe; additional studies are needed. The evidence is current to August 2018.
