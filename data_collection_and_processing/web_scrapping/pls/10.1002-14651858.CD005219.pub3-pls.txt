Normal pressure oxygen therapy and hyperbaric oxygen therapy for migraine and cluster headaches 
Background 
Migraine and cluster headaches are severe and disabling. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT, that is the breathing of pure oxygen at pressures greater than one atmosphere in a pressurised chamber) and normal pressure oxygen therapy (NBOT) can be delivered via a mask at home or in a clinic. These treatments may help to end acute attacks and prevent future attacks. 
Results 
We originally searched the literature widely in May 2008, and most recently in June 2015. We looked for high quality trials that would help define whether or not there was good evidence for or against the use of oxygen for migraine or cluster headache. We included 11 trials in this review. 
Quality of the evidence 
We found some low quality evidence to suggest that HBOT relieves pain with acute migraine headaches and possibly cluster headaches, and that NBOT may relieve pain with cluster headache. We found no evidence that either treatment can prevent future attacks. Many migraines can be treated simply with appropriate drug therapy, so further research is needed to help choose the most appropriate patients (if any) to receive HBOT.
