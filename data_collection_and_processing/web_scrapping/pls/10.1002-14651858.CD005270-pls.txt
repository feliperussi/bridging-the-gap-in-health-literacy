Long‐term non‐pharmacological weight loss interventions for adults with prediabetes
Persons with blood glucose levels that are abnormal, but not in the range of persons with diabetes, are said to have prediabetes, which often precedes the development of type 2 diabetes. Most persons with prediabetes are overweight and obesity worsens the blood glucose and other problems associated with prediabetes. In this review we found that dietary, physical activity, or behavioral interventions produced significant improvements in weight among persons with prediabetes and a significant decrease in diabetes incidence. Modest, but not statistically significant improvements were noted in the few studies that examined blood sugar control, blood pressure, and lipid levels. No data on quality of life or mortality were found.
