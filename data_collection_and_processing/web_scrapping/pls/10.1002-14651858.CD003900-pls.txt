Anticholinergic bronchodilators versus beta2‐sympathomimetic agents for acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease 
Shortness of breath is the main complaint of persons with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). This symptom worsens during an exacerbation or 'flare' of COPD. Trials comparing ipratropium bromide versus beta‐agonists showed no significant difference in short‐term or long‐term effects (24 hours) on ease of breathing. Side effects of these drugs were reported by only a minority of patients and include dry mouth and tremor, and a 'strange feeling' after drug administration.
