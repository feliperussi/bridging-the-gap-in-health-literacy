Partial agonists for the treatment of high blood pressure.
Background 
Partial agonists are a subclass of beta blockers used for treatment of high blood pressure. Drugs that belong to this class included acebutolol (Sectral), pindolol (Visken) and celiprolol (Cardem). We examined how much this class of drugs lowers blood pressure. 
Study characteristics 
We developed a comprehensive search strategy to search relevant scientific databases for clinical trials and found 13 trials that randomly assigned 605 high blood pressure patients to either fixed‚Äêdose partial agonist treatment or placebo for up to 12 weeks. 
Key results 
On average, partial agonists lowered blood pressure by eight points in systolic and four points in diastolic pressure in patient with moderate to severe high blood pressure. We did not find any evidence showing that doses higher than the recommended starting doses would further lower blood pressure. On average, partial agonists lowered pulse pressure by 4 mmHg. The included studies generally did not report side effects serious enough that lead to termination of treatment. It was not clear whether partial agonists provide more side effects serious enough that lead to withdrawal compared to placebo. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of evidence is very low due to small sample size and high risk of bias.
