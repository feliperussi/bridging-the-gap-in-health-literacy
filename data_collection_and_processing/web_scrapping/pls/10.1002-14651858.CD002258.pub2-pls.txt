Bromocriptine versus levodopa in early Parkinson's disease
Parkinson's disease is a disabling disease characterised by slowness of movement, trembling (tremors) and stiffness. Currently, the best treatment for Parkinson's disease is levodopa. However, with the number of levodopa treatment years, new disabling fluctuations of movement occur. To overcome this problem, bromocriptine has been tried as an alternative drug. The review of six trials (850 participants) found that bromocriptine may be helpful in delaying such fluctuations of movement problems in patients with Parkinson's disease who can tolerate the drug.
