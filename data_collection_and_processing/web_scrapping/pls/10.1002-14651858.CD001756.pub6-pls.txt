Mechanical devices for urinary incontinence in women
Urinary incontinence is involuntary loss of urine. The common types are stress and urge incontinence. Mechanical devices are made of plastic or other materials. They are placed within the urethra or vagina in order to stop or control the leakage of urine. This review of trials found that using mechanical devices might be better than no treatment but the evidence is weak. There was not enough evidence to recommend any specific type of device or to show whether mechanical devices are better than other forms of treatment such as pelvic floor muscle training.
