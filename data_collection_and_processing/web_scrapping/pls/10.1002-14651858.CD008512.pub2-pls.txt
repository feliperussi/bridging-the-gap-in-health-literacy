Interventions for the prevention of postoperative ear discharge after insertion of ventilation tubes (grommets) in children 
The insertion of a grommet is a common surgical procedure performed in children. Ear discharge (otorrhoea) is often complained of after the procedure. A wide range of treatments are used to prevent the discharge, but the evidence for their effectiveness is inconclusive: indeed, it is not known whether treatment is even necessary. 
This review found 15 randomised controlled trials which assessed the effectiveness of the interventions used to prevent ear discharge after surgery. The findings in seven low risk of bias trials (and part of an eighth) showed a reduction in the rate of ear discharge up to two weeks after the operation using either saline washouts or a single application of antibiotics at the time of the operation. A prolonged application of antibiotics was also effective. The effects were largest in studies with a high rate of ear discharge. 
We conclude that the use of an intervention to prevent postoperative ear discharge should be restricted to those at a high risk of this discharge, but the choice of which treatment may be left to the surgeon.
