Protein restriction for children with chronic kidney disease
Low protein diet can delay kidney failure in adults with kidney disease, however a diet low in protein in children raises concern of poor growth. The review identified 2 studies (250 children) in children with kidney disease and found that a low protein diet does not delay progression to kidney failure (end‚Äêstage kidney disease). There remains some concern regarding adverse effect on growth.
