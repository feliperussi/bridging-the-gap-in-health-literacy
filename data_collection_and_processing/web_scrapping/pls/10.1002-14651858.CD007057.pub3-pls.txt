Intravenous immunoglobulin in addition to standard treatments for Wegener's granulomatosis
Wegener's granulomatosis is a rare disorder that causes inflammation of the blood vessels. This inflammation restricts blood flow to various organs which can eventually damage the organs. Organs most affected by Wegener's include the lungs, upper respiratory tract, kidneys, joints, skin and eyes. Wegener's granulomatosis also produces a granuloma (a mass or nodule of inflammatory tissue) which is found around the blood vessels and which can also damage surrounding tissue. The cause of Wegener's granulomatosis is unknown. Treatment is with corticosteroids and cytotoxic drugs which are often used for chemotherapy. Most patients get better with these drugs. However, the disorder returns in approximately half of patients. Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) is an expensive and fairly rare blood product that has been used to treat Wegener's granulomatosis but its effects on the disorder are unknown. We asked if IVIg provided an advantage as an additive to standard treatments. We found one small randomized trial in which 34 participants were randomized to receive IVIg or placebo once daily in addition to azathioprine and prednisolone for remission maintenance. This trial did not provide enough evidence to determine if IVIg has an advantage over corticosteroids and immunosuppressants for the treatment of Wegener's granulomatosis.
