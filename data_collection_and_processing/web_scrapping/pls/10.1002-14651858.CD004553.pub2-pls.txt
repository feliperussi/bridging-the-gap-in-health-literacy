Insufficient data are available on the benefits of the COMT inhibitor tolcapone compared with the dopamine agonists bromocriptine and pergolide in relieving the symptoms of later Parkinson's disease. 
As Parkinson's disease progresses the control of the symptoms often requires the addition of other drugs to levodopa. The principle aim of COMT inhibitor therapy is to increase the duration of effect of each levodopa dose and thus reduce the time patients spend in the relatively immobile 'off' phase. However other drugs such as dopamine agonists can also be used at this stage of the disease. This review found that the COMT inhibitor tolcapone as an adjuvant to levodopa treatment had a similar level of benefits as two dopamine agonists, bromocriptine and pergolide. There was no significant difference in efficacy between the adjuvant tolcapone and adjuvant bromocriptine or pergolide in the medium‐term. Tolcapone produced nausea less often than these agonists but there was some evidence of liver function abnormalities with tolcapone. Post‐marketing surveillance identified three cases of fatal hepatic toxicity in patients treated with tolcapone. As a result, tolcapone has been withdrawn from some countries and severe restrictions on its use have been imposed in others. 
No evidence was found comparing entacapone with other adjuvant drugs for Parkinson's disease.
