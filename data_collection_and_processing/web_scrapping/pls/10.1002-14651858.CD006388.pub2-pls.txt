Octreotide for treatment of chylothorax in newborns
Collection of lymphatic fluid in the chest cavity is called chylothorax. Routine management of this condition involves treatment of the underlying condition, draining of fluid, putting a tube in the chest wall until all the fluid is drained and rarely surgery. Octreotide is a drug that may reduce the production and accumulation of fluid and allow babies to recover faster. No trials have evaluated the safety and efficacy of this drug in babies and only case reports are available. Future studies are needed.
