Supported housing for people with severe mental disorders
Support for people with severe mental illness may be provided through supported housing schemes with the intention of increasing treatment success rates and reducing cycles of hospital readmissions. Many of these initiatives are based on informal reports of effectiveness and they are costly in terms of development, capital investment and on‚Äêgoing care provision. In this review we sought to compare supported housing schemes with outreach support schemes or 'standard care' for people with severe mental disorder/s living in the community. We did not identify any studies from randomised trials in this review. There are a number of supported housing options funded by local authorities as well as charities which may be beneficial but could equally increase levels of dependence on professionals and provide greater exclusion from the community. Whether or not the benefits outweigh the risks are currently only a matter of opinion, debate and informal reports. There is an urgent need to assess the effectiveness of these schemes using well conducted randomised trials.
