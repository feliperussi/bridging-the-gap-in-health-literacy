Gabapentin for acute postoperative pain in adults
Gabapentin is a medicine used primarily to treat epilepsy and also pain caused by damage to nerves (neuropathic pain). Gabapentin is not normally used to treat pain due to injury or pain after an operation; it is debatable whether gabapentin is an effective pain medicine under such circumstances. We aimed to investigate whether gabapentin is effective in the treatment of acute postoperative pain in adults. We identified four unpublished clinical trials with 370 participants who received either gabapentin or placebo (sugar pill). Gabapentin 250 mg does provide some relief in acute postoperative pain but it is not as good as some other medicines commonly used in this setting, particularly ibuprofen, diclofenac, and naproxen, and probably paracetamol (acetaminophen) alone or in combination with a weak opioid. 
However, from a scientific point of view, it is interesting that a medicine originally developed to treat epilepsy has any effect at all in postoperative pain. Research questions that need addressing now include finding the optimal dose, and whether combining gabapentin with conventional pain medicines might be better for postoperative pain than these conventional pain medicines on their own.
