Exercise therapy for treatment of non‐specific low back pain
Exercise therapy appears to be slightly effective at decreasing pain and improving function in adults with chronic low‐back pain, particularly in populations visiting a healthcare provider. In adults with subacute low‐back pain there is some evidence that a graded activity program improves absenteeism outcomes, though evidence for other types of exercise is unclear. For patients with acute low‐back pain, exercise therapy is as effective as either no treatment or other conservative treatments.
