Surfactant for meconium aspiration syndrome in term and late preterm infants
Lay title: Surfactant treatment for infants who have inhaled meconium into the lungs in or around the time of birth 
Review question: Does the administration of surfactant improve lung function and lead to better clinical outcomes in infants born at or near term who have inhaled meconium in or around the time of birth? 
Background: The lungs of newborn babies can be damaged by meconium aspiration syndrome. Meconium aspiration syndrome is caused when a stressed baby passes a bowel movement while still in the womb and then breathes some of this material into the lungs. Pulmonary surfactant, the complex combination of chemicals that line the surface of the lung, may be altered or inactivated in babies who have meconium aspiration. It is thought that treatment with additional surfactant might help overcome this damage. 
Study characteristics: Four randomised controlled trials enrolling 326 infants met our inclusion criteria. 
Results: This review of trials found that surfactant can prevent worsening of breathing difficulties and reduce the need for heart‚Äêlung bypass therapy in some babies suffering from meconium aspiration syndrome .
