Dapsone as an oral corticosteroid sparing agent for asthma
Some asthma sufferers rely on oral corticosteroids to control their disease. Corticosteroids help reduce the inflammation of the airways associated with asthma. Long‐term use of these drugs has serious side effects, so other ways to reduce the need for corticosteroids are sometimes tried. Dapsone does have anti‐inflammatory properties, and may have an effect on asthma symptoms and steroid doses taken. However, this review found that there was no evidence for or against the use of dapsone in the treatment of corticosteroid‐dependent asthmatic patients. More research is needed.
