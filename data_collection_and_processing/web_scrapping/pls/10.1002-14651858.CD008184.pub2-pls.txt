Cholesterol‐reducing drugs for brain haemorrhage (subarachnoid haemorrhage)
Subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH) is a serious condition where bleeding occurs over the surface of the brain. This bleeding usually comes from an abnormality (aneurysm) in one of the blood vessels on the brain surface. In addition to the damage caused by the initial bleeding, people with SAH often suffer a later reduction in blood flow to the brain and hence additional delayed brain injury. It has been proposed that cholesterol‐reducing drugs may reduce this delayed brain injury. This review found only one small trial of 39 participants. Cholesterol‐reducing drugs did not reduce the risk of delayed brain injury and did not significantly improve participants' degree of recovery. There were no significant differences in adverse events. This review is based on one small trial and no reliable conclusions can be drawn at present.
