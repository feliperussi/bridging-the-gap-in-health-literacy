Symphysis‚Äêfundal height measurement in pregnancy
Too little evidence to show whether measuring the height of the pregnant belly at antenatal visits leads to better outcomes. 
Many pregnant women have the distance from the lowest part of their uterus (womb) (near the pubic bone) to the highest part of their uterus measured with a tape measure (symphysis fundal height). Their caregiver may also feel and gently press the outside of the woman's pregnant uterus (abdominal palpation). This is to check the baby's size and position, the quantity of fluid around the baby and to diagnose multiple pregnancy. The review found that there is too little evidence to show whether symphysis fundal height measurement during pregnancy is more beneficial than abdominal palpation. Further research is needed.
