Drug‐free management of young children's pain during medical procedures
Background: Infant pain has been historically under‐managed. 
Review question: This review assessed 24 different ways of reducing young children's pain during medical procedures without using drugs, such as using a pacifier, distracting the child, and rocking a child. We analysed studies separately for babies who were born preterm, full‐term newborns, and older infants from one month to three years. We also looked at if there was a difference on the impact of the interventions depending on whether the infant had just had the painful procedure (pain reactivity), as opposed to calming down from their peak distress (immediate pain regulation). 
Study characteristics: This updated review examined 63 randomised controlled trials of 4905 participants. 
Key results and Quality of evidence: While there was evidence for non‐nutritive sucking, swaddling and tucking, massage, environment modification, rocking, video distraction, structured non‐parent involvement at different ages, and pain types, none of the analyses were based on sufficient evidence to allow us to draw firm conclusions (i.e. high quality studies from at least two independent laboratories).
