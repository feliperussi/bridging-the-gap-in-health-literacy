There is no evidence that radiotherapy could help to cure or to prolong the survival of patients with malignant pleural mesothelioma 
The incidence of malignant pleural mesothelioma is increasing and is expected to peak in many developed countries in the next two decades. In 80% of the patients with malignant pleural mesothelioma there is a clear history of occupational or domestic exposure to asbestos. Very few patients are suitable for any potentially curative treatment and the effectiveness of radical therapy with surgery, radiotherapy and/or chemotherapy in curing patients or prolonging survival is uncertain. The role of radiotherapy is controversial. It has been used as a component of multimodal therapy (plus chemotherapy and/or surgery). The reviewers have not found any reports of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that show that radiotherapy is an effective option for malignant pleural mesothelioma. There is a need for multicentre experimental studies assessing the role of radiotherapy in this disease.
