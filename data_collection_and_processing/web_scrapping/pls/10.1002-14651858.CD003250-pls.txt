Amniotomy plus intravenous oxytocin for induction of labour
Intravenous oxytocin and amniotomy compares well with other forms used in the third trimester (full term) to bring on labour. 
Sometimes it is necessary to help get labour started. There are several methods used and they either ripen the cervix or make the uterus start contracting. Oxytocin is a drug used to stimulate contractions of the uterus. Amniotomy (breaking the waters) helps bring on contractions. The review of trials found that oxytocin combined with amniotomy compares well with other forms of labour induction. However, adverse risks of amniotomy include pain and discomfort, bleeding, possible infection in the uterus and a decreased heart rate in the baby. The risk of infection following amniotomy is particularly important in areas where HIV is prevalent.
