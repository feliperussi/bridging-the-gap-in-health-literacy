Anticholinergics for neuroleptic‐induced acute akathisia
Akathisia is a common and distressing adverse effect of antipsychotic drugs and is characterised by restlessness and mental unease, both of which can be intense. Akathisia is associated with patterns of restless movement, including rocking, walking on the spot when standing, shuffling and tramping, or swinging one leg on the other when sitting. People may constantly pace up and down in an attempt to relieve the sense of unrest. Several strategies have been used to decrease akathisia, and this review is one in a series addressing the effects of drug treatments on such symptoms. We found no trial‐based evidence for the use of anticholinergic drugs for akathisia, thus rendering firm treatment recommendations impossible.
