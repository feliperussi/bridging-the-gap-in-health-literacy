Interventions for reducing medication errors in children in hospital
Medication safety is important for hospitalised children, as they are at risk of experiencing unintended harm as a result of medication errors. Hospitals implement various interventions to reduce medication errors. This review examines the effectiveness of these interventions. We included seven studies describing five different interventions. The clinical pharmacist, the computerised prescribing system and the barcode medication administration system are interventions at the organisational level. The check and control checklist and a preprinted order sheet are categorised as professional interventions. 
The introduction of a clinical pharmacist resulted in a significant decrease in serious medication errors in an intensive care setting, but these results were not seen on a medical and surgical ward. Also introduction of a computerised prescribing system and a check and control checklist did not result in conclusive results. The introduction of a barcode medication administration system and a preprinted order sheet resulted in a significant decrease in medication errors, but the benefits for paediatric patients in terms of less harm remain unclear. 
Despite extensive searching, we identified only seven studies for inclusion. Our assessment of the quality and strength of evidence from these studies is low. This review shows that only a handful of medication safety strategies are studied in robust study designs. When the vulnerability of paediatric patients in hospital is considered, more research of high quality should be included on every research agenda.
