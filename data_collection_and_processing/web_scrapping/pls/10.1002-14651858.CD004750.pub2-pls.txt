Superficial heat or cold for low back pain
There is moderate evidence that heat wrap therapy reduces pain and disability for patients with back pain that lasts for less than three months. The relief has only been shown to occur for a short time and the effect is relatively small. The addition of exercise to heat wrap therapy appears to provide additional benefit. There is still not enough evidence about the effect of the application of cold for low‐back pain of any duration, or for heat for back pain that lasts longer than three months. 
Heat treatments include hot water bottles, soft heated packs filled with grain, poultices, hot towels, hot baths, saunas, steam, heat wraps, heat pads, electric heat pads and infra‐red heat lamps. Cold treatments include ice, cold towels, cold gel packs, ice packs and ice massage.
