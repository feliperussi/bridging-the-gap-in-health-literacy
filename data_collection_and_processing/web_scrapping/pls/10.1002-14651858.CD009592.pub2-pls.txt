Removal of endometrial polyps prior to infertility treatment
Review question 
Cochrane authors investigated whether the removal of endometrial polyps in women presenting with subfertility was safe and whether it improved the chance of pregnancy. 
Background 
Endometrial polyps, which are benign and often asymptomatic growths of the lining of the womb, have the potential to interfere with female fertility. This can be due to alteration of the micro‚Äêenvironment of the womb or due to physical interference with sperm transport impeding fertilization and subsequent implantation of the embryo. Diagnosis of these growths is mainly through using ultrasound during routine investigations prior to treatment for infertility. Removal of these polyps prior to embarking on any fertility treatment has been suggested as a way to improve the overall outcome of the treatment. 
Study characteristics 
The authors did not identify any analysable studies that were of sufficient quality to draw any conclusions. The searches are current to July 2014. 
Key results and quality of evidence 
Due to the lack of available randomised evidence, the authors of this review are unable to draw any conclusions on the routine removal of endometrial polyps prior to treatments for infertility. To answer this question, large and well designed studies are required.
