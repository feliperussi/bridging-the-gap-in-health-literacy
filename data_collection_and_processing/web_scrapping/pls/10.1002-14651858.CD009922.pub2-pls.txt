De‐escalation techniques for psychosis‐induced aggression or agitation
Review question: 
Are de‐escalation techniques effective for managing psychosis‐induced aggression or agitation? 
Background 
Aggression is a willingness to inflict harm, regardless of whether this is behaviourally or verbally expressed and regardless of whether physical harm is sustained. 
De‐escalation is a psychosocial intervention for management of aggressive or agitated behaviour. It uses techniques that help someone with aggression or agitation to self‐monitor their emotions and self‐manage their behaviour to try and stop aggressive behaviour escalating. 
Searches 
We ran electronic searches (last searched April 2016) for trials that randomised people with psychosis who were displaying aggressive or agitated behaviour to receive de‐escalation techniques, standard care or other intervention to manage aggression. Three‐hundred and forty‐five records were found and checked by the review authors. 
Results 
No trials met the review requirements. There is no trial‐based evidence currently available assessing the effectiveness of de‐escalation techniques for managing aggression or agitation. 
Conclusions 
It is unclear why there are no randomised trials. Several issues such as cost, ethical considerations, difficulty recruiting people into trials, as well the ability to accurately quantify the effects of de‐escalation itself could all be contributing factors. Meanwhile, de‐escalation techniques are currently used without any trial‐based evidence that they are effective.
