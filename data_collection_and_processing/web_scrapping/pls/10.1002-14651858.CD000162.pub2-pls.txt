Pentoxifylline, propentofylline and pentifylline for acute ischaemic stroke
Methylxanthines can enlarge brain blood vessels but are of no apparent benefit in the early treatment of strokes caused by blood clots. Most strokes are caused by a blood clot which then reduces blood flow in the affected part of the brain. Without an adequate blood supply, the brain quickly suffers damage which is often permanent. Drugs which can improve brain blood flow might reduce damage and improve outcome after stroke. Methylxanthines can alter brain blood flow but we do not know if they improve patient recovery. We found five small trials which do not show any clear benefit. The use of methylxanthines in acute stroke cannot be recommended at present.
