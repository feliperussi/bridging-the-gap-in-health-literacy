Short acting beta2‐agonists for recurrent wheeze in children under two years of age
Beta‐agonists such as salbutamol are the most frequently prescribed reliever medication for asthma. They work well in adults and children but their effectiveness in infants is less clear. Eight trials were reviewed involving 229 patients in four different settings. Although infants have the capability to respond to salbutamol, there is only limited relief of acute symptoms when given to acutely ill patients. This did not impact on requirement for hospital admission or length of hospital stay. Regular salbutamol has not been shown to offer protection against developing symptoms.
