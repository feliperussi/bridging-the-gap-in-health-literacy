Local anaesthetic eye drops for prevention of pain in preterm infants undergoing screening for retinopathy of prematurity 
Infants born less than 1500 g or less than 32 weeks are at increased risk of retinopathy of prematurity, a potentially blinding eye condition, and so have routine ophthalmological assessment. This process is a recognised source of pain and discomfort for preterm infants. This review highlights that retinopathy of prematurity is a painful examination and that instillation of local anaesthetic eyedrops immediately prior to examination of the eye is associated with a reduction in pain scores, as assessed by validated pain scores. Ongoing research is required to determine the optimum local anaesthetic eyedrop and other potentially important methods of reducing pain, including swaddling, and sucrose.
