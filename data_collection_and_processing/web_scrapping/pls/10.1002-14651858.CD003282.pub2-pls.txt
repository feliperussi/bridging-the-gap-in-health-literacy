The frameless IUD performs similarly to traditional IUDs but does not reduce bleeding and pain associated with standard IUDs. 
Devices placed in the uterus are highly effective at preventing pregnancy. Traditional intrauterine devices (IUD) with plastic frames have side effects such as excessive bleeding and pain that were thought to be due to the frame. This review found that symptoms of bleeding and pain, and contraceptive efficacy were not improved with the frameless device. Trials are needed to see if the frameless IUDs could benefit women who have not had children.
