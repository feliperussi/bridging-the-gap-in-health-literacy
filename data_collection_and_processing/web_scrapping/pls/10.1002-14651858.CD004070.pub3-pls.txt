Vaginal chlorhexidine during labour for preventing maternal and neonatal infections (excluding group B streptococcal and HIV) 
Bacteria live in women's vaginas and generally cause no problems. Very occasionally they infect the placenta during labour and can pass to the baby, causing an infection. These infections can occasionally make the baby very ill and very occasionally the baby might die. 
The review of three trials (3012 participants) found there was not enough information to say whether the use of chlorhexidine washing of the vagina during labour led to fewer infections for mothers and babies. More research is needed.
