No evidence of the efficacy of non‐pharmacological interventions for domestic wandering in people with dementia due to lack of trials 
No randomised controlled trials were found that proved or disproved the efficacy of non‐pharmacological interventions for the prevention or management of wandering in the domestic setting. Trials of music therapy, bright light therapy, reality orientation, physical therapy, occupational therapy, and therapeutic touch have been carried out with participants in institutional settings. This review discusses these interventions in the light of their relevance to the domestic setting. Trials of non‐pharmacological interventions in the domestic setting are urgently needed.
