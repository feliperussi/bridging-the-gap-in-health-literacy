Use of SmartCare™ to aid discontinuing mechanical ventilation of adults in the postoperative period 
We searched the medical literature databases to May 2013. In a single large trial of high methodologic quality that involved 300 patients, use of a system (SmartCare™) that automatically adjusted ventilator settings and conducted tests of patients' ability to breathe spontaneously there was no clear benefit of SmartCare™. While it reduced the time to undergo the first test of spontaneous breathing, it did not reduce the time to the first successful spontaneous breathing test compared to a written weaning protocol applied by physicians. There was no clear benefit of SmartCare™ on other clinically important outcomes including the time to successful discontinuation of artificial ventilation , the total duration of mechanical ventilation, the time spent in the intensive care unit and hospital, and the requirement for tracheostomy (an airway inserted into the trachea). Further studies are needed to clarify the role of SmartCare™ in the postoperative setting, in general, and in specific patient populations.
