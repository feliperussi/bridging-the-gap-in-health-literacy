Amniotomy alone for induction of labour
There is not enough evidence about the effects of amniotomy alone (deliberate rupture of the membranes) to induce labour. 
Sometimes it is advisable to get labour started (induction) because of concerns about either the pregnant woman or her unborn baby. Amniotomy has been used as either the only method of inducing labour if the membranes can be reached, or used with drugs such as oxytocin or prostaglandin. Amniotomy may be preferred by women wanting a drug‚Äêfree labour and it is cheap. However, it can be uncomfortable and, if after amniotomy there is a long time interval before the baby is born, there is a risk of infection. There is also the risk of the cord coming out before the baby. This review of trials found that there is not enough evidence about the effects of amniotomy alone for the induction of labour.
