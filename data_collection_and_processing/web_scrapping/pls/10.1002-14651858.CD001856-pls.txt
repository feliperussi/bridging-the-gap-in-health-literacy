No evidence that medical anti‐shock trousers improve survival for people with trauma, and some suggestion they may worsen outcomes, but more trials are needed 
About one third of injury deaths are due to shock from blood loss. Preventing shock in people with uncontrolled bleeding is therefore vital. Treatment aims to maintain blood pressure, so that tissue damage is minimised. Medical anti‐shock trousers (MAST) are believed to increase blood pressure and blood flow to the heart and brain, helping to stabilise the person until they receive further treatment. The review of trials found no evidence that MAST application decreases deaths, with some suggestion that it may even do harm. More research is needed.
