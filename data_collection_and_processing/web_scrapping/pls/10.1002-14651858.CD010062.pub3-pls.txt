Sulthiame monotherapy for epilepsy 
Background 
Epilepsy is a common neurological condition characterised by recurrent seizures. Sulthiame (STM) is widely used as an antiepileptic drug in Europe and Israel. 
Review aims 
This review aimed to determine the efficacy and side effect profile of STM as monotherapy, when compared with placebo or another antiepileptic drug for people with epilepsy. 
Results 
We found four randomised controlled trials (studies in which participants are randomly assigned to one of two or more treatment groups) involving a total of 355 participants that looked at the effectiveness and tolerability of sulthiame used as a single treatment in epilepsy. Three studies were conducted on a common form of childhood epilepsy known as benign epilepsy of childhood with centrotemporal spikes, and one study was conducted on generalised tonic‐clonic seizures, a type of seizure that starts on both sides of the brain and causes stiffness or twitching throughout the body. Based on the available evidence, we could draw no meaningful conclusions on the effectiveness or tolerability of sulthiame as a single treatment in epilepsy. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the evidence is limited by small sizes of the groups being studied, significant risk of bias, and incomplete data on important outcome measures, as well as by the lack of an English translation of the full‐text manuscript of one study. 
Conclusions 
Further high‐quality research is needed to fully evaluate the effectiveness and tolerability of sulthiame as a single treatment in epilepsy. 
The evidence is current to April 2020.
