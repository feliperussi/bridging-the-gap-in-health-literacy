No evidence to support or refute probiotics for patients with non‐alcoholic fatty liver disease and/or steatohepatitis 
Probiotics have been proposed as a treatment option for patients with non‐alcoholic fatty liver disease and non‐alcoholic steatohepatitis because of their balancing role on the flora of the gut that may act as a potential source of hepatotoxic oxidative injury. This review did not identify any randomised clinical trials with probiotics in non‐alcoholic fatty liver disease and non‐alcoholic steatohepatitis. Even if the results from pilot studies seem promising, randomised clinical trials are necessary to asses the clinical implication of probiotics therapy in non‐alcoholic fatty liver disease and non‐alcoholic steatohepatitis.
