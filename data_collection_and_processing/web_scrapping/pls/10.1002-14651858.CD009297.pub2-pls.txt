Darbepoetin alfa to treat anaemia in people with chronic kidney disease
People who have chronic kidney disease (CKD) frequently experience anaemia. Several different medicines that treat anaemia are available including darbepoetin alfa. 
We investigated whether darbepoetin alfa might have different effects in people with CKD compared to placebo or no treatment, or similar other treatment options called epoetin or methoxy polyethylene glycol‐epoetin beta, and whether differing ways of administering darbepoetin (route and frequency of treatment) might have different benefits and harms for people who have CKD. 
While darbepoetin alfa reduced the need for patients to have blood transfusions to treat severe anaemia, darbepoetin alfa had little or no effect on survival or chances of needing dialysis therapy and their overall quality of life. 
There were not enough studies comparing darbepoetin alfa with other similar treatment options to provide sufficient information to guide clinical decision‐making about choosing which medicine is best for an individual patient. 
Little information was available about darbepoetin treatment for children who have CKD and adults who have received a kidney transplant or those treated with dialysis.
