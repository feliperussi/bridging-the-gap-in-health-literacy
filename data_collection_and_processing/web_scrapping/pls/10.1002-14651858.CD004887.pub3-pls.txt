Recombinant human activated factor VII for upper gastrointestinal bleeding in patients with liver diseases 
People with liver disease have an increased risk of upper gastrointestinal bleeding. Upper gastrointestinal bleeding is a frequent cause of morbidity and mortality in this population group. Due to severe liver damage, these people acquire coagulopathy (a bleeding disorder). Therefore, one of the approaches used for treating upper gastrointestinal bleeding is recombinant human activated factor VII, which is identical in structure and activity to human factor VII. The review includes two randomised clinical trials with 493 participants. The risk of bias was low. Both trials compared recombinant human activated factor VII with placebo. The meta‚Äêanalysis showed that the recombinant human activated factor VII does not seem to reduce mortality in patients with liver disease and suffering from upper gastrointestinal bleeding, irrespective of the grade of liver damage. The current evidence is insufficient to support or reject recombinant human activated factor VII for these patients.
