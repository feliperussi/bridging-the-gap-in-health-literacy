Does delivery of home care by outreach nurses improve outcomes for people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease? 
Home visits from nurses for people with chronic lung disease (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, COPD ‚Äê a combinations of emphysema and chronic bronchitis) aim to help people maintain their health and reduce the need for hospital stays. The nurses delivering this care aim to help people use their treatments well, provide education about coping strategies, and monitor the lung disease. However, this review of nine randomised controlled trial found that home care resulted in an improvement in people's quality of life, but has an unpredictable effect on the risk of being admitted to hospital. We could only find information on the cost of care from one study, but this indicated that home care was an expensive form of care. More research is needed to confirm the usefulness of home visits for people with COPD.
