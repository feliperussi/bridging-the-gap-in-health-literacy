Relaxin for cervical ripening and induction of labour
Not enough evidence that relaxin helps ripen the cervix and induce labour.
Relaxin is a hormone secreted by the placenta in the final stages of pregnancy to ripen the neck of the uterus (cervix) and prepare it for labour. It is used to induce labour and is either made from genetically combined human relaxin or from animal preparations. The role of relaxin treatment remains unclear but it is possible that it may relax the muscle tissue of the uterus and therefore not work as well as other methods of induction. The review of trials found there was not enough research to show the true effect of relaxin. More research is needed.
