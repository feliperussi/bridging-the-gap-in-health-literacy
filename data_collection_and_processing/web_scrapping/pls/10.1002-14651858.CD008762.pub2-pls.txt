Aloe vera for treating acute and chronic wounds
Aloe vera is a cactus‚Äêlike, succulent plant which grows in tropical climates. Aloe vera is widely used in a variety of cosmetics including creams and toiletries. Some studies conducted in animals have suggested that Aloe vera may help wound healing. Aloe vera can be applied topically as a cream or gel, or can be impregnated into a dressing and applied to the wound.  The authors of this Cochrane Review wanted to find evidence on whether Aloe vera encourages wound healing in people with acute wounds (for example lacerations, surgical incisions and burns) and chronic wounds (for example infected wounds, arterial and venous ulcers). The review found that there was not enough research evidence to answer this question.
