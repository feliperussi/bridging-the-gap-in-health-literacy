Topical umbilical cord care at birth
No evidence that applying sprays, creams or powders are any better than keeping the baby's cord clean and dry at birth. 
The umbilical cord connects the baby to its food and oxygen supply in the womb, and is clamped and cut at birth. The cord stump dries, shrivels and becomes black before falling off the baby's belly button, five to 15 days after birth. Without proper care, the baby may become infected through the stump. Usually the cord is kept clean and dry by loosely covering it with clean clothes. Hand washing is critical. The review found that not enough trials had been done to show if antiseptics or antibiotics were any better at keeping infection away. More research is needed.
