Reduced‐dose radiotherapy/chemotherapy compared to standard‐dose treatment after keyhole surgery for throat cancer caused by human papillomavirus 
Review question 
What are the effects of reduced‐dose radiotherapy/chemotherapy treatment compared to standard‐dose treatment after keyhole surgery for throat cancer caused by human papillomavirus (HPV)? 
Background 
More than 400,000 cases of cancer of the throat are diagnosed each year and this is increasing, with HPV being a significant factor. Throat cancer caused by this virus often affects younger patients but has a better prognosis than non‐viral throat cancer. Traditional treatment for throat cancer is with radiotherapy and chemotherapy as this had been shown to have similar survival outcomes to surgery but with fewer side effects. However, treatments have evolved, such as computerised planning and improvements in radiotherapy, and the development of keyhole surgery, which have the potential for fewer side effects. Chemotherapy and radiotherapy do have long‐term negative effects on quality of life. With younger patients being affected, any way of reducing these side effects should be investigated. 
Study characteristics 
In April 2018, we searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that had compared reduced‐dose radiotherapy/chemotherapy treatment with standard‐dose treatment. We were interested in the outcomes of overall survival and disease‐free survival, as well as the effects on swallowing ability and voice. Our searches did not identify any completed RCTs, however three relevant studies are ongoing and the first results are expected between 2021 and 2023. 
Key results 
Currently there is no high‐quality evidence comparing these two treatments, however such trials are in progress.
