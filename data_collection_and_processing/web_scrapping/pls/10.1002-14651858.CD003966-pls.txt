Short courses of antibiotics (2‐4 days) are as effective as longer treatment for bladder infections in children. 
Bladder and kidney infections (urinary tract infections ‐ UTI) are common in children. Bladder infections cause pain on passing urine and frequency of urination. Some children keep getting repeat bouts. Standard courses of antibiotics (7‐10 days) are used to clear the infection. Shorter courses may reduce adverse effects and costs, but there has been concern that they might reduce the chances of clearing the infection and increase the risk of recurrence. A review of studies found that short courses of antibiotics (2‐4 days) used for bladder infections are as effective as standard courses at clearing UTI, with no increase in recurrence.
