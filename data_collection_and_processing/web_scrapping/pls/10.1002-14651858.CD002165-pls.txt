Pneumonia (pneumococcal) vaccine for children and adults with asthma
Pneumonia is a serious illness for people who have asthma and pneumococcal vaccine has been studied to see if it reduces illness or death in those people. A thorough search for randomised controlled trials of pneumococcal vaccine in asthma has found only one small study in children which was not of high quality. This showed a reduction in the rate of asthma attacks from ten per year to seven per year. Randomised trials to test pneumococcal vaccine in asthmatic children and adults are needed to assess how beneficial it is for asthmatics to receive this vaccination.
