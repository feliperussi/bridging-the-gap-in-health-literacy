Can lobeline help people to quit smoking
Lobeline is an alkaloid derived from the leaves of an Indian tobacco plant, and has been widely used in commercial smoking remedies. Its adverse effects include dizziness, nausea, and vomiting, and tablets and pastilles containing Lobeline may lead to throat irritation. The review found no adequate long‐term trials which could provide evidence that Lobeline can help people stop smoking. One large study with only s ix weeks follow‐up did not detect any evidence of short‐term b enefit , suggesting that lobeline is not an e ffective treatment.
