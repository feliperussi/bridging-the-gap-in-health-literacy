House dust mite avoidance measures for perennial allergic rhinitis
Perennial allergic rhinitis (all‐year hay fever like symptoms) is an allergic disorder which can be triggered by house dust mites and causes a congested, runny nose, nasal itching and sneezing. Avoiding the allergic triggers (such as house dust mites) should in theory help to reduce the symptoms of allergic rhinitis in sensitised individuals. 
There is limited evidence that measures to reduce the numbers of house dust mites might improve symptoms of allergic rhinitis, but more research is needed to clarify the effectiveness of acaricides (chemicals which kill mites) both as a single intervention and as part of a more multi‐faceted approach incorporating high efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters, allergy control bedding or both. 
Overall, this review of trials found that acaricides and extensive bedroom‐based environmental control programmes might reduce symptoms of allergic rhinitis for some people, but the evidence is not strong. More research is needed.
