The effect of inotropes on morbidity and mortality in preterm infants with low systemic or organ blood flow 
Low systemic blood flow is common in extremely premature infants and has been associated with brain and intestinal injury, death and developmental impairment. It is unclear what is the best strategy to prevent or treat this. The usual strategy for supporting the cardiovascular system of the preterm infant is to treat infants with low blood pressure with agents (inotropes) aimed at increasing blood pressure. However, many of infants with low blood flow have normal blood pressure. One trial was found that examined the effect of inotropes in infants with low systemic blood flow. The trial found that many infants failed to respond to the two commonly used inotropes (dobutamine and dopamine) and neither was better at improving outcomes of very preterm babies. Further research is needed to determine the best strategy for preventing or treating low systemic or organ blood flow in these very immature babies.
