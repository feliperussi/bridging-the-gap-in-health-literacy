Antiepileptic drugs for the primary and secondary prevention of seizures in viral encephalitis 
Background  Viral encephalitis is characterised by inflammation and swelling of the brain and is caused by viral infection. Seizures can occur both during viral encephalitis and as a later consequence following resolution of the infection. Patients who have seizures during encephalitis are more likely to die or have a disability; some may also develop prolonged or repeated seizures, which can be very difficult to treat. As not all patients will develop seizures, it is unclear whether the use of antiepileptic drugs in patients with viral encephalitis before they have seizures can prevent further seizures and improve their outcome. It is also not clear whether the use of these drugs after the first seizure can prevent the occurrence of further seizures and long‐term epilepsy. 
Results  We did not find any high‐quality clinical trials that assessed whether the use of antiepileptic drugs in patients with no seizures or one seizure is more effective than placebo in preventing seizures and improving the outcome in viral encephalitis. 
Conclusions  Further research is needed to assess the efficacy and tolerability of antiepileptic drugs for the primary and secondary prophylaxis of seizures. 
The evidence is current to April 2016.
