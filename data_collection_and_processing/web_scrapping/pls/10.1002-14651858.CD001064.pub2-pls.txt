Piracetam for fetal distress in labour
Piracetam is thought to support the metabolism of brain cells when they have an insufficient oxygen supply (hypoxia). It may, therefore, prevent any adverse effects for an infant with persistent fetal distress during labour. 
This review set out to assess the effects of piracetam for suspected fetal distress in labour on method of delivery and newborn ill effects (morbidity). Only one controlled trial was identified. The trial randomised 96 women to receive either piracetam or a placebo.Â Piracetam treatment was associated with a trend toward reduced need for a caesarean section as the method of delivery and an improved outcome for the newborn as determined by respiratory problems and signs of hypoxia. The trial did not provide information about any side effects experienced by the mother. This evidence is insufficient for meaningful conclusions.
