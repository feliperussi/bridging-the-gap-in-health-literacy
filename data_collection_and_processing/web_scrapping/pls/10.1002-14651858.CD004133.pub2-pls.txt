Angioplasty for intracranial artery stenosis
There is insufficient evidence to support the use of angioplasty for intracranial artery stenosis. Narrowing of the arteries inside the skull is a significant cause of stroke. Medical treatment for prevention consists of the control of risk factors such as high blood pressure, diabetes, and high cholesterol. Blood thinners are also used, but none has been demonstrated to be superior to another. Angioplasty, a procedure for opening narrowed arteries by means of a balloon or stent, is feasible but its safety and efficacy is not known. This review found no randomised controlled trials and no evidence to support the use of this procedure in routine practice. More research is needed to establish the role of this procedure in the treatment of this disease.
