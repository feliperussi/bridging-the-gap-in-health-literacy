Topical anaesthesia for needle‐related pain in newborn infants
Lay title 
Topical anaesthesia for newborn infants who require a needle‐related procedure.
Review question 
Does the application of a topical anaesthetic applied on the skin reduce pain in newborn infants who require a procedure that punctures the skin? 
Background 
Some newborn infants require a painful procedure that involves the puncturing of the skin such as heel lancing and venepuncture (puncture of a vein to get blood samples or give medicines) or intramuscular injection. Painful procedures can be stressful for newborn infants and the witnessing of painful procedures can be distressing for parents. One intervention that can be used before a needle insertion procedure is application of a topical local anaesthetic to numb the skin. 
Study characteristics 
Eight clinical trials enrolling 506 newborn infants met our inclusion criteria.
Results and quality of the evidence 
This review of trials found that overall there is not enough good quality evidence to say if topical local anaesthetics applied to the skin help relieve pain during needle‐related pain in newborn infants. Large well‐design clinical trials are needed.
