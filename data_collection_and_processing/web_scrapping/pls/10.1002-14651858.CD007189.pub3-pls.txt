Antiretroviral pre‐exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) for preventing HIV in high‐risk individuals
This review evaluated the effects of giving people at high risk for HIV infection drugs to prevent infection (called antiretroviral pre‐exposure prophylaxis, or PrEP). We found six randomised controlled trials that assessed the effects of oral tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) plus emtricitabine (FTC) versus placebo; TDF versus placebo, and daily TDF‐FTC versus intermittent TDF‐FTC. One of the trials had three study arms (TDF, TDF‐FTC and placebo arm). The trials were carried out amongst different risk groups, including HIV‐uninfected men who have sex with men, people in serodiscordant sexual relationships where one partner is infected and the other is not, and other high risk men and women. The findings suggests that the use of TDF alone or TDF+FTC reduces the risk of becoming infected with HIV. However, further studies are need to evaluate the method of administration (daily versus intermittent dosing), long‐term safety and cost effectiveness of PrEP in different risk groups and settings.
