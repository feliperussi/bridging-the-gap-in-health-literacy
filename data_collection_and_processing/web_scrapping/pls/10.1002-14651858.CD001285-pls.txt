Inhaled short acting beta2‐agonist use in chronic asthma: regular versus as needed treatment 
During an asthma attack, the airways narrow causing wheezing, coughing and breathlessness. Inhaled short acting beta‐2 agonists, such as salbutamol or terbutaline, are commonly used as bronchodilators to relieve these symptoms. They can be used regularly or only when needed and are often used without medical supervision, raising concerns about the possibility of excessive use. The review of trials found little difference between the two methods.
