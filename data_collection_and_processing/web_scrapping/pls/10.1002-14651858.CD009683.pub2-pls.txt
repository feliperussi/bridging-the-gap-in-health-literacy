Use of topiramate for the treatment of essential tremor
Review question 
The authors of this review tried to assess the effectiveness and safety of topiramate in people with essential tremor. 
Background 
Essential tremor is a type of uncontrollable shaking or trembling of parts of the body. Although it is not harmful in terms of its effect on life expectancy, it generally gets worse and may be disabling. Treatment is usually with medicines (called propranolol and primidone), which may not work in a quarter to a half of people with essential tremor. Some specialists have suggested that another medicine, topiramate, could be useful for treating the condition. 
Study characteristics 
We searched medical databases for studies of topiramate compared with placebo (a pretend tablet) or any other medicine in adults with essential tremor. We found three studies comparing topiramate versus placebo, involving 309 participants with moderate to severe essential tremor. 
Key results 
The effect of topiramate on daily activities, risk of stopping treatment and side effects was uncertain because the quality of evidence was very low to low. 
Quality of evidence 
We only found a few studies that had problems with their methods so we could not make firm conclusions about how well topiramate works and if it has side effects.
