Interventions for treating oral candidiasis for patients with cancer receiving treatment
Cancer treatment can lead to severe fungal infections (candidiasis, called thrush) in the mouth. This can cause pain, difficulties in eating and longer hospital stays. Infection can sometimes spread through the body and become life‚Äêthreatening. Different drugs are used to try and relieve candidiasis. There is insufficient evidence that any of the antifungal drugs may cure fungal infections in the mouth for people with cancer and more research is needed.
