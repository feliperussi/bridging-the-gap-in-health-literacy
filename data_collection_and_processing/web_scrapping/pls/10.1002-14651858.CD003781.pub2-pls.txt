Anticholinergic drugs in patients with overactive bladder syndrome.
An overactive bladder is a condition in which bladder contracts suddenly without any control, resulting in feeling to urinate and or leakage of urine. This is a common condition in adults and is also called as 'irritable' bladder or detrusor instability, urge or urgency‚Äêfrequency syndrome. Overactive bladder becomes more common with advancing age. Anticholinergic drugs mainly by their muscle relaxant action can help adults with symptoms of urinary frequency, urgency and urge incontinence. 
The review of trials found that on average people taking anticholinergic medication had about five less trips to the toilet and four less leakage episodes every week, with modest improvements in quality of life. About one in three people taking the drugs reported a dry mouth.
