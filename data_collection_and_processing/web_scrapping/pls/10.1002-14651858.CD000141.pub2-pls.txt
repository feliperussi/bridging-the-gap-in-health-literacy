Multiple vs. single doses of exogenous surfactant for the prevention or treatment of neonatal respiratory distress syndrome 
Multiple doses of surfactant have more benefit than a single dose.
Surfactant is essential to normal lung function in babies. Respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) is caused by a lack of, or dysfunction in, surfactant. A variety of surfactants (ranging for synthetic to animal derived) have been manufactured and are given to babies at risk for or having RDS. This review of trials found that multiple doses, rather than a single dose, further improved babies' outcomes. Multiple doses decreased the need for mechanical ventilation (machine‚Äêassisted breathing). In trials using animal derived surfactant in babies with RDS, multiple dose treatment lowered the risk of lung complications and there was a trend towards lowering the risk of death as well. In infants at high risk of respiratory distress, a policy of multiple doses of synthetic surfactant resulted in greater improvements regarding oxygenation and ventilatory requirements, a decreased risk of intestinal injury (necrotizing enterocolitis) and decreased mortality.
