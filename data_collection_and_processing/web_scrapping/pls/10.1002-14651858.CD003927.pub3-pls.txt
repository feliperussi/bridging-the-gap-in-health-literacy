Oral betamimetics for maintenance therapy after threatened preterm labour
A substantial proportion of women who have an episode of threatened preterm labour (before 37 weeks) are actively treated with agents that stop the uterine contractions (tocolytic therapy) and they do not progress to give birth. After being successfully treated for an episode of threatened preterm birth, women may then take medication (tocolytics) to prolong gestation so that their baby is not born too early. Medications used for this purpose include betamimetics, magnesium sulphate, calcium channel blockers and COX inhibitors. 
Oral betamimetics for maintenance therapy after threatened preterm labour do not prevent preterm labour. This conclusion is based on 13 randomised controlled trials with a total of 1551 women. In this review, the betamimetics ritodrine and terbutaline did not reduce the rate of preterm birth (eight trials), or prevent problems with babies that required admission to the neonatal intensive care unit (two trials), when compared with placebo, no treatment or other tocolytic drugs. Betamimetics may cause pregnant women to have an increased heart rate (palpitations) and rate of breathing, low blood pressure, nausea and vomiting, and high blood sugar concentrations as side effects.
