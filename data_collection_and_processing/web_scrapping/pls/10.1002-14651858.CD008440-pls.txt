Therapy for treating HIV infection in pregnant women who require treatment for their own health 
Pregnant human immunodeficiency virus‐infected (HIV)‐infected women often need treatment with antiretroviral therapy (ART) for their own health. Mother‐to‐child transmission (MTCT) is the most common way that children worldwide become HIV infected. Treatment of HIV‐infected pregnant women with ART decreases the risk of HIV MTCT. It is possible to decrease the risk of MTCT to 1‐2% with the use of antiretroviral medications, caesarean section before labour begins, and avoiding breastfeeding. When women who require HIV treatment for the benefit of their own health become pregnant, we need to know the most effective therapy, the impact of the drug on the MTCT of HIV, and what the potential complications of the therapy might be for both the mother and her unborn child.
