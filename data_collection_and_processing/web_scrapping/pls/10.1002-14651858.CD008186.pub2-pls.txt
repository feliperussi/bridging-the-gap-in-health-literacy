Water‐based exercises for improving activities of daily living after stroke
Many people who have had a stroke have limited activities of daily living and reducing disability is one of the main goals of rehabilitation. Water‐based exercises are used in rehabilitation and might help to reduce disability after stroke. This review of four trials, which included 94 participants, found there is not enough evidence to decide if water‐based exercises may reduce disability after stroke. There is a lack of hard evidence for water‐based exercises after stroke. More research is therefore needed.
