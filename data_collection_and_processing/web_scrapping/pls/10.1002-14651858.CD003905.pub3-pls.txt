Surgical treatment options for carpal tunnel syndrome
There is no strong evidence for the replacement of standard open carpal tunnel release (OCTR) by alternative surgical procedures for the treatment of carpal tunnel syndrome. The decision to apply special, minimally invasive operations instead of standard OCTR seems to be guided by the surgeon's and patient's preferences. 
Carpal tunnel syndrome is a common disorder causing pins and needles and pain in the hand due to compression of the median nerve in the carpal tunnel at the wrist. Its severity can range from mild to severe. Severe cases are generally treated surgically. This review aimed to compare different surgical options for the treatment of carpal tunnel syndrome. Current evidence from randomised controlled trials showed that none of the alternatives to standard open carpal tunnel release seem to offer better relief from symptoms in the short‐ or long‐term, although a special type of operation (endoscopic carpal tunnel release) seems to enable people to return to their work or daily activities sooner (on average approximately a week).
