Anti‐fibrinolytic drugs for reducing blood loss and the need for red blood cell transfusions during and after surgery. 
Aprotinin, although effective in reducing bleeding, had a higher rate of death than tranexamic acid and aminocaproic acid, which appeared free of serious side‐effects. Aprotinin has been withdrawn from world markets because of safety concerns. This review of over 250 clinical trials found that anti‐fibrinolytic drugs used at the time of major surgery reduce bleeding, the need for transfusions of red blood cells and the need for repeat surgery because of bleeding. With the exception of aprotinin the drugs appear safe.
