Antistaphylococcal immunoglobulins to prevent staphylococcal infection in very low birth weight infants 
Babies born at earlier gestation and who are born with low birth weight are at significant risk of sepsis. This is in part due to the immaturity of the immune defence system, including low levels of immunoglobulins. Researchers attempted to boost the immune system by artificially providing antibodies specific to the most common bacteria causing such infections. Three studies reviewed here (two of which are pilot studies) revealed neither benefit nor risk associated with the preventative use of specific antibodies to common bacterial infections.
