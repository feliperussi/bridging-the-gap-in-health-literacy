Adjuvant radiotherapy for stage I endometrial cancer
Women with stage I (early) endometrial cancer have a low risk of recurrence of their disease. Less than 10% of women treated with surgery alone have a recurrence after surgery. This risk is significantly higher (and may be double) for some women with high risk factors including aggressive cell types (grade 3) and deep invasion of the muscle (stage IC). External beam radiotherapy (EBRT) after surgery reduces the risk that the cancer will initially recur in the pelvis by around two‐thirds compared to surgery alone, but does not reduce the risk of death. 
EBRT carries an inherent risk of lasting treatment‐related side‐effects and routine use should be avoided in stage I endometrial cancer. However, from the available evidence, we cannot exclude the possibility of EBRT benefiting women with high‐risk stage I disease. Vaginal brachytherapy (VBT) appears to be useful in reducing locoregional recurrence and may be associated with less side‐effects than EBRT.
