Antiplatelet therapy for preventing stroke and other vascular events after carotid endarterectomy 
Patients with narrowing of one of the major blood vessels to the brain, the internal carotid artery, are at risk of stroke. The surgical operation to remove the narrowing (carotid endarterectomy) can reduce the long‚Äêterm risk of stroke. Drugs such as aspirin which prevent blood platelets forming clots (antiplatelet drugs) can also reduce the risk of stroke, but can sometimes cause serious bleeding. This review showed that antiplatelet drugs can also reduce the risk of stroke in patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy. There was limited information on bleeding risk. The review's conclusions supported the routine use of antiplatelet drugs such as aspirin in patients having carotid endarterectomy.
