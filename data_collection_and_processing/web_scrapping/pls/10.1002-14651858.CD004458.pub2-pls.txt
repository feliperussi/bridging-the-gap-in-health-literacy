Functional endoscopic sinus surgery (FESS) for chronic rhinosinusitis
Rhinosinusitis is a common and well‐recognised clinical syndrome affecting patients of all ages and gender. Functional endoscopic sinus surgery (FESS) is now a well‐established strategy, which comprises several techniques, for the treatment of chronic rhinosinusitis which has not responded to medical treatment. FESS is a set of minimally invasive surgical techniques which allow direct visual examination and opening of the sinuses. 
Three randomised controlled trials, involving 212 participants, met the inclusion criteria for this review. The evidence available does not demonstrate that FESS, as practised in the included trials, is superior to medical treatment with or without sinus irrigation in patients with chronic rhinosinusitis. There were no major complications in any of the included trials and FESS appears to be a safe procedure. More randomised controlled trials comparing FESS with medical and other treatments, with long‐term follow up, are required.
