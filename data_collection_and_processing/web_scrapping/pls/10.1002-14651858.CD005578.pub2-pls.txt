Pharmacotherapy for tooth grinding or clenching during the sleep (sleep bruxism)
Background 
There are several signs and symptoms of sleep bruxism, such as abnormal tooth wear, fractured teeth, jaw muscle discomfort, joint pain or tenderness, and headaches. Treatments include odontological devices such as occlusal splints, psychotherapy and medications (pharmacotherapy). Pharmacological treatments include drugs such as benzodiazepines, anticonvulsants, beta‐blockers, dopamine agents, antidepressants, muscle relaxants and others. However, little is known about the effectiveness, safety and long‐term follow‐up of medications for sleep bruxism. 
Study characteristics 
We searched scientific databases for clinical trials comparing any drug with placebo (a dummy treatment), other drugs or no treatment in people of any age with sleep bruxism. The evidence is current to August 2014. 
Key results 
A total of 18 studies were identified and seven were included in the review. Each individual study involved a very small number of participants (7‐16) and four of them were of moderate methodological quality. Amitriptyline (three studies), bromocriptine (one study), clonidine (one study), propranolol (one study), levodopa (Prolopa®) (one study) and tryptophan (one study) were compared with placebo. Amitriptyline and L‐tryptophan did not reduce activity of the jaw muscles, measured using electromyography. Bromocriptine,clonidine, propanolol and levodopa did not significantly reduce the number of bruxism episodes per hour when compared to placebo. 
Quality of the evidence 
This systematic review concluded that there is not enough evidence in the literature to show that drugs can reduce sleep bruxism.
