Co‐formulated abacavir‐lamivudine‐zidovudine for treating HIV infection and AIDS
The primary objective of this review was to evaluate the antiviral efficacy of co‐formulated abacavir‐lamivudine‐zidovudine for initial treatment of HIV infection. The secondary objectives were to evaluate the safety and tolerability of the triple drug combination. We identified 15 potentially eligible studies, four of which met our inclusion criteria. Our findings indicate that co‐formulated abacavir‐lamivudine‐zidovudine remains a viable option for initiating antiretroviral therapy, especially in HIV‐infected patients with pre‐existing hyperlipidaemia and those who do not tolerate ritonavir.
