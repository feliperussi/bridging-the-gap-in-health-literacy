Comparing sedation versus general anaesthesia for children who need to have dental treatment 
Review question 
This updated Cochrane systematic review aimed to look at evidence comparing use of sedation versus general anaesthesia to help children (up to 18 years of age) undergoing dental treatment. We wanted to see which (if any) approach allowed dental treatment to be carried out safely and effectively. We were also interested in the relative financial cost of each approach. 
Background 
At present, children unable to cope with dental care under local anaesthetic may be given general anaesthesia or sedation to help them. This choice is dependent on factors such as patient or dentist preference, the cost of the procedure or local regulations. Some people believe that sedation is better for this, as patients prefer it and it may be cheaper. 
Methods 
For our original review, we searched the databases until October 2008. For this updated review, we searched the following databases to July 2015: CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, LILACS and ISI Web of Science. 
Key results 
Unfortunately, we could not identify any randomized controlled trials on this topic. These trials are required for comparison of dental general anaesthesia versus sedation, to quantify differences such as morbidity and cost.
