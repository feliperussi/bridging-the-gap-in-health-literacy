Postoperative procedures for improving fertility following pelvic reproductive surgery
There is insufficient evidence to show the benefit or harm of routine hydrotubation or second‐look laparoscopy following surgery on a woman's reproductive system. Surgery to correct tubal damage is undertaken to improve pregnancy and live birth rates. Laparoscopy (where the abdominal organs are examined through a small surgical cut in the abdomen) to treat postoperative adhesions and postoperative hydrotubation (flushing out of the fallopian tubes) have been used to improve the results of tubal surgery. The review of trials found there is insufficient evidence to support the routine practice of hydrotubation or this second‐look laparoscopy after pelvic reproductive surgery. More research is needed.
