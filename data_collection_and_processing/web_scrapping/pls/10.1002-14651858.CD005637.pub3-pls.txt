Prophylactic antibiotics for transcervical intrauterine procedures
The administration of antibiotics before or following transcervical intrauterine procedures may prevent infection. The lower genital tract is an area which is abundant with normal flora (resident bacteria) so that operative procedures which pass through it may increase the risk of infection. The operative procedure may cause contamination of the uterine cavity with vaginal or cervical flora, or both. In addition, the associated trauma may compromise the ability of the uterus to combat infection. The prophylactic administration of antibiotics (giving antibiotics before the development of any infection) in women undergoing transcervical intrauterine procedures may prevent infection post‐procedure. There have been no randomised controlled trials evaluating the usefulness of antibiotics for the prevention of infection after these procedures. Therefore we could not draw any conclusions regarding the use of prophylactic antibiotics for the prevention of post‐procedure transcervical intrauterine infections
