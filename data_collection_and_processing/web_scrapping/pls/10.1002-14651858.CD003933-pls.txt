Terbutaline pumps may not be able to prevent a woman who had preterm labor stopped with drugs going back into labor too soon. 
Women who go into very early labor (before 34 weeks) and have their contractions stopped by intravenous drugs are at high risk of going back into preterm labor. Terbutaline is a drug that can relax the uterus and possibly stop contractions. Taken orally, though, it does not seem to prevent contractions returning. Another option is to use a small portable pump that feeds a continuous dose of terbutaline under the skin. The review found there are not enough large trials to show whether this is safe or effective. Some evidence suggests that terbutaline by pump does not prevent the return of preterm labor.
