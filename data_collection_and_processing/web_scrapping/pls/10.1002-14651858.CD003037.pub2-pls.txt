Medical methods for early termination of pregnancy can be safe and effective.
There are several different surgical techniques for early termination of pregnancy (abortion in the first three months). Several drugs can also be prescribed alone or in combination to terminate early pregnancy. This is called medical abortion, and uses the hormones prostaglandins and/or mifepristone (an antiprogesterone often called RU486), and/or methotrexate. The review of trials found that medical methods for abortion in early pregnancy can be safe and effective, with the most evidence of effectiveness for a combination of mifepristone and misoprostol (a prostaglandin). Almost all of the trials were done in well‐resourced hospitals where women returned for check‐up.
