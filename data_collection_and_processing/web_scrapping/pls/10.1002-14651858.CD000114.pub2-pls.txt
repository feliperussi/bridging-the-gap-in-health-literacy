Instruments to use for chorionic villus sampling for prenatal diagnosis
More research is needed to identify the best surgical instruments and techniques to use for chorionic villus sampling testing during early pregnancy (before 15 weeks). 
Chorionic villus sampling (CVS) is a test where a small piece of placental tissue (chorion) is removed from the pregnant woman's womb (uterus) and used for testing for genetic disorders. The tissue can be removed through the cervix or through the abdomen using plastic or metal tubes (cannulae), biopsy forceps or fine needles. The woman's risk of miscarriage increases if several attempts are needed to obtain sufficient placental tissue or the gestational sac is damaged during the procedure using ultrasound guidance. 
The review found there is some evidence that small forceps may be more effective and less painful for the woman than using an aspiration cannula for sampling through the cervix (transcervical CVS). However, there was no difference in risk of miscarriage. When sampling was obtained through the abdomen (transabdominal CVS) using a needle with either a continuous or discontinuous negative pressure aspiration system, there was no difference in the effectiveness of the techniques, the amount of pain or in the risk of miscarriage. Forceps and cannulae were evaluated in five transcervical CVS trials involving 472 women. Two trials involving 285 women compared different needle techniques for transabdominal CVS. These randomised trials are too small to provide reliable evidence in favour of one particular instrument or technique for transcervical or transabdominal chorionic villus sampling.
