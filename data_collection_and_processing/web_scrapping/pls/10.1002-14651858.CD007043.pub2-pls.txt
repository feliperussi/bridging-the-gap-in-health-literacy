Copper IUDs versus long‐acting hormone injections and implants for contraception
Reversible, long‐term contraception is relied on by millions of women to prevent unwanted pregnancy. Two very common methods of pregnancy prevention are the use of a copper‐containing intrauterine device (IUD) or an injection of a progestogen hormone. 
We reviewed studies that compared these two highly effective methods and found the IUD to be better at preventing pregnancy than depot medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA). Relevant to HIV positive women are the results of one small trial that found that women using the IUD for contraception where less likely to experience a worsening of their HIV disease than those using hormonal contraception. A large, high quality study is urgently needed to shed light on these findings.
