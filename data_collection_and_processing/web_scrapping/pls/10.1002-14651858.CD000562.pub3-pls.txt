Psychological treatments for people with bulimia nervosa and binging
Bulimia nervosa (BN) is an eating disorder in which people binge on food and then try to make up for this by extreme measures such as making themselves sick, taking laxatives or starving themselves. We reviewed studies of psychotherapies, including a specific form of psychotherapy called cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT‐BN). We compared psychotherapy to control groups who got no treatment (e.g. people on waiting lists) and the specific CBT‐BN with other types of psychotherapy. We found that CBT was better than other therapies, and better than no treatment, at reducing binge eating. Other psychotherapies were also better than no treatment in reducing binge eating. Some studies found that self‐help using the CBT manual can be helpful, but more research and larger trials are needed.
