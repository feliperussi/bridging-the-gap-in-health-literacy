Antiretrovirals for reducing the risk of mother‐to‐child transmission of HIV infection
At the end of 2009, 2.5 million children under the age of 15 years were estimated to be living with HIV/AIDS (WHO 2011). The majority of these children acquired their infections as a result of mother‐to‐child transmission during pregnancy, labor, or breastfeeding. Antiretroviral drugs administered to the HIV‐infected mother and/or to her child during pregnancy, labor, or breastfeeding can reduce mother‐to‐child transmission of HIV. The objective of this review is to determine whether a regimen of antiretroviral drugs leads to a significant reduction in HIV transmission during pregnancy and labor without serious side‐effects. 
The 25 trials found eligible for this review included 18,901 participants.The included trials compared the use of antiretrovirals versus placebo, longer regimens versus shorter regimens using the same antiretrovirals, and antiretroviral regimens using different drugs and drug combinations. This review of trials found that short courses of certain antiretroviral drugs are effective in reducing mother‐to‐child transmission of HIV, but are not associated with any safety concerns in the short term.
