Laparoscopy versus laparotomy (open surgery) for early‐stage ovarian cancer
BackgroundStage I ovarian cancer is diagnosed when the tumour is confined to one or both ovaries, without spread to lymph nodes or other parts of the body. Approximately 25% of women with ovarian cancer will be diagnosed at an early stage, thus the diagnosis often occurs due to an accidental finding. The intention of surgical staging is to establish a diagnosis, to assess the extent of the cancer and to remove as much tumour as possible. The latter is particularly important as women with ovarian cancer survive for longer when all visible tumour has been removed. 
Review questionWe conducted this review in an attempt to clarify whether laparoscopy (keyhole surgery) is as safe and effective as laparotomy (open surgery) for early‐stage ovarian cancer. We intended to include only high‐quality studies that compared the two types of surgery. We wanted to know whether women having laparoscopy survived as long as those having open surgery and whether there were differences in the time it took for the cancer to get worse. We were also interested to see how these different surgeries compared with regard to blood loss and other complications. 
Main findings and quality of the evidenceWe search the literature from 1990 to 2106. Unfortunately, we were unable to find any high‐quality randomised trials comparing these approaches.
