Chemotherapy, radiotherapy or both after surgery for treatment of a rare tumour of the ovary 
Ovarian carcinosarcoma (malignant mixed Mullerian tumour) is a rare malignant gynaecological tumour comprising around 1% or less of all ovarian cancers. These tumours contain both carcinomatous (arising from the epithelial tissue, the tissue that lines the cavities and surfaces of structures throughout the body) and sarcomatous tissue (arising from the connective tissue) within them. This tumour usually presents at an advanced stage and has a poor survival rate despite treatment. It is usually treated with a combination of surgery and chemotherapy, and sometimes radiotherapy. Various types of chemotherapy drugs have been used to treat the woman before and after surgery (neoadjuvant and adjuvant settings). 
There is currently no evidence to determine whether any form of chemotherapy or radiotherapy, or both, in combination with surgery is better or worse for prolonging survival and improving quality of life or toxicity. The review highlights the need for good quality studies comparing various chemotherapy regimens, both pre‐ and post‐surgery, with or without radiotherapy. Multicentre, multinational and collaborative good quality studies are needed to investigate this rare disease.
