Intermittent vascular occlusion is safe but does not decrease morbidity in liver resection
More than 1000 elective (planned operation) liver resections are performed annually in the United Kingdom alone. When liver resection is performed, the inflow of blood to the liver can be blocked (vascular occlusion), thereby reducing the blood loss. It is a controversial issue whether this causes more problems than solutions. We assessed the safety and effectiveness of vascular occlusion compared to no vascular occlusion in liver resection. We included five randomised clinical trials in this review. All trials had high risk of bias ('systematic error'). A total of 331 patients were randomised to vascular occlusion (n = 166) versus to no vascular occlusion (n = 165) in the five trials. The statistical analysis of the data demonstrates that intermittent vascular occlusion is a safe procedure, and that it reduces blood loss during operation. The trials did not demonstrate significant difference regarding mortality and liver failure, but data were sparse and more randomised trials seem to be needed.
