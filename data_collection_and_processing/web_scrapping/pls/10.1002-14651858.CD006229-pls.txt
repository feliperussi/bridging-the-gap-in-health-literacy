Laparoscopic and small‐incision cholecystectomy seem equivalent in complications and recovery, but small‐incision cholecystectomy is quicker to perform 
The laparoscopic and the small‐incision cholecystectomy are two alternative minimally invasive techniques for removal of the gallbladder. There are no significant differences in mortality and complications between the two minimal invasive procedures. The laparoscopic and the small‐incision operation should be considered equal apart from a quicker operative time using the small‐incision technique. The complications in both techniques are common.
