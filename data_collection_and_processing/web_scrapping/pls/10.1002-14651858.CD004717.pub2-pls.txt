Distraction techniques for schizophrenia
People with schizophrenia often suffer from hallucinations. Various forms of distraction from these hallucinations have been evaluated in trials, but reporting is poor, and the few studies are small and short. Although there is no evidence that they have a major effect, further trials are justified as some of these potentially simple techniques, even if their effect is negligible, could be widely implemented and prove more acceptable than other more intrusive treatments.
