Cryoplasty for peripheral vascular disease
Peripheral arterial disease results from narrowing or blocking of the main arteries to the legs, usually due to atherosclerosis. The resulting reduction of blood flow caused by a blocked or narrowed artery can either cause pain on walking or become so severe that loss of the leg is threatened. Endovascular surgery involves inserting a small balloon through a needle puncture into the affected artery. The balloon is then inflated to stretch the artery open (called percutaneous balloon angioplasty). Unfortunately the artery often narrows again over time, which is called restenosis. Cryoplasty cools the vessel wall at the same time as doing the balloon angioplasty and may reduce thickening of the inner muscular layer of the blood vessel to improve long‐term angioplasty results and prevent restenosis.  
The benefit of cryoplasty over conventional balloon angioplasty has yet to be definitely established as there are few randomised controlled trials evaluating this method. The technical success rates and rates of unobstructed arteries (primary patency) compared with conventional angioplasty seen in seven trials (478 patients) were inconsistent. Long‐term outcomes, in particular, are as yet to be assessed fully. Currently there are insufficient data to support the routine use of cryoplasty over conventional balloon angioplasty in the treatment of peripheral arterial disease.
