Topically applied anaesthetics for treating perineal pain after childbirth
Not enough evidence to say if local anaesthetics applied to the perineum help to relieve perineal pain after childbirth. 
The perineum is the area between a woman's vagina and rectum, which may be traumatised during childbirth following a tear or a surgical cut (episiotomy). Local anaesthetics are easy to use and inexpensive, but their effectiveness needs to be assessed. This review of trials found eight studies using a variety of anaesthetics. There were not enough data to say if they helped with pain, and long‐term effects were not assessed. More research is required to assess the effectiveness of topical anaesthetics on pain, longer‐term outcomes, relationships and quality of life, as well as the effectiveness of different topical anaesthetics.
