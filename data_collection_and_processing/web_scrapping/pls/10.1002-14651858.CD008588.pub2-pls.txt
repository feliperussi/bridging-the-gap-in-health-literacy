Chemotherapy (drug treatment) for inoperable thymic cancer in adults
Question: Which type and when should chemotherapy (drug treatment) be given to people with thymic carcinoma or advanced thymoma? 
Background: Thymic cancers are rare tumours arising in the thymus gland behind the breastbone in the chest cavity. For people with advanced‐stage thymic tumours complete surgical resection is normally not possible and the only treatment option is combined chemotherapy. This review aimed to assess the role of chemotherapy in people with advanced thymic tumours. 
Main findings: We did not identify any suitable clinical trials for inclusion in this review from our search (up to July 2012). We have reported details of prospective studies that are not suitable for inclusion in the review, which provide some useful evidence about current clinical practice. 
Quality of the evidence: While various treatment options are used, cisplatin‐based chemotherapy is currently the usual regimen of choice, however this is not supported by good‐quality trials.
