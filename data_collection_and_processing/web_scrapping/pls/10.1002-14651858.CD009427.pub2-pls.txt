Treatments with Viagra (Sildenafil citrate)  for erectile dysfunction in male patients aged more than 18 years old with multiple sclerosis 
Erectile dysfunction (ED) is a common sexual disease in male patients with multiple sclerosis (MS). Viagra (Sildenafil citrate) is considered as an effective drug for  the treatment of ED in the general population, but it has not been systematically reviewed in patients with MS. 
This review tried to assess its efficacy and safety in patients with MS. Among the pertinent literature, two studies, involving a total of 420 ED patients with MS, were identified. Both trials compared orally administered Viagra versus placebo up to 4‐12 weeks. 
The authors find limited evidence to support Viagra as an effective treatment to improve erectile function and quality of life at a short‐term follow up. Adverse events were also reported: the most common were headache, flushing, rhinitis, visual disturbances and dyspepsia, but two patients suffered serious adverse events during Viagra treatment including one with coronary artery disease requiring triple bypass surgery and one with a cerebrovascular accident.
