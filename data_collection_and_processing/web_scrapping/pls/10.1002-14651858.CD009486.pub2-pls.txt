Clonazepam for neuropathic pain and fibromyalgia in adults
Nerves which have been damaged by injury or disease can continue to produce pain. This type of pain is called neuropathic pain. Some antiepileptic medications can help neuropathic pain. Clonazepam is an antiepileptic medication, and the aim of this review was to assess how effective clonazepam is for neuropathic pain and fibromyalgia. We identified no good quality studies of clonazepam used in this situation. Dependence and tolerance may occur with prolonged use, although it is less of a problem with clonazepam than many other drugs from the same class (benzodiazepines), and behavioural disinhibition has been reported in a few patients with psychiatric problems. Based on current evidence, clonazepam cannot be recommended for treating neuropathic pain. Other antiepileptic drugs such as pregabalin, gabapentin, and carbamazepine have been shown to be of value in neuropathic pain.
