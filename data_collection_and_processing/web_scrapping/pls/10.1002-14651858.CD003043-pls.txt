Still awaiting evidence for effect of ursodeoxycholic acid and/or antibiotics in the prevention of biliary stent occlusion 
Malignant occlusion of the biliary tract can be relieved by insertion of a stent, which allows passage of the biliary fluid. However, stents often clog. This Review examines if ursodeoxycholic acid (a bile acid) and/or antibiotics may prevent clogging of biliary stents. At present there is not sufficient evidence to recommend ursodeoxycholic acid and/or antibiotics for biliary stented patients.
