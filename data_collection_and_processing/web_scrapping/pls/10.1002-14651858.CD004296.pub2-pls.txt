Triflusal for preventing serious vascular events in people at high risk
Triflusal is not clearly better than aspirin for preventing serious vascular events such as strokes, heart attacks and deaths from vascular disease. Triflusal and aspirin are drugs that prevent blood clots forming. When blood clots form in arteries and block the flow of blood, they can cause a stroke, heart attack or other serious circulatory problems. These are called serious vascular events. People who have had a stroke, a heart attack or symptoms of blood clots in other arteries are at high risk of experiencing further vascular events. There is strong evidence that in people who have had a vascular event, aspirin reduces the risk of further events. This review compared the effects of triflusal with aspirin in people who had had a vascular event. It did not find any evidence that triflusal was definitely better than aspirin for preventing further serious vascular events, although triflusal did seem to cause fewer bleeding complications than aspirin.
