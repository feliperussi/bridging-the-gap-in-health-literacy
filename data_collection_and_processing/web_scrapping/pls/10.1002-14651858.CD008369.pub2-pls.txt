Astragalus (a traditional Chinese medicine) for treating chronic kidney disease
Chronic kidney disease affects increasing numbers of people around the world, but as yet, effective strategies to control its progression have not been universally accepted. Astragalus is one of most widely used herbs for treating kidney disease. We conducted this review to evaluate the benefits and potential harms of Astragalus for the treatment of people with chronic kidney disease. 
We searched the literature published up to July 204 and summarised 22 studies involving 1323 people with chronic kidney disease, including both on dialysis treatment or not. 
Although we found some promising evidence suggesting that when given with conventional treatment, Astragalus may help to decrease the serum creatinine, reduce the amount of protein lost in urine and diminish the effects of some complications, such as anaemia and malnutrition, evidence quality was low. We found that errors and omissions in study methods and reporting were likely to have flawed results among the studies we assessed. Possible adverse effects associated with Astragalus injection should be noted, although we found no relevant reports from included studies.
