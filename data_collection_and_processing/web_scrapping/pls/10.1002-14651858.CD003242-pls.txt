Anticoagulants versus antiplatelet agents for acute ischaemic stroke
Treatment with anticoagulants offers no net advantages over antiplatelet agents in patients with acute ischaemic stroke. Ischaemic stroke is caused by a blood‐clot blocking the blood supply to an area of the brain. Blood‐thinning drugs, such as anticoagulants and antiplatelet agents, can potentially prevent arteries from being blocked, or prevent them re‐blocking. They can also prevent clots forming in the deep veins in the leg, which can break off and travel to the lungs. However, such drugs can also cause bleeding complications, which might offset any benefits. Antiplatelet agents (mainly aspirin) are associated with long‐term benefits and have become standard treatment for acute ischaemic stroke. This review aimed to test whether any anticoagulant regimen offers net advantages over antiplatelet agents, overall, or in specific categories of patients. There was no evidence that anticoagulants are superior to antiplatelet agents (in fact, anticoagulants caused a small increase in the number of deaths at long‐term follow‐up). However, the combination of low‐dose anticoagulant and aspirin seemed to offer benefits over aspirin alone, and the combination should be investigated further.
