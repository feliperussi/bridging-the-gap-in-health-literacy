Not enough evidence is available to prove that hormonal contraceptives do not influence glucose and fat metabolism in women with diabetes mellitus 
It is important for both women with diabetes mellitus type 1 and type 2 to receive good advice which contraceptive method is best to use. Unplanned pregnancies can lead to serious health issues for both mother and child in women with diabetes. Yet, hormonal contraceptives have been reported to influence glucose and fat metabolism. In this review, both progestogen‐only methods (pills and an intrauterine device) and low‐dose combined oral contraceptives appeared to have only minor influences on glucose and fat metabolism. However only four studies, most of limited quality, examining a small number of women were included in this review. Only one of the studies reported on true clinical endpoints that is micro‐ and macrovascular disease. It found no signs or symptoms of thromboembolic incidents or visual disturbances. However this trial was performed over a short period of time. Therefore no definite conclusions can be made based on this review. Future trials analysing glucose and fat metabolism as well as long‐term complications for all available contraceptive methods are needed.
