Compression hosiery (stockings) for preventing venous leg ulcers returning
Venous leg ulcers (open wounds on the lower leg) can be caused by a blockage or breakdown in the veins of the legs. Compression, using bandages or hosiery (stockings), can help heal most of these ulcers and is also widely used after healing to prevent ulcers returning. One small trial confirms that compression reduces ulcer recurrence compared with no compression. There is some evidence that people wearing high rather than moderate‚Äêcompression hosiery are less likely to get a new ulcer. It is not clear whether moderate strength hosiery is better tolerated than high compression. There is, therefore, some evidence that compression hosiery might prevent ulcers, but the evidence is not strong.
