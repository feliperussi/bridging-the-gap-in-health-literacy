Oral antifungal drugs for treating athlete's foot (tinea pedis)
Athlete's foot (tinea pedis) is a fungal infection of the feet that is easily spread and difficult to get rid of. This review compared different oral antifungal drugs (i.e. drugs taken by mouth), and it included 15 trials, involving 1438 participants. There are several different kinds of oral treatments, and the trials we found considered all the oral drugs used to treat athlete's foot. We found terbinafine and itraconazole to be more effective than placebo. And we found terbinafine to be more effective than griseofulvin. Griseofulvin is a treatment that was developed much earlier than the new treatments, such as terbinafine and itraconazole; these newer treatments tend to be most evaluated. Trials of other drugs were not large enough to show differences between them. All drugs had side‚Äêeffects; gastrointestinal effects were the most common. 
In future clinical trials, larger numbers of participants are needed to test different treatments in order to produce more reliable data. Also, future research should consider the costs of the different treatment approaches.
