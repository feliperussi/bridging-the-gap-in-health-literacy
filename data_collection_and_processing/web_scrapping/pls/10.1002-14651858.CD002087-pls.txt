Tirilazad for acute ischaemic stroke
Tirilazad is not effective for acute ischaemic stroke. Tirilazad is a drug which in animal models of stroke protects brain tissue and reduces brain damage. However, when studied in man, tirilazad not only did not improve outcome after stroke, but appeared to marginally worsen it. It has no role in the clinical treatment of stroke.
