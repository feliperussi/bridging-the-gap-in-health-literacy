Screening with urinary dipsticks for reducing morbidity and mortality
Urinary dipsticks are sometimes used for screening healthy people and patients that do not have symptoms of urinary disease. Urinary dipsticks can be used to test for several different substances, such as blood, sugar, protein, white blood cells and nitrite in the urine, which may indicate the presence of disease. Identified abnormalities sometimes lead to additional investigations, which may identify serious disease, such as bladder cancer and chronic kidney disease. Detection could improve health outcomes from finding disease at earlier stages, but could also lead to unnecessary follow‚Äêup testing, which may be invasive, and lead to unnecessary treatment. 
We searched the literature to September 2014 to identify studies that compared urinary dipstick screening with no dipstick screening. However, we found no studies that met our inclusion criteria. We were unable to determine benefits and harms associated with urinary dipstick screening.
