Treatments to fight fungal infections that cause allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis in people with cystic fibrosis 
Review question 
We planned to review the evidence about the effect of treatments to fight fungal infections that cause allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA) in people with cystic fibrosis. 
Background 
ABPA is an allergic lung reaction to a type of fungus (usually Aspergillus fumigatus) in some people with cystic fibrosis. It causes a cough and wheezing, and sometimes fever. If left untreated, ABPA can lead to long‐term lung damage. It is usually treated with a high dose of corticosteroids (also known as steroids). However, it has not been proven that corticosteroids can prevent lung function from deteriorating in the long term. Also, long‐term use of corticosteroids is linked to some serious side effects. Treating the fungus that causes ABPA may be an alternative to using high doses of corticosteroids to combat the allergic reaction. This is an update of a previously published review. 
Search date 
The evidence is current to 28 September 2021.
Study characteristics 
We did not find any trials that we could include in the review.
Key results 
There is currently no evidence to recommend the use of antifungal treatment in people with cystic fibrosis and ABPA. 
We need trials to assess the effects of corticosteroids in this population in the long and the short term.
