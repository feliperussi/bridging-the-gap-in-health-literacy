Training and supportive programs for palliative care volunteers in community settings
The use of volunteers in community palliative care services can extend the range of activities offered to support people who are terminally ill. The types of training and support for volunteers are likely to affect their effectiveness and influence the quality of care provided to people requiring palliative care and their families. Training and support may also be costly for palliative care organisations. Â  
The objective of this review was to assess the effects of training and support strategies for palliative care volunteers on people requiring palliative care and their families, volunteers and service quality. Despite extensive searching we found no studies that we could include. Research is needed on the impact of training and support for palliative care volunteers on patients, their families, volunteers and palliative care services.
