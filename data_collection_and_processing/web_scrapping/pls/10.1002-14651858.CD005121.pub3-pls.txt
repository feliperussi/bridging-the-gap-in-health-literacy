Anakinra for Rheumatoid Arthritis
This summary of a Cochrane review presents what we know from research about the effect of Anakrina on rheumatoid arthritis (RA). 
The review shows that in people with RA, 
Taking Anakrina for 6 months may improve RA symptoms such as pain, function, and stiffness.
What are RA and Anakrina? 
When you have rheumatoid arthritis, your immune system, which normally fights infection, attacks the lining of your joints. This makes your joints swollen, stiff and painful. The small joints of your hands and feet are usually affected first. There is no cure for RA at present, so the treatments aim to relieve pain and stiffness and improve your ability to move.   
Anakinra is an interleukin‐1 receptor antagonist which is a drug that blocks the inflammatory protein interleukin‐1. The drug is used to slow the progression of moderate to severe active RA in patients over age 18 who have not responded to one or more of  the disease‐modifying anti‐rheumatic drugs (DMARD).  Anakrina can be used with other RA drugs. 
Best estimate of what happens to people with RA who take Anakrina: 
23 out of 100 people experienced improvement of RA symptoms such as pain, function, and stiffness when taking a placebo 
38 out of 100 people experienced improvement of RA symptoms such as pain, function, and stiffness when taking Anakrina 
15 more people out of 100 experienced improvement of RA symptoms after taking Anakrina for 6 months compared with taking a placebo.
