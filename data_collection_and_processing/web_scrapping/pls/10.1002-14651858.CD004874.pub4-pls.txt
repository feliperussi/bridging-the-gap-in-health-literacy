Different antibiotics for community‐acquired pneumonia in otherwise healthy children younger than 18 years of age in hospital and outpatient settings 
Pneumonia is the leading cause of mortality in children under five years of age. Most cases of community‐acquired pneumonia (CAP) in low‐income countries are caused by bacteria. This systematic review identified 29 randomised controlled trials from many different countries enrolling 14,188 children and comparing antibiotics for treatment of CAP in children. Most were single studies only. 
We found that for outpatient treatment of pneumonia, amoxycillin is an alternative treatment to co‐trimoxazole. Oral amoxycillin in children with severe pneumonia without hypoxia (i.e. a decreased level of oxygen), and who are feeding well, may be effective. For very severe pneumonia, a combination of penicillin or ampicillin and gentamycin is more effective than chloramphenicol alone. Reports of adverse events were not available in many studies. Wherever information on adverse events was available, it did not differ between two drugs compared except that gastrointestinal side effects were more commonly reported with erythromycin compared to azithromycin. 
Limitations of this review are that only five studies met all the quality assessment criteria and for most comparisons of the efficacy of antibiotics only one or two studies were available.
