Raising haemoglobin (red blood cell) levels above 133 g/L in people with heart and kidney disease does not reduce mortality, and may even increase it 
Having too few red blood cells (anaemia) makes a person feel tired and unwell. Blood transfusions or drugs can be given to increase red blood cell levels (haemoglobin). Having too many red blood cells can lead to blockages in catheters and other vascular access for patients on dialysis. It can also cause high blood pressure. This review of clinical studies found that increasing haemoglobin to high levels lowered the chance of a person having a seizure, but increased blood pressure. Haemoglobin levels above 133 g/L did not reduce the risk of death in people with heart and kidney disease.
