Covering ileo‐ or colostomy in anterior resection for rectal carcinoma is associated with less anastomotic leakage, but does not offer advantage in term of 30 days or long term mortality. 
Anastomotic leak is a breakdown of a suture line in a surgical anastomosis with a consequent leakage of intestinal fluid, following surgical intervention. Anastomotic leak is one the most significant complications that occur after performing a surgical intervention for rectal cancer. Anastomotic leak may increase morbidity, mortality and the duration of hospital stay. Use of a covering stoma may prevent the occurrence of anastomotic leak. This review assessed 6 randomised trials and found that the rate of anastomotic leak is significantly lower with the use of a covering stoma. However, there is no evidence that mortality can be reduced by using a covering stoma. 
The value of this review is limited by the low methodological quality of the included trials and the absence of data about long‐term results.
