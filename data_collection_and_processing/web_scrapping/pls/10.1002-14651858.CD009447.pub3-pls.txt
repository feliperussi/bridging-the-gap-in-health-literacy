Blood thinners for the prevention of blood clots in people with cancer undergoing surgery 
Background People with cancer undergoing surgery are at an increased risk of blood clots. Blood thinners (anticoagulants) administered to prevent these clots include unfractionated heparin (UFH) infused intravenously (into a vein), low‚Äêmolecular weight heparin (LMWH) injected subcutaneously (under the skin) once or twice per day, and fondaparinux. These blood thinners may have different effectiveness and safety profiles. 
Study characteristics We searched scientific databases for clinical trials looking at the effects of blood thinners on death, pulmonary embolism (blood clot in the lungs), deep vein thrombosis (blood clot in the veins of the legs), bruising, bleeding, and need for blood transfusion in people with cancer having operations. We included trials of adults and children of any age or sex with either solid tumors or blood cancer irrespective of the type of cancer treatment. The evidence is current to 14 June 2018. 
Key results We found 20 studies that included 9771 people with cancer. The evidence did not identify any difference between the effects of LMWH and UFH on death, getting a blood clot, or bleeding. There was less bruising around the wound following the operation with LMWH compared with UFH. Fondaparinux may have reduced the risk of getting a blood clot. 
Reliability of evidence The reliability of evidence varied from low to moderate across the outcomes of interest.
