Surgery for urinary incontinence due to presumed sphincter deficiency after prostate surgery 
Background 
Urinary leakage (incontinence) after surgery to remove the prostate (prostatectomy) for benign or malignant disease is a well‐known and often feared outcome. Although a small amount of incontinence may not cause a problem, larger degrees of incontinence can have a major impact on a man's quality of life. Improvement in urinary leakage may occur six to 12 months after the prostatic surgery, but for men with persistent bothersome leakage despite conservative therapy such as pelvic floor exercises, surgery may be offered. 
Study characteristics 
We searched scientific databases for trials that had considered the effectiveness of the surgical treatments of urinary incontinence after prostate surgery in men. The trials had to compare surgical treatment versus no treatment, non‐surgical treatment, or another surgical treatment. The evidence is current to April 2014. 
Key results and quality of the evidence 
There are five main types of surgery and, despite some of them being in use since the 1990s, we found only one trial that met the inclusion criteria. There was very low quality evidence that the implantation of an artificial urinary sphincter (a manufactured device to prevent urine leaking out) might be more effective than injectable treatment, but with more adverse effects and higher costs. There was no evidence about the other types of surgery.
