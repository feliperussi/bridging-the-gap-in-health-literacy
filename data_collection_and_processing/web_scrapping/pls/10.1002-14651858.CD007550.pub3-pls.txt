Single dose oral dexibuprofen for acute postoperative pain in adults
Acute pain is often felt soon after injury. Most people who have surgery have moderate or severe pain afterwards. People with pain are used to test pain killers. They have often had wisdom teeth removed. The pain is often treated with pain killers given by mouth. Results can be applied to other forms of acute pain. 
A series of reviews looks at how good pain killers are. This review looks at a drug called dexibuprofen. This is a form of ibuprofen. It is thought to give the same pain relief at a lower dose. 
We found two clinical trials with 313 people. Dexibuprofen at 200 mg or 400 mg single doses probably produced useful pain relief. The small number of studies, and of people in them, meant that no sensible results about benefit or harm after taking the drug were available.Â
