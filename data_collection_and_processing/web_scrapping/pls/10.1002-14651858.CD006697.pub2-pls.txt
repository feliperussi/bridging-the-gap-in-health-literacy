Interventions for replacing missing teeth: management of soft tissues for dental implants
Dental implants are usually placed by elevating a soft tissue flap, but in some instances, they can also be placed without flap elevation to reduce postoperative discomfort. Several flap and suturing techniques have been proposed. Soft tissues are often manipulated and augmented for aesthetic reasons. It is often recommended that implants are surrounded by 'firm' (attached/keratinised) soft tissues rather than 'movable' gums to improve their long‐term prognosis. The review found some weak evidence from only two studies with 56 patients that flapless placement of dental implants reduces postoperative discomfort (pain and swelling), without jeopardising implant success in selected patients. There is insufficient evidence to recommend any specific flap or suturing technique. There is only a small study (10 patients) suggesting that soft tissue grafts from the palate improve gum thickness and aesthetics. There are no studies evaluating whether there is a benefit in increasing the amount of firm gum surrounding dental implants but there is a small trial suggesting that it is possible to increase the amount of firm gum surrounding dental implants using either tissue taken from the palate or a porcine‐derived collagen matrix at the price of considerable postoperative pain/discomfort and aesthetic deterioration (there were several cases where the gum receded exposing the metal of the implant).
