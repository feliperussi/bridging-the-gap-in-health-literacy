Extra‐abdominal versus intra‐abdominal repair of the uterine incision at caesarean section 
There is not enough evidence to say if closing the cut in the womb after caesarean section is better done within the abdomen or outside. 
In order to perform a caesarean section, the mother's abdomen and then the uterus need to be cut in order for the baby to be born. These cuts then need to be stitched up (sutured). It has been suggested that it might be easier to bring the uterus outside the abdomen in order to suture it and then return it to its place, rather than suturing it in position. The review of six trials found that there was not enough evidence to say if this was better for the mother or not. More research is needed.
