Memantine for dementia in people with Down syndrome
Memantine is thought to improve cognitive function and slow the decline of AD over time.The effects of memantine on AD are reported to be beneficial for people with moderate to severe AD in the general population, However, people with DS tend to present with AD at a much younger age than the general population as well as being physically different in terms of size, metabolism and heart rate, and may therefore have different requirements. Results from the one randomised controlled trial for the treatment of dementia in DS are not yet available (expected 2009). 
This review was superseded by a new review titled 'Pharmacological interventions for cognitive decline in people with Down syndrome' in the CDSR in 2015.
