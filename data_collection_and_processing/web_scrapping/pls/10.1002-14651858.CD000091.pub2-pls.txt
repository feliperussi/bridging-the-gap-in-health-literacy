Fibrinogen depleting agents may help to remove blood clots in acute ischaemic stroke
Fibrinogen depleting agents are promising but unproven for acute ischaemic stroke. Most strokes are due to a blood clot blocking an artery in the brain. Fibrinogen depleting agents may help remove the blood clot to restore the blood supply to the brain and so improve the chance of making a recovery from the stroke. Fibrinogen depleting agents also reduce blood thickness (or viscosity), which also helps to improve blood flow to the brain. However, these agents can also cause serious bleeding in the brain. Evidence from this updated review, which includes eight trials involving 5701 participants, indicates that there is currently not sufficient evidence to support the routine use of fibrinogen depleting agents for the treatment of acute ischaemic stroke. Further trials are needed to determine reliably whether there is worthwhile benefit, and if so, which categories of patients are most likely to benefit.
