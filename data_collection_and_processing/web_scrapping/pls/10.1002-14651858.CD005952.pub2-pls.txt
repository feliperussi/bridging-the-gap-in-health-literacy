Therapy‐based rehabilitation services for patients living at home more than one year after stroke 
It is unclear if rehabilitation provided more than one year after a stroke can improve recovery. People who are recovering from a stroke for one year or more often have persistent disabilities. Although therapy‐based rehabilitation for such patients is an accepted part of stroke management, the evidence base for such practice is unclear. We identified only five clinical trials, including 487 participants, which showed a tendency towards improved recovery but the results were inconclusive.
