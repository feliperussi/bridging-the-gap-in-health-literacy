Doxapram for ventilatory failure due to exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease 
Some people with advanced COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) experience respiratory failure whereby blood oxygen levels fall and high levels of the waste gas carbon dioxide accumulate and cause worsening symptoms. In extreme cases this disturbance in the blood can cause coma and death. When respiratory failure is severe giving oxygen alone is no longer enough because an increase in carbon dioxide levels can make the situation worse by depressing the drive to breathe. Doxapram is a drug that may stimulate breathing. The review of trials found that it may be able to help, but some newer treatments may be more effective. Doxapram may be worthwhile as a short‚Äêterm measure or when other treatments are not possible.
