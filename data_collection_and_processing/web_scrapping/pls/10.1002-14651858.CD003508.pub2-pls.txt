The majority of children with HIV infection live in low‐income countries without access to antiretroviral drugs. The prevention and early treatment of opportunistic infections are the mainstay of their medical management. Cotrimoxazole is cheap and effective against a wide range of organisms, including Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia (PCP), which is an important cause of death and illness in the first year of life. It is safe with relatively few side effects. 
One study fulfilled the inclusion criteria for this review. This was a well‐conducted trial of good methodological quality. It shows a significant reduction in mortality in children between the ages of 1 and 15 years, taking cotrimoxazole in comparison to placebo. Using cotrimoxazole in HIV‐infected children waiting for antiretroviral treatment, or not yet requiring it, may increase survival and reduce the number of days spent in hospital.
