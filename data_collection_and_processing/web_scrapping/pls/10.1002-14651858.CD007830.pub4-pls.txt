Treadmill training for people with Parkinson's disease
Question: We assessed whether treadmill training and body weight support, individually or in combination, could improve walking in people with Parkinson's disease when compared with other gait training methods or no treatment. 
Background:Slow walking is a common problem for people with Parkinson's disease. For people with mild to moderate Parkinsons disease it affects ability to do everyday things and their quality of life. Treadmill training uses specially designed machines to help gait rehabilitation. However, the role of treadmill training for people with Parkinson's disease in improving gait parameters is still unclear. 
Study characteristics: We identified 18 relevant trials, involving 633 participants which evaluated this type of therapy, up to September 2014. 
Key results and quality of the evidence: Treadmill training did improve gait speed, and stride length; but walking distance and cadence did not improve. Acceptability of treadmill training for study participants was good and adverse events were rare. It seems that such devices could be beneficial and could be applied in routine rehabilitation. However, it is still not clear when and how often they should be used and how long a benefit lasts. 
The quality of this evidence for the primary outcomes was moderate to low. Adverse events were not reported in studies and drop outs did not occur more frequently in people receiving treadmill training. Also we investigated only gait parameters, improvements of activities and/or quality of life were not investigated.
