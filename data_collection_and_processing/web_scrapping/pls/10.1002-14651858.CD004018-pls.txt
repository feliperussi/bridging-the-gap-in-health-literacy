Working wrist splints and extra‐depth shoes appear to be helpful for people with rheumatoid arthritis 
Ten studies examined the effects of working wrist splints, resting hand and wrist splints, and wearing special shoes/ insoles in people with rheumatoid arthritis. Although there is no evidence that wearing resting wrist and hand splints changed pain, grip strength, or number of swollen joints, participants who wore these splints for two months preferred to wear them, and also preferred padded splints. One study provided evidence that wearing extra‐depth shoes for two months resulted in significant benefits of less pain on walking and stair climbing. Extra‐depth shoes with semi‐rigid insoles provided better pain relief than extra‐depth shoes alone.
