There is currently no evidence to determine the best way to treat Mandrax dependence in adults. 
Dependence and abuse of methaqualone, a type of sedative‐hypnotic, is a major public health problem in parts of Africa and India. Treatment is highly variable and takes place in both in‐patient and out‐patient settings. Despite an extensive search of electronic databases, the internet, relevant conferences and contact with experts in the field, this review identified no randomised controlled trials of the effectiveness of treatment for Mandrax dependence and/or abuse. Currently no evidence exists for using one type of treatment over another.
