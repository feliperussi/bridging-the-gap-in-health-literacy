Not enough evidence to show which surgical technique is preferable for internal fixation of intracapsular hip fractures 
Hip fractures located within the hip joint capsule (intracapsular hip fractures) may be surgically fixed using a variety of different implants and surgical techniques. This review examines the effects of different surgical techniques. It found insufficient evidence from randomised trials to assess the effects of compression or of impaction of the fracture during surgery. It found limited evidence that open reduction (surgically exposed) as compared with closed reduction (under X‚Äêray control) resulted in a greater length of surgery. The lack of evidence showing benefit of open reduction supports the use of closed reduction of these fractures.
