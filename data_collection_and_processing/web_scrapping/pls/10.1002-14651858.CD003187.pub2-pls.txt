Second malignancy risk in Hodgkin's disease patients depends upon the choice of chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy as first‐line treatment. 
Hodgkin's disease (HD) patients are usually treated initially with radiotherapy alone (RT; early stages only), chemotherapy alone (CT) or combined chemo‐radiotherapy (CRT). A meta‐analysis of data from 37 randomised trials including over 9000 patients was conducted. For early‐stage patients, CRT resulted in longer survival and longer HD‐free survival than either RT or CT alone. Second malignancy (SM) risk was lower with CRT than with RT (no difference in between CRT and CT was demonstrated). For advanced stages, no difference in survival between CRT and CT was established. With CRT, HD‐free survival was longer but SM risk was higher.
