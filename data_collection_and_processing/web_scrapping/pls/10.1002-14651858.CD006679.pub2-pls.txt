The effects of anaesthetic agents on cortical mapping during neurosurgical procedures involving eloquent areas of the brain 
There are discrete areas in the brain that are responsible for sensation (sensory), control of movement (motor) and language functions. In patients with surgically removable lesions involving, or adjacent to, these areas, it is important to achieve a near complete resection without damaging the functional areas (normal brain tissue). Electrical properties of the brain cells are often monitored during these surgical procedures to accurately identify the functional areas. This technique is called electrophysiological mapping. Anaesthetic agents are known to affect the mapping techniques. The authors of this review aimed to identify and evaluate randomised controlled trials (RCTS) assessing the effect of anaesthetic agents on electrophysiological mapping of these functional areas of the brain. We were not able to find any RCTs. Good quality evidence is lacking and hence there is a need for well‚Äêdesigned RCTs to determine the effects of anaesthetic agents on electrophysiological mapping in this specific surgical population.
