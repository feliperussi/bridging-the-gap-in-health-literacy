Single dose oral sulindac for acute postoperative pain in adults
Pain is commonly experienced after surgical procedures. Postoperative pain is a good model to test whether or not drugs are effective painkillers in participants with moderate or severe pain. In this case we could find no studies that tested oral sulindac against placebo. It is possible that the studies were done, but not reported, because they were used only to register sulindac with licensing authorities throughout the world. However, this leaves an important gap in our knowledge, and it means that we cannot be confident about using oral sulindac for acute painful conditions.
