Treatments for the management of CMV‐associated anterior segment inflammation
What is the aim of this review?  The aim of this Cochrane review was to find out what is the best way to treat inflammation of the eye due to cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection. Cochrane review authors searched for all relevant studies (randomised controlled trials) but did not find any studies that could be included in the review. 
Key messages  There were no randomised controlled trials of treatment of CMV‐associated inflammation of the eye. 
What was studied in the review?  Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is a virus that affects the front of the eye. If the CMV infection is not treated, it can cause irreversible damage to the front of the eye or damage to the optic nerve or both. This damage can cause sight loss. Untreated, this virus has a tendency to recur, and multiple recurrences can increase the chance of developing eye problems. The treatment for this virus includes the use of eyedrops as well as tablets and injections. However, the currently available medications have side effects, so that knowing the dose and duration of treatment can help reduce these side effects, as well as reducing the risk of new episodes and of further problems. 
What are the main results of the review?  The Cochrane review authors did not find any studies that met the inclusion criteria for the review. 
How up‐to‐date is this review?  The Cochrane review authors searched for studies that had been published up to 21 March 2017.
