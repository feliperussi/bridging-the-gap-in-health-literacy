Antipsychotic drugs for elderly people with late‐onset schizophrenia
A significant proportion of the world's growing elderly population suffers from schizophrenia that started very late in life. Antipsychotic drugs are often used to treat this distressing and severe illness. In this review we attempted to find good quality trial‐based evidence to support this practice but found none. Currently this vulnerable group is not well served by the research community.
