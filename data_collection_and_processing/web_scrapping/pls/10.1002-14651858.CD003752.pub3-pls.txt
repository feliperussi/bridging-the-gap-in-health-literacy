Chemoradiation in locally advanced vulval cancer
In women with locally advanced vulval cancer (vulval cancer extending to urethra, vagina, perineum, anus, bladder, rectum, fixed to bones and enlarged fixed lymph glands) there was no significant difference in overall survival or treatment‚Äêrelated adverse events when primary chemoradiation or neoadjuvant chemoradiation (chemoradiation followed by less radical surgery) were compared with primary surgery. Women requiring extensive surgery (urinary and or feacal stoma formation) or with inoperable tumour were predominantly given primary chemoradiation in the two retrospective studies identified, making the available evidence weak (although we only included studies that used statistical adjustment). There was no data on quality of life. There is a great need for good quality studies comparing various primary treatments in locally advanced vulval cancer which are either inoperable at presentation or operable but would require extensive surgery.
