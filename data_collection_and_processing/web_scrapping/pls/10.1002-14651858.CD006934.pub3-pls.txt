Blind stretching or telescopic cutting versus open surgery for urethral narrowing in men 
Narrowing of the urine pipe (urethral stricture) is a common cause of problems in passing water for younger men. Standard treatment consists of widening the strictured segment using instruments passed down the urethra (called urethral dilatation or urethrotomy). Alternatively, a urethroplasty operation can be performed whereby the narrowed area is removed or replaced by graft material. The uncertainty as to which option is best prompted this review of the current evidence. We found very little good quality evidence and were unable to achieve all our objectives for this review. The results of a single study suggest that dilatation and urethrotomy offer equivalent outcomes, but they are associated with a high rate of recurrence of the stricture requiring repeated procedures over a relatively short period of time. Preliminary data reported in abstract form suggested that urethroplasty was more effective than urethrotomy for the specific circumstance of urethral trauma following fracture of the pelvic bones. We found no data concerning well‐being or the quality of life amongst men treated for urethral stricture disease. The main conclusion of the review is that the current lack of quality evidence means that further trials are needed to establish which intervention is most effective and most cost‐effective for treatment of urethral stricture disease in men.
