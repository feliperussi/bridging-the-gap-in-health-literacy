Surgery for choanal atresia
Congenital (present from birth) choanal atresia is a rare abnormality characterized by narrowing or blockage of one or both sides of the nasal airway. It has an incidence of between 1 in 5000 and 1 in 8000 births and is two times more common in females. Choanal atresia is treated by surgery, which aims to open the nasal airway sufficiently, avoid harm to any structure in development and result in a low rate of restenosis (renarrowing) after the operation. The procedure should ideally enable the shortest possible surgery and hospitalization time, and minimize morbidity and mortality. Many different techniques and approaches have been described. 
We looked for randomized controlled trials which have studied the effects of any surgical procedure for choanal atresia (one or both sides) in patients of any age. Our searches retrieved 46 reports of studies which had tested surgical approaches. However, we excluded all of them during the final selection process because their study designs did not meet the inclusion criteria for this review (i.e. they were not randomized controlled trials). There is therefore no definitive evidence, based on adequate studies, to demonstrate the potential advantages and disadvantages of any specific surgical technique for patients with choanal atresia over other techniques. Specialists should unify their efforts in multicenter randomized controlled trials testing the effectiveness and safety of different surgical techniques for patients with choanal atresia.
