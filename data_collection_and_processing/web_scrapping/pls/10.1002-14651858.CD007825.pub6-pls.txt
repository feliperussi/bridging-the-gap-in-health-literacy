Collaboration between local health and local government agencies for health improvement
Since the 1980s, national and international health organisations have promoted partnerships between health and other public services at a local level to improve the health of the population. This review looked for evidence on whether collaboration does or does not work when compared to standard services. 
Of the two good quality studies identified, one showed no evidence that collaboration between local services improved health and the other showed a modest improvement in some areas. Of the remaining studies, where health benefits were reported these were often modest, inconsistent with other findings and could have been the result of additional funding or resources. Two out of three studies looking at environmental changes reported some health benefits. 
These findings show that when comparing local collaborative partnerships between health and government agencies with standard working arrangements, there is generally no difference in health outcomes.
