Systemic antifungal drugs for invasive fungal infection in preterm infants
Preterm and sick newborn infants are at risk of serious infections of the blood, brain and kidneys due to fungi such as Candida (the organism that causes thrush). Severe fungal infections are associated with high death rates and with long‚Äêterm brain damage in newborn infants. A variety of different types of drugs for treating fungal infections are available. However, this systematic review found only very limited evidence (one small trial) to support the use of one type of antifungal drug over another. Until this uncertainty is resolved with new large trials, clinicians may continue to base their choice of antifungal agent on data extrapolated from studies in older children and adults.
