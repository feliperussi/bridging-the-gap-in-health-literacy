Crisis interventions for people with borderline personality disorder
Borderline personality disorder (BPD) is a complex and severe mental disorder that affects approximately 2% of the general population. Many people with BPD experience considerable instability in their interpersonal relationships and sense of who they are, leading to frequent crises and acts of self harm. To date, little is known about what might help people with BPD when they are experiencing an acute crisis. In this review, we wanted to examine how effective crisis interventions are for people with BPD by looking at evidence from randomised controlled trials (RCTs). 
We did not identify any completed studies that met the inclusion criteria. As there is inadequate evidence, we could not reach any conclusions about the management of acute crises in people with BPD. Given that crises in this population may be associated with an increased risk of suicide, further research is needed.
