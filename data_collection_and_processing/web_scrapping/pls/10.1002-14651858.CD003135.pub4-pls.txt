Fluticasone versus placebo for chronic asthma in adults and children
Fluticasone is a well‚Äêestablished inhaled steroid for use a preventative agent in controlling asthma symptoms. This review found that it is highly effective even in low doses. The effect does appear to increase with higher doses, but these improvements are small. This drug is associated with symptoms such a thrush, sore throat and hoarseness and these get worse with higher doses. In people with severe asthma who need oral steroid tablets to control their asthma, it can reduce the dose of oral steroids they need and improve their asthma at the same time. However, high or very high doses are needed for this effect. The drug appears to work in children and adults.
