Moxibustion for alleviating side effects of chemotherapy or radiotherapy in people with cancer 
The issue Moxibustion is used in traditional Chinese medicine to enhance quality of life and relieve the side effects of conventional treatments for a variety of diseases. As its application involves the burning of a herbal preparation, it can also cause some undesirable side effects itself, such as allergic reactions, burns and infection. 
The aim of the review We conducted this systematic review to understand whether moxibustion can reduce common side effects of chemotherapy and radiotherapy and improve well‐being in people with cancer. 
Selection criteria We reviewed 29 studies involving 2569 people with different types of cancer, receiving chemotherapy, radiotherapy or both. 
What are the main findings? We found some small single studies showing various beneficial effects of moxibustion on increasing blood cells and promoting immunological function, decreasing gastrointestinal symptoms caused by toxicity of chemotherapy or radiotherapy (such as nausea and vomiting), and improving quality of life. However, the poor reporting and high risk of bias in study methods reduced the certainty of the evidence. 
What is the certainty of the evidence? The evidence was of low or very low‐certainty. 
What are the conclusions? There is presently no good evidence to support or oppose the use of moxibustion in people receiving treatment for cancer. High‐quality studies are needed, which should include reporting of adverse effects.
