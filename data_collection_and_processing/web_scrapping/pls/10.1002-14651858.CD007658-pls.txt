Rivastigmine for dementia in people with Down syndrome
The drug rivastigmine has been reported to have benefits for people with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease who do not have Down syndrome. However, people with DS tend to present with AD at a much younger age than the general population as well as being physically different in terms of size, metabolism and heart rate, and may therefore have different requirements. This review identified no randomised controlled trials of rivastigmine in people with Down syndrome. Further research is needed. 
This review was superseded by a new review titled 'Pharmacological interventions for cognitive decline in people with Down syndrome' in the CDSR in 2015.
