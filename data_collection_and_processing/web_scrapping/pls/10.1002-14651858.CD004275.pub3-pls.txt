Additional bedtime medication for the control of night‐time acid reflux from the stomach.
The inhibition of gastric acid secretion is an accepted treatment for diseases related to reflux of acid from the stomach. Some types of antacids, known as proton pump inhibitors (PPI), are considered to be the most effective medical treatment for people patients with acid‐related diseases such as peptic ulcer, gastro‐oesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and Zollinger‐Ellison syndrome, but they may not reduce gastric acid secretion sufficiently to prevent night‐time acid reflux symptoms. H2‐receptor antagonists (H2RAs) have also been used for the treatment of acid‐related diseases for more than a decade and might help to control night‐time acid reflux, if taken at bedtime along with a high dose of PPI. The results show that additional bedtime H2RAs can decrease the night‐time gastric acid breakthrough, but we believe that additional bedtime H2RAs to PPI should only be used as treatment an intervention in clinical trials until further evidence has been found.
