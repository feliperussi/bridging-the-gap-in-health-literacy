Y‐set and double bag systems offer the most protection against peritonitis during continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) 
People with advanced kidney disease may be treated with CAPD where a catheter is permanently inserted into the peritoneum (lining around abdominal contents) through the abdominal wall and sterile fluid is drained in and out a few times each day. The most common serious complication is infection of the peritoneum ‐ peritonitis. This may be caused by bacteria accidentally being transferred from the catheter. This review of trials compared three types of connecting systems (used to connect the bags and the catheter) and found the Y‐set and double bag exchange systems are the most effective in preventing peritonitis.
