Non‐removable pressure‐relieving interventions help to heal foot ulcers in people with diabetes 
Foot ulceration is a complication of diabetes and can lead to amputation. Ulcers can occur due, in part, to abnormal pressures on the sole of the foot. The studies included in this review compared non‐removable pressure‐relieving interventions (foot casts) with other ways of relieving pressure on the ulcer site to improve healing. The comparisons included dressings alone, temporary therapeutic shoes, removable pressure‐relieving devices and surgical intervention. The review found that the non‐removable interventions were more effective than any of the other external pressure‐relieving methods. Non‐removable casts used with Achilles tendon lengthening were more successful in one forefoot ulcer study than using a non‐removable cast alone.
