Oral paliperidone for schizophrenia
Paliperidone, 9‐hydroxy‐risperidone, is an active metabolite of risperidone that is now commercially available in an oral formulation. We evaluated the efficacy, adverse effects, and safety of oral paliperidone in the treatment of people with schizophrenia and schizophrenia‐like illnesses. In short‐term studies, oral paliperidone is a more effective antipsychotic than placebo. The adverse effects of paliperidone are similar to those of risperidone. No data comparing the efficacy of paliperidone to risperidone over a meaningful period of time was available for this review; in a six‐day trial comparing paliperidone to risperidone we identified no difference in recurrence of psychotic symptoms or adverse effects. The manufacturer is also developing an intramuscular long‐acting formulation, but it is not yet commercially available; its use in the treatment of schizophrenia will be considered in a separate review.
