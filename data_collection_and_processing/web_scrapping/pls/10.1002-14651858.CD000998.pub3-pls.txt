Nutritional supplementation for stable chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
Low body weight is common in people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). It can weaken their heart and lung function, and reduce their ability to exercise. Some degree of malnutrition is common in people with COPD but it is unclear whether this is the cause of their deterioration, or just part of the progress of the disease. This review of 17 studies (632 participants) that provided nutritional supplementation for patients with COPD for more than two weeks found growing evidence that nutritional supplementation improved body weight, respiratory muscle strength, walking and quality of life.
