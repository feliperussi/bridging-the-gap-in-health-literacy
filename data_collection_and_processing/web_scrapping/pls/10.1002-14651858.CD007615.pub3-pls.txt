Interventions for prevention of neonatal hyperglycemia in very low birth weight infants
Blood sugar levels higher than usually seen in full term infants are frequently seen in babies born very early (before 32 weeks gestation) or with very low birth weight (< 1500 grams) and who are fed totally or partially by vein. Several types of adverse outcomes have been associated with high blood sugar levels including increased risks for death, infections, vision problems, and bleeding into the brain. It is not known if prevention of high blood sugar levels improves those complications and, if so, which intervention is best. Possible options include restriction of the amount of sugar delivered by vein to nourish the baby or administration of insulin. Trials which compared lower with higher amounts of sugar delivered by vein were too small to determine effects on the health outcomes of the babies. Insulin was found to reduce the number of babies who developed high blood sugar levels, but the health outcomes of the babies were not improved. In fact, insulin infusion was associated with an increased risk of death before 28 days of age.
