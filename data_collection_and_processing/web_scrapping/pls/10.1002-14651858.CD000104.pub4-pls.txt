Elective high frequency ventilation compared to conventional mechanical ventilation in the early stabilization of infants with respiratory distress 
Review question. Does the elective use of high frequency oscillatory ventilation as compared to conventional ventilation reduce lung damage and other complications associated with prematurity and assisted ventilation in preterm infants who are mechanically ventilated for respiratory distress syndrome (RDS)? 
Background. Respiratory failure due to lung immaturity is a major cause of deaths in preterm infants. Although the use of intermittent positive pressure ventilation in newborns with respiratory failure saves lives, its use is associated with lung injury and chronic lung disease. A newer form of ventilation called high frequency oscillatory ventilation has been shown in experimental studies to result in less lung injury. 
Study characteristics. Nineteen eligible studies involving 4096 infants met our inclusion criteria. 
Results. Insufficient evidence exists to support the routine use of high frequency oscillatory ventilation instead of conventional ventilation for preterm infants with lung disease who are given positive pressure ventilation. High frequency oscillatory ventilation is a way of providing artificial ventilation of the lungs that theoretically may produce less injury to the lungs and therefore reduce the rate of chronic lung disease. This review of the evidence from 19 randomised controlled trials showed that although a small protective effect towards the lungs can be seen, this moderate benefit is highly variable between studies and should be weighed against possible harm.
