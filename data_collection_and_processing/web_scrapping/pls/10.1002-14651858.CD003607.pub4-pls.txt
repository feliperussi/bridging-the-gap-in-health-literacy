Interventions for replacing missing teeth: horizontal and vertical bone augmentation techniques for dental implant treatment 
Some patients may have insufficient bone to place dental implants but there are many surgical techniques to increase the bone volume making implant treatment possible. Short implants appear to be more effective and cause less complications than conventional implants placed in resorbed lower jaws (mandibles) augmented with bone from the hip or bone substitutes (cow bone blocks). Bone can be regenerated in a horizontal and vertical direction using various techniques, but it is unclear which techniques are preferable, and complications especially for augmenting bone in a vertical direction are frequent. Some bone substitutes may cause less complications and pain than taking the own bone from various parts of the body.
