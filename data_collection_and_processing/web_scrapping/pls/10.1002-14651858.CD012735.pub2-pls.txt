Pitavastatin for lowering lipids
Review question 
How do different doses of pitavastatin affect fats in our blood?
Background 
Pitavastatin is the newest statin on the market. We don't know the effect of different sizes of dose on the amount of fats in our blood. 
Search date 
We looked at research up to March 2019.
Study characteristics 
We looked for high‐quality randomised trials (RCTs) and before‐and‐after studies with pitavastatin in different dose sizes . The trials were between three and 12 weeks long. 
Participants in the trials could be of any age and gender, with or without cardiovascular disease. 
Key results 
People taking 1 mg to 16 mg of pitavastatin per day lowered their LDL cholesterol by 33.3% to 54.7%. The higher the dose, the lower the levels of three measures of cholesterol. The average increase in HDL cholesterol for all doses was 4%. 
For lowering LDL cholesterol,  pitavastatin is 6‐times stronger than atorvastatin, 1.7‐times stronger than rosuvastatin, 77‐times stronger than fluvastatin and 3.3‐times weaker than cerivastatin. 
In the RCTS, no person out of 109 in the placebo group and three out of 262 people in the pitavastatin group dropped out due to adverse effects. 
Certainty of the evidence 
There is a high level of trust around the effects of pitavastatin on total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol and triglycerides.
