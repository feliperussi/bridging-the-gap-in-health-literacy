Antibiotics for lower urinary tract infection in children
Urinary tract infection (UTI) is one of the most common bacterial infections in infants and children. The most commonly presenting infection of the urinary tract is known as cystitis and in the majority of cases can be easily treated with a course of antibiotic therapy with no further complications. This review identified 16 studies investigating antibiotics for UTI in children. Results suggest that 10‐day antibiotic treatment is more likely to eliminate bacteria from the urine than single‐dose treatments; there was not enough data to draw conclusions about other treatment durations, or effectiveness of particular antibiotics. Although antibiotic treatment is effective for children with UTI, there are insufficient data to recommend any specific regimen.
