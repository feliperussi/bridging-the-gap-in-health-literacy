Minimally invasive surgery compared to open surgery for the treatment of solid tumours located in the chest or the abdomen of children 
Minimally invasive surgery (MIS) is an upcoming new surgical technique. MIS is done through one or more small incisions using a laparoscope or thoracoscope (a thin flexible tube containing a video camera) and surgical instruments. MIS can be used as a diagnostic instrument (i.e. to retrieve tissue samples for a biopsy) and is also used for the resection (i.e. to remove by surgery) of tumours (a lump or growth in a part of the body that is formed from abnormal cells). There is limited experience with the use of MIS for the resection of solid tumours in the chest or abdomen in children. 
This systematic review focused on randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and controlled clinical trials (CCTs). The authors could not identify any RCTs or CCTs RCTs on this subject. Thus there is insufficient evidence to allow any definitive conclusions regarding the therapeutic use of MIS in children with solid tumours in the chest or abdomen. More high quality RCTs are needed.
