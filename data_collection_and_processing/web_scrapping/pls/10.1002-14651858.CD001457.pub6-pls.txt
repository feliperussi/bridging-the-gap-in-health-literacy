Glutamine supplementation to prevent morbidity and mortality in preterm infants
Review question: In preterm infants, does glutamine supplementation reduce the risk of death or disability? 
Background: Glutamine is an important nutrient for growth and development and may be especially important in protecting preterm infants from infections and gut problems that cause death and disability. We sought evidence that giving preterm infants extra glutamine improves important outcomes. 
Study characteristics: We found 12 randomised controlled trials (enrolling 2877 infants in total). The trials were generally of good methodological quality. 
Key results: These trials did not provide strong or consistent evidence that glutamine supplementation affected the risk of death, serious infection or bowel disease, or longer term development. 
Conclusions: Glutamine supplementation is not likely to be beneficial for preterm infants.
