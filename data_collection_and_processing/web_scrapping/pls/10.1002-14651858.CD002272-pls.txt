Nasal intermittent positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) versus nasal continuous positive airway pressure (NCPAP) for apnea of prematurity 
Nasal intermittent positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) is a potentially beneficial treatment for apnea in premature babies, but more research is needed to confirm the effectiveness and safety of this intervention. Recurrent spells of apnea (pause in breathing greater than 20 seconds) are almost universal in babies born before 34 weeks gestation. Nasal continuous positive airway pressure (NCPAP) delivered via small prongs inserted in the baby's nose offers breathing support and is a useful treatment for apnea. However, not all babies respond to this treatment. Some infants fail and require a breathing tube inserted into their trachea (windpipe), which has potential complications (infection, injuries to the vocal cords). This review of two small trials suggests that nasal intermittent positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) delivered via nasal prongs may be more effective than NCPAP alone in preterm babies whose apneas are frequent or severe. Further research is needed to confirm effectiveness and safety as few babies have been studied so far.
