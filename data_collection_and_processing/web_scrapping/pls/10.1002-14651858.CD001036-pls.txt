This review is no longer appropriate for update as liquid based cytology has superceded smear technology. 
Cervical screening (pap smear) is an effective way of detecting pre‚Äêcancerous abnormalities of the cervix (cervical intraepithelial neoplasia). Tests can be affected by the tester's skill and the design of the device used. Inadequate smears can produce incorrect results, causing stress and inconvenience to women having to undergo repeat screening. This review of trials found that the commonly used Ayre spatula is not as effective in collecting cells as the extended tip spatula. The most effective appears to be a combination of the cytobrush with an extended tip spatula.
