Phenobarbital prior to preterm birth for preventing neonatal periventricular haemorrhage
Evidence does not support phenobarbital treatment to women giving birth before 34 weeks to decrease the risk of bleeding into the babies' brains. 
Babies born very early (before 34 weeks) are at risk of bleeding in the brain (periventricular haemorrhage). This can be a cause of brain damage that might lead to disability including cerebral palsy. Phenobarbital may prevent injury to the brain by stabilising blood pressure and blood flow in the brain. Possible adverse effects of phenobarbital for the women include drowsiness, gastrointestinal upset and development of a rash. 
Nine trials involving 1752 women were included in the review. The trials with low risk of bias found that phenobarbital given to women immediately prior to a very preterm birth did not decrease the risk of bleeding in the brains of the babies. No differences in child development were found on follow up at 18 to 24 months or at seven years. 
Maternal sedation was more likely in women receiving phenobarbital. The use of prenatal corticosteroids, known to reduce rates of periventricular haemorrhage, varied between trials and may have influenced findings.
