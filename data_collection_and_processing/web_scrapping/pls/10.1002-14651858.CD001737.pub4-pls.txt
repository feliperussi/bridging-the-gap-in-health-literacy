Skin grafts to improve leg ulcer healing
Approximately 1% of people in industrialised countries have a leg ulcer at some time, mainly caused by poor blood flow back from the legs towards the heart. Skin grafts, either using the patient's own skin, artificial skin or donor skin/cells, have been evaluated to see whether they improve the healing of ulcers. The review of trials found evidence that tissue‚Äêengineered skin composed of two layers increases the chance of healing. There was not enough evidence to recommend any other type of graft, and further research is required.
