Endobronchial brachytherapy as palliative care for people with inoperable non‐small cell lung cancer 
This is an updated version of the original review published in Issue 2, 2008 of The Cochrane Library. Patients with inoperable non‐small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) have a poor prognosis and the treatment options are limited to controlling their symptoms and maintaining their quality of life. Palliative endobronchial brachytherapy (EBB) is sometimes used to improve local control of the tumor, and the patient's symptoms and quality of life. Endobronchial brachytherapy is a procedure that involves placing radioactive material inside the patient's airways as an 'internal radiotherapy'. 
We were not able to provide conclusive evidence from randomized controlled trials to support the use of EBB in combination with external beam radiation therapy (EBRT), chemotherapy or neodymium:yttrium‐aluminum‐garnet (Nd‐YAG) laser. 
From heterogeneous information obtained from several small RCTs, we conclude that EBRT alone is more effective for palliation than EBB alone. If patients who previously were treated with EBRT develop symptoms from the tumour growing again in the main airways, EBB may in some cases be an appropriate treatment to consider.
