Tricyclic antidepressants for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in children and adolescents 
Background 
ADHD affects a large number of children and adolescents, giving rise to problems with inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity. A variety of medications, including tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), may be used to treat the core symptoms of ADHD. 
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the effectiveness of TCAs in improving the core symptoms of ADHD in children and adolescents with ADHD, and whether or not they might cause harm. 
Trial characteristics 
The evidence is current to 26 September 2013. Only six trials including 216 participants met our inclusion criteria. All trials were conducted in the USA and lasted between two and six weeks. Two trials were funded, in part, by the drug manufacturers. 
Key results 
Findings showed that TCAs, particularly desipramine, had a beneficial effect for children and adolescents with ADHD in terms of improving their core symptoms in the short‚Äêterm. However, TCAs also had unwanted cardiac effects, which may limit their use. 
Quality of the evidence 
The total number of included trials was small and each used many different outcome measures, making it difficult to combine their results. Further research is needed to test whether the findings from these trials are universally applicable; these should be conducted in different locations, with ethnically diverse participants, and use validated outcome measures to assess the core symptoms of ADHD.
