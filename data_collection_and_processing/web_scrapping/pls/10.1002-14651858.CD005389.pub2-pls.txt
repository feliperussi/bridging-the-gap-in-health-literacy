Fluid restriction as a treatment for preterm infants developing chronic lung disease
Background  Babies born prematurely are at risk of developing a form of chronic lung disease which is defined as persistent need for oxygen once the child has reached a corrected gestational age of 36 weeks. As fluid accumulation in the lung is one of the processes involved in the early phases of lung disease in premature babies, low fluid intake might halt the progression of the insult and result in lower rates of chronic lung disease of prematurity. 
Study characteristics  Our search identified only one study comparing two volumes of fluid intake in preterm infants with early signs of chronic lung disease. Unfortunately, this study did not report progression to established chronic lung disease. Hence, no infant could be included in this analysis. 
Other outcomes, including days that the baby needed extra oxygen, proportion of infants discharged from hospital on oxygen, days of assisted ventilation, duration of hospital stay, weight gain and serious apnoeas were not affected by the volume of fluid received (from the evidence graded as low quality). The evidence is current to February 2016. 
Key results  There is no study comparing low to high fluid intake in a population of preterm babies with early signs of chronic respiratory disease to prevent progression to full blown chronic lung disease or death. Other outcomes were not improved by fluid restriction. 
Quality of evidence  Not applicable.
