Corticosteroids for preventing relapse following acute exacerbations of asthma
In an asthma attack, the airways (passages to the lungs) narrow from muscle spasms and swelling (inflammation). Bronchodilators (reliever inhalers to open up the lungs and airways) can be used for the spasms, and corticosteroids for the swelling. However, many people who are discharged from the emergency department following treatment for an asthma attacks have a relapse within 10 days. The review of six trials involving 374 people found that a short course of corticosteroids after discharge reduces the chances of a relapse, and lessens the need for using reliever inhalers without major adverse effects. The benefit lasts for about three weeks.
