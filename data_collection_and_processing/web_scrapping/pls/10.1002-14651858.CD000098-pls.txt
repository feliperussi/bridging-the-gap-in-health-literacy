Antibiotics for gonorrhoea in pregnancy
Pregnant women with gonorrhoea who take penicillin, spectinomycin or ceftriaxone are much less likely to show signs of infection. 
Neisseria gonorrhoeae is a bacteria transmitted (passed) during sex, causing an infection in the genital area. Pregnant women with gonorrhoea may pass the infection to babies during birth. This can affect the baby's eyesight, causing blindness. The review of two trials, involving 346 women, found evidence that pregnant women who take penicillin, spectinomycin, ceftriaxone or cefixime are much less likely to have signs of gonorrhoea a week to 10 days later. Further research is needed to find out which antibiotic treatment is the best for preventing infection of the baby.
