Antibiotics are effective in preventing post‐operative complications following infection of the peritoneum (peritonitis), but there is no evidence to support that one regimen is superior to another, and at the same time has less side effects. 
Patients with peritonitis originated from the gut will often require surgery. Antibiotics are useful in the treatment of the ongoing infection and for prevention of post‐operative complications.  This review does not result in specific recommendations for any antibiotic regimen for the first line treatment of secondary peritonitis in adults, as all regimens showed equivocal efficacy. Other factors such as local guidelines and preferences, ease of administration, costs and availability must therefore be taken into consideration in deciding the antibiotic regimen of choice. More large scale trials are needed, and future trials should attempt to stratify patients and perform intention‐to‐treat analysis to allow better external validity.
