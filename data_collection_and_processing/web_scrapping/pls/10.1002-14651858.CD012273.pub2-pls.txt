Branched‐chain amino acid supplementation for improving nutrition in term and preterm neonates 
Review question 
Does supplementation of branched‐chain amino acids (BCAAs) improve physical and neurological development and other health outcomes in term and preterm neonates? 
Background 
Although leucine, isoleucine and valine—a group of essential amino acids—play an important role in neonatal nutrition, the optimal dosages are still unknown. Neonates usually consume BCAAs from breast milk and artificial formula, and those treated in hospitals due to various problems, including premature birth, asphyxia (lack of oxygen) and infections, may take them in from infusion solutions. Suboptimal intake of BCAAs can be caused by poor sucking and by inappropriate infusion therapy as well, which might lead to poor growth and neurological impairment. Thus, we attempted to reveal whether BCAA supplementation can improve health outcomes in term and preterm neonates. 
Study characteristics 
We did not find any eligible randomised controlled trials that assessed the effect of BCAA supplementation for term and preterm neonates. The evidence is up to date as of August 2019. 
Key results and conclusions 
This review is unable to suggest the effect of BCAA supplementation on physical growth and neurological development in term and preterm neonates. Future studies are required as this assessment is very important in the neonatal field.
