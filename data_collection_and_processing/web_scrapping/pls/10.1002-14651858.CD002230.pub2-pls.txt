Phosphodiesterase III inhibitor class drugs taken orally and long term are associated with increased deaths in heart failure 
A number of options are available to treat symptomatic chronic heart failure. These include ACE inhibitors, beta‚Äêblockers and spironolactone, which result in an increase of life expectancy. Another strategy is to increase the strength of the pumping action of the heart as with digitalis and with phosphodiesterase III inhibitors. The review clearly showed evidence that people treated for chronic heart failure for three months or more with phosphodiesterase III inhibitors were more likely to die than people given an inactive placebo treatment.
