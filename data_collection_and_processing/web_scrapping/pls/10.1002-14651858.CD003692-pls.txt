Fibrinolytic therapy for intraventricular hemorrhage in adults
There is no evidence available on the effect of clot dissolving drugs for intraventricular hemorrhage. About one‐sixth of all acute strokes are due to bleeding in the brain. Sometimes the blood enters the ventricles, the fluid‐filled spaces within the brain. This can block the circulation of fluid around the brain, causing rapid neurologic deterioration and even death. Fibrinolytic (or clot dissolving) treatment might help to break up blood clots, promote clearance of blood and reduce the risk of poor outcome. This review was not able to find sufficient good quality evidence from randomized trials to show whether this treatment does more good than harm. This therapy appears promising but further trials are needed to fully assess safety and efficacy.
