Kangaroo mother care to reduce morbidity and mortality in low birthweight infants
Review question: Does kangaroo mother care (KMC) reduce morbidity and mortality in low birthweight (LBW) infants? 
Background: Conventional neonatal care of LBW infants (< 2500 g) is expensive and requires both highly skilled personnel and permanent logistical support. KMC has been proposed as an alternative to conventional neonatal care of LBW infants. The major component of KMC is skin‐to‐skin contact between mother and newborn. The other two components of KMC are frequent and exclusive or nearly exclusive breastfeeding and attempted early discharge from hospital. 
Study characteristics: We identified 21 randomized controlled trials (3042 infants) for inclusion in this review by searching medical databases in June 2016. 
Key results: Compared with conventional neonatal care, KMC was found to reduce mortality at discharge or at 40 to 41 weeks' postmenstrual age and at latest follow‐up, severe infection/sepsis, nosocomial infection/sepsis, hypothermia, severe illness, and lower respiratory tract disease. Moreover, KMC increased weight, length, and head circumference gain, breastfeeding at discharge or at 40 to 41 weeks' postmenstrual age and at one to three months' follow‐up, mother satisfaction with method of infant care, some measures of maternal‐infant attachment, and home environment. Researchers noted no differences in neurodevelopmental and neurosensory outcomes at 12 months' corrected age. 
Quality of evidence: Most critical and important outcomes had moderate‐quality evidence. 
Conclusions: KMC is an effective and safe alternative to conventional neonatal care for LBW infants, mainly in resource‐limited countries.
