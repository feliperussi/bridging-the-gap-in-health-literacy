Anticoagulants for intermittent claudication
Atherosclerosis is a disease of the arteries in which fatty deposits block the flow of blood. This can cause intermittent claudication, when cramping pain in the legs is brought on by exercise and relieved by rest. These fatty deposits can also cause serious blockages that lead to heart attacks and the need for amputation (surgical removal of the limb). Anticoagulants, such as heparin or warfarin, are drugs that prevent clotting and may help people with intermittent claudication. No new studies were included for this update. Seven studies with 802 participants were included in this review. The review of trials found that the benefit of heparin, LMWHs and oral anticoagulants for treatment of intermittent claudication has not been established while an increased risk of major bleeding events has been observed, especially with oral anticoagulants. There is no clear evidence to support the use of anticoagulants for intermittent claudication at this stage. More research is needed.
