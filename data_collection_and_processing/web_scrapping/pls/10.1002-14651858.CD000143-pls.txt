Nasal continuous positive airways pressure immediately after extubation for preventing morbidity in preterm infants 
Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) provides extra gas flow through the nose and thereby helps keep the lung properly inflated. This helps reduce breathing problems in preterm babies after the tube used to assist breathing is removed from their windpipe. Preterm babies (babies born before 37 weeks) may need help to breathe properly. Sometimes this is given via a tube placed into the windpipe, through the mouth or nose, to give oxygen from a machine (mechanical ventilation). This method helps restore breathing but when the tube is removed (this process of removal is called extubation), breathing problems can occur. Nasal continuous positive airways pressure (NCPAP) provides extra gas flow through the nose and thereby helps keep the lung properly inflated. The review of trials found NCPAP is effective in preventing failure of extubation after a period of mechanical ventilation.
