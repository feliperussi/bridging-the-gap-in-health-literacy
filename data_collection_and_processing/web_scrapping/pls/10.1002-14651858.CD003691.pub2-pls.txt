Ginkgo biloba for acute ischaemic stroke
Ginkgo biloba extract, a Chinese traditional medicine, is widely used in the treatment of acute ischaemic stroke in China and is also used occasionally in Europe but its efficacy is uncertain. There is limited experimental support for the use of Ginkgo biloba extract in ischaemic stroke. Hence, it has been shown that Ginkgo biloba extract leads to a significant increase in cerebral blood flow and glucose uptake into brain tissue. This review identified all randomised or quasi‐randomised trials of Ginkgo biloba extract in patients with acute ischaemic stroke. There was no convincing evidence, from trials of sufficient methodological quality, to support the routine use of Ginkgo biloba extract to promote recovery after stroke. High‐quality and large‐scale randomised controlled trials are needed to test its efficacy.
