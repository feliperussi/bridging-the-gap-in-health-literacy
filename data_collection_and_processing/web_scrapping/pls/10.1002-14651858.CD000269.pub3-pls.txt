Some evidence that CDP‐choline has a positive effect on memory and behaviour in at least the short/medium term in elderly people with cognitive deficits associated with chronic cerebral disorders of the brain 
Patients with cognitive deficits associated with chronic cerebrovascular disorders may not respond to anti‐dementia treatments in the same manner as can be observed in cases of Alzheimer's dementia. There is some evidence that CDP‐choline provides modest but consistent improvement of memory and behaviour in these patients. These findings, however, are limited by the relatively short‐term of clinical controlled observations which in all studies but one lasted for no more than three months. Subjective evaluations of these patients as given by their doctors were consistently positive and no noticeable side effects were evidenced in the various studies over the years.
