Does tobacco advertising and promotion make it more likely that adolescents will start to smoke 
Advertising is the use of media to create positive product imagery or associations. Promotion or marketing is the mix of activities designed to increase sales. There are no trials of the impact of tobacco advertising and promotional activities on people taking up smoking. However, there are studies following nonsmokers and their exposure to advertising (such as the number of tobacco advertisements in the magazines they read). The review found that in all these studies, nonsmoking adolescents who were more aware of or receptive to tobacco advertising were more likely to become smokers later.
