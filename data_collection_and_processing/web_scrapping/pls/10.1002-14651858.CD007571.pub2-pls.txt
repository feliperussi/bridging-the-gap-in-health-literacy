Vedolizumab for the treatment of active and inactive ulcerative colitis
Ulcerative colitis is a chronic inflammatory disease of the colon. Vedolizumab (formerly known as MLN‐02) is a synthetic antibody that blocks the adhesion and migration of white blood cells into the gut, reducing intestinal inflammation. This medication is given to patients intravenously. Four studies including 606 patients were included in this review. Pooled analysis of these trials revealed vedolizumab is significantly more effective than placebo (sham infusion) for inducing clinical remission and response (improvement of symptoms), as well as endoscopic remission (healing of inflamed mucosa in the colon) in patients with moderate to severely active ulcerative colitis. Evidence from one study suggests that vedolizumab is superior to placebo for preventing relapse (recurrence of active disease) in patients with ulcerative colitis in remission. Patients receiving vedolizumab were no more likely than placebo patients to experience side effects or serious side effects. Commonly reported side effects included: worsening ulcerative colitis, headache, nasopharyngitis (inflammation of nose and throat), upper respiratory tract infection, nausea, and abdominal pain. Further research is needed in order to define the optimal dose, frequency of drug administration and the long‐term effectiveness and safety of vedolizumab used for induction and maintenance of remission in ulcerative colitis. Vedolizumab should be compared to other currently approved therapies of ulcerative colitis in these studies.
