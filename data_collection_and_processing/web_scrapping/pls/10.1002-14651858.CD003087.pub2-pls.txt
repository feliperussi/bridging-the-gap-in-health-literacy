Double gloving to reduce surgical cross‐infection
Surgical operations are undertaken within a clean environment and with members of the surgical team wearing sterile gloves. Sterile surgical gloves aim to protect the patient from contamination with bacteria from members of the surgical team and protect the surgical team from the body fluids of the patient. Double‐gloving (wearing two sets of gloves) is becoming more common, especially for surgery where sharp surfaces are formed (such as orthopaedic or dental surgery). The review found that a second pair of gloves does protect the inner pair, without apparently affecting surgical performance. A glove liner between the two pairs of gloves reduces breaks to the inner glove even further, and extra‐thick gloves seem to be as good as two pairs.
