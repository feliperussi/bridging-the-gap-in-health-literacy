Cyclophosphamide for treating rheumatoid arthritis
This review included 31 patients taking cyclophosphamide and 39 patients taking placebo. Patients taking cyclophosphamide had improved tender and swollen joint scores. Patients receiving placebo were six times more likely to discontinue treatment because of lack of treatment effect than patients receiving cyclophosphamide. Withdrawals from adverse reactions were higher in the cyclophosphamide group. Side effects from cyclophosphamide included hemorrhagic cystitis, nausea, vomiting, leucopenia, thrombocytopenia, alopecia, amenorrhea and herpes zoster infections. 
Cyclophosphamide appears to have a clinically and statistically significant benefit on the disease activity of patients with rheumatoid arthritis. But due to serious side effects, its use should remain limited to patients who have failed treatment with various other therapies.
