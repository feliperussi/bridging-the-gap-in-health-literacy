Interventions for recurrent nosebleeds of unknown cause in children
Nosebleeds in children usually just stop by themselves or after pinching the nose. However, some children get repeated nosebleeds with no specific cause (recurrent idiopathic epistaxis). The most common treatments are cautery or antiseptic cream, or both. Cautery (a method of sealing) can be painful even with local anaesthetic, and usually involves using a silver nitrate stick to seal off a visible blood vessel inside the nose that may be rupturing. Other options include ointments and nasal sprays. The review of trials found that there is not enough evidence to compare the effectiveness of different treatment options, however using a lower concentration of silver nitrate cautery is more effective in the short term and less painful. More research is needed to show the best options for reducing recurrent nosebleeds of unknown cause in children.
