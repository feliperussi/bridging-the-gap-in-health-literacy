Prescription drug use for managing agitation and aggression in people with acquired brain injury 
This review found no firm evidence that drug management of agitation and aggression in adults with acquired brain injury is effective. There was weak evidence, based on a few small randomized controlled trials, that beta‚Äêblockers can improve aggression after acquired brain injury, but very large doses were used which would have been likely to produce significant adverse effects. For other classes of medication, reasonable size randomized controlled trials have not been published. 
Based on the lack of evidence, the review comes to no conclusion on the effectiveness of drugs. There is reasonable anecdotal evidence, for example in published cases series, that antipsychotics, mood stabilizers and antidepressants may be effective in the management of this situation.
