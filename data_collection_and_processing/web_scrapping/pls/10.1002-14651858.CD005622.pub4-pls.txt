Lidocaine for pain relief in people with burns
Background
Burns are very common and sometimes fatal, and the pain associated with such injury is one of the most difficult types to relieve. The use of high‐dose opioid medications like morphine is common, but side effects are encountered. Alternative agents such as lidocaine, an anaesthetic, have been proposed. This is an update of the review of the same name first published in 2007. 
Study characteristics 
We searched scientific databases for studies assessing the pain‐relieving effects of intravenous (given into the blood stream through a vein) lidocaine in adults with a burn injury. We included studies comparing lidocaine with no treatment, placebo (a pretend treatment), other analgesics (pain killers), or a combination of these. We wanted to look at (for example) severity of pain, time to requiring more medication, rescue analgesia (where extra pain relief is needed in addition to that planned) and side effects. The evidence is current to December 2013. 
Key results 
We found one small clinical trial, involving only 45 participants, which showed a benefit from intravenous lidocaine for pain relief in people with burns. The trial did not show a difference in opioid use, participant anxiety or level of participant satisfaction with the use of intravenous lidocaine. 
Quality of the evidence 
The small included study provided insufficient data to draw any conclusions.
