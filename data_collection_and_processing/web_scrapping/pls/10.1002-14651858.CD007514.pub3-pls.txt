Statins for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease
Background 
High levels of cholesterol (a fatty substance known as a lipid) in the blood are thought to contribute to the cause of Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia. The statin family of medications (lovastatin, pravastatin, simvastatin and others) are powerful cholesterol‐lowering medications and are first‐line treatments for reducing cholesterol in people with, or at risk of, cardiovascular disease. There has been much interest in the possible role of statins in the treatment of dementia. 
Study characteristics 
Two independent authors searched scientific databases for studies in which a statin or a placebo (a pretend treatment) was given for at least six months. We included people with a probable or possible diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease according to standard clinical criteria. The findings were current to January 2014. 
Key results 
We identified four studies involving 1154 participants (age range 50 to 90 years). The studies used standard tests to assess the severity of Alzheimer's disease. From these trials, including two large trials, we found no evidence that statins help in the treatment of cognitive decline in dementia. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of evidence is felt to be high as two large randomised controlled trials have been included along with two smaller ones.
