Group parenting programmes for improving behavioural problems in children aged 3 to 12 years 
Parenting programmes that are delivered in group settings have the potential to help parents develop parenting skills that improve the behaviour of their young children. This review provides evidence that group‐based parenting programmes improve childhood behaviour problems and the development of positive parenting skills in the short‐term, whilst also reducing parental anxiety, stress and depression. Evidence for the longer‐term effects of these programmes is unavailable. These group‐based parenting programmes achieve good results at a cost of approximately $2500 (£1712 or €2217) per family. These costs are modest when compared with the long‐term social, educational and legal costs associated with childhood conduct problems.
