Zonisamide for neuropathic pain in adults
Neuropathic pain can arise from damage to nerves and injury to the central nervous system. It is different from pain messages carried along healthy nerves from damaged tissue (a fall, or cut, or arthritic knee). Neuropathic pain is treated by different medicines than those used for pain from damaged tissue. Medicines like paracetamol or ibuprofen are not usually effective in neuropathic pain, while medicines that are sometimes used to treat depression or epilepsy can be very effective in some people with neuropathic pain. 
Zonisamide is one of a type of medicine normally used to treat epilepsy. Some of these medicines are also useful for treating neuropathic pain. We looked for clinical trials that used zonisamide to treat neuropathic pain. We found a single study with 25 participants treated either with zonisamide or placebo. Study reporting may have led to major over‚Äêestimation of any treatment effects because most (8/13) participants treated with zonisamide withdrew before the end of 12 weeks of treatment for a variety of reasons, mostly adverse events (side effects). 
There was too little information, which was of inadequate quality, to give any guidance as to whether zonisamide works as a pain medicine in any neuropathic pain condition. Other medicines have been shown to be effective in some types of neuropathic pain.
