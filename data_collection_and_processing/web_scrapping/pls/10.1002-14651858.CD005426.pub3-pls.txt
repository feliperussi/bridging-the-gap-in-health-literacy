Nutritional support for acute kidney injury
Maintaining nutritional balance is vital in treating patients with acute kidney injury (AKI). Nutritional therapies, including parenteral nutrition (delivered via injection) and enteric (oral) nutrition are widely used. Eight randomised controlled trials (257 participants) were included in this review. Essential L‚Äêamino acids may shorten the overall duration of kidney dysfunction and improved survival from AKI. However, due to the small number of participants and the poor quality of some studies, we are unable to provide recommendations for the use of nutritional support for treating AKI.
