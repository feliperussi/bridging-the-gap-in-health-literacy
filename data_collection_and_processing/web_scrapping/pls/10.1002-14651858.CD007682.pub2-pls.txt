Techniques for preparation prior to embryo transfer
Embryo transfer (ET) is the final and most vulnerable step in in vitro fertilisation (IVF) treatment. In vitro fertilisation outcomes could be improved by preparation techniques such as straightening the utero‚Äêcervical angle, cervical and endometrial preparation, the performance of a dummy transfer and embryo afterloading. This review found no evidence from randomised controlled trials that any of these techniques benefit the outcomes in IVF.
