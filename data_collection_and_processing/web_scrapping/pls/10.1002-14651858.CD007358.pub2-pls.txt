Single dose oral flurbiprofen for acute postoperative pain in adults
A single dose of flurbiprofen 50 mg or 100 mg provides a high level of pain relief to 65% to 70% of those with moderate or severe postoperative pain. It has similar efficacy to other commonly used analgesics at standard doses, including ibuprofen and naproxen, with a duration of action exceeding 6 hours. Adverse events were no more common with flurbiprofen than with placebo in these single dose studies.
