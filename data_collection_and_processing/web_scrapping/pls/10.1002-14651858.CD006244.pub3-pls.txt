Care delivery and self management strategies for adults with epilepsy
Evidence for the effectiveness of care interventions for adults with epilepsy is still unclear. 
This review compared the effectiveness of a range of interventions, including specialist nurses and management strategies, in improving outcomes for adults with epilepsy. We identified seven distinct intervention types, with varying amounts of evidence to support them. While included studies did show some benefit from specialist epilepsy nurses and self management education, other intervention types lack evidence of effectiveness. This is compounded by the poor quality methods of some studies and by the complex nature of the interventions, whose impact may vary according to where they take place. Based on this evidence, it is not possible to advocate any specific intervention type in the care of adults with epilepsy.
