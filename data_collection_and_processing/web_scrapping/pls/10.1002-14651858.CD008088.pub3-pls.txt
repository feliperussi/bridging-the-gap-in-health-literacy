Anti‐TNF‐α drugs for women with endometriosis‐related pelvic pain
Endometriosis is a painful condition in which endometrial tissue grows outside the uterus. It potentially affects a woman's ability to conceive. Recent studies support the contributing role of inflammation in endometriosis‐related pain. Since anti‐TNF‐α drugs can inhibit the inflammation process, they may relieve the symptoms of the disease without inhibiting ovulation. However, this systematic review included one randomised controlled trial and found that there was not enough evidence from which to draw conclusions about the effectiveness and safety of anti‐TNF‐α drugs in relieving pain in women with endometriosis. There was no evidence of an increase in adverse events in the anti‐TNF‐α drugs group compared with the placebo group.
