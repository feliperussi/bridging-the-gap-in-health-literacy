Psychologically mediated effects of the physical healthcare environment on work‐related outcomes of healthcare personnel 
Research has demonstrated that the physical healthcare environment can affect patients' health and well‐being. However, the healthcare environment affects not only patients, but also the people that work in these environments: nurses and physicians. Any changes that are made to the physical healthcare environment in order to benefit patients (e.g. renovation of hospital wards) must either benefit or have neutral impacts on healthcare professionals. 
A review of the effects of changes to the physical healthcare environment on healthcare professionals was undertaken. Only one study was found which compared renovated wards of a psychiatric hospital to non‐renovated wards. 
There is no evidence to support or refute the impact of the physical healthcare environment on work‐related outcomes of healthcare staff. This review does show that more work needs to be done in order to understand the effects of changes to physical healthcare environments on healthcare professionals.
