Transcutaneous carbon dioxide monitoring for the prevention of neonatal morbidity and mortality 
Review question. We reviewed the evidence about the effects of different modalities to monitor carbon dioxide (CO2) in the newborn. Does the use of transcutaneous CO2 monitoring improve survival and other important outcomes in newly born infants? 
Background. CO2 measurement is a very important procedure because abnormal values of CO2 may have detrimental effects in the sick newborn. There are three main methods to assess CO2: in the arterial blood gas, in the air exhaled from the body, and through the skin, that is, transcutaneously. The latter is minimally invasive and allows continuous monitoring. The evidence is current to November 2015. 
Study characteristics and results. No studies were included in this review, and no ongoing studies were identified.
