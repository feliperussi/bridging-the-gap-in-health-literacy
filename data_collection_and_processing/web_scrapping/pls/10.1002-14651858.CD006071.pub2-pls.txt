Continuous infusion versus intermittent bolus doses of indomethacin for patent ductus arteriosus closure in symptomatic preterm infants 
Patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) occurs when an artery near the heart and lungs stays open and does not close off after birth. Babies born early (preterm) have an increased risk of complications and death due to PDA. Indomethacin has been used to close the PDA; however, it can reduce blood flow in organs such as brain, kidneys and intestine. There is no agreement on the ideal dose and duration of treatment with indomethacin. In order to reduce the adverse effects of indomethacin on blood flow, some investigators have recommended administering the same total dose as a continuous infusion over 36 hours. In this review, the analysis of the two eligible trials found that the data was insufficient to reach a conclusion regarding the effectiveness of the 36‐hr continuous infusion method. The blood flow lowering side‐effects of indomethacin were reduced by the continuous infusion method, but there was insufficient data to recommend this administration method versus the traditional method.
