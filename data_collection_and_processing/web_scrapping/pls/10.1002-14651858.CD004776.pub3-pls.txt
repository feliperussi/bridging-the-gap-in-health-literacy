Treatment for anemia in people with AIDS
There is a lack of reliable evidence on interventions for treating anemia in persons with HIV infection or AIDS. Persons with HIV infection or AIDS are more likely than the general population to develop anemia, and anemia is the most common blood disorder in the HIV/AIDS infected population. Compared to those who do not develop anemia, HIV‐infected individuals who develop anemia are more likely to die early. It is important, therefore, to have good evidence regarding interventions that might be used to treat anemia. This update Cochrane review six randomized trials (537 participants), all of which investigated recombinant human erythropoietin. It did not reduce mortality and transfusion requirements. Furthermore, recombinant human erythropoietin did not increase hemoglobin levels and improve quality of life in HIV‐infected patients with anemia. All trials were judged to be of poor methodological quality. 
Potential randomised trial should include outcomes such as mortality and quality of life, and pregnant women, children and all ethnic people. Furthermore, trial should be sponsored by World Health Organization with an international board committee.
