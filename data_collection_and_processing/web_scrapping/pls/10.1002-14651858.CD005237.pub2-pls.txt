Risperidone versus olanzapine for schizophrenia
Schizophrenia is a debilitating mental illness that affects about one percent of the population worldwide.  People who suffer from schizophrenia can sometimes experience a relapse of their illness and may require admission to hospital. Incidences of relapse can be exacerbated due to poor compliance with medication; often a consequence of the adverse effects associated with antipsychotic drugs. 
Risperidone and olanzapine are among a class of antipsychotic drugs commonly referred to as atypical antipsychotics or new generation drugs. We systematically reviewed the effects of risperidone in comparison to olanzapine for people with schizophrenia and schizophrenia‚Äêlike illnesses. We were able to include 16 studies. Both drugs appear to have favourable effects in terms of improvement of symptoms. Both these drugs are also associated with adverse effects. Risperidone is commonly associated with movement disorders and sexual dysfunction and olanzapine with considerable weight gain.
