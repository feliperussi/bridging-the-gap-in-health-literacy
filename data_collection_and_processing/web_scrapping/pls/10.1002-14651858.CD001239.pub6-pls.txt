Intravenous immunoglobulin for suspected or proven infection in neonates
Background 
Infants may acquire infection while in the womb or in the hospital after birth, especially if they require intensive care. Such infections may cause serious illness or death. Maternal transport of immunoglobulins (substances in the blood that can fight infection) to the fetus mainly occurs after 32 weeks' gestation, and infants do not begin to produce their own immunoglobulins until several months after birth. Theoretically, the adverse effects of infection could be reduced by the administration of intravenous immunoglobulin. 
Our review question 
In newborn infants with suspected or proven infections, does the injection of immunoglobulin into the veins reduce death or illness? 
What the studies showed 
In addition to many small studies, a very large trial that enrolled 3493 infants has been published. It is clear from the available studies that intravenous immunoglobulin administration does not prevent death or illness during hospital stay, and death or major disability at two years of age. 
Overall 
The use of intravenous immunoglobulin to treat suspected or proven infection in neonates is not recommended. No further research is recommended.
