Glucocorticosteroid pretreatment may increase virologic response to interferon in hepatitis B 'e' antigen positive chronic hepatitis B 
Interferon is an established treatment for chronic infection with hepatitis B virus. Although it is effective, response rates are not satisfactory. In order to increase response rates glucocorticosteroid withdrawal therapy has been proposed as a pretreatment strategy. The objectives of this review were to assess the effects of the sequential combination of glucocorticosteroids and interferon compared to interferon alone in the treatment of chronic hepatitis B. Glucocorticosteroid pretreatment was associated with a significantly higher frequency of loss of hepatitis B markers (HBeAg and HBV DNA), but had no significant effect on clinical outcomes.
