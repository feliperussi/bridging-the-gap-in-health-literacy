The role of high‐frequency oscillations in epilepsy surgery planning
Background  Epilepsy is characterized by recurrent seizures. Seizures are typically short events with changes in awareness, changes in feelings or sensations, and strange body movements. More than half of the people with epilepsy have seizures which can be controlled with medication. For those with epileptic seizures that do not respond to medication, surgery can treat the seizures in many, but not all, individuals. New tools are being investigated to more accurately find the area in the brain which produces the seizures, to help remove the area of the brain causing the seizures. Recordings of high‐frequency oscillations (HFOs) (these are signals in the brain that oscillate faster than the typical signals that are recorded) may be one such tool. 
Results  Our literature searches carried out on 25 July 2016 found that so far 11 participants have been enrolled in two small prospective studies that used recordings of abnormal HFOs to help delineate the epileptogenic zone and guide resective surgery. 
Conclusions  No reliable conclusions can be drawn from the limited evidence that exists at present.
