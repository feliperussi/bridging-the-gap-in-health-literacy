Cyclosporine for treating rheumatoid arthritis
This review included three trials with a total of 318 patients. A statistically significant decrease in the number of tender and swollen joints was found for patients taking cyclosporine when compared to those taking placebo. Significant improvements in pain and function were also found for those patients taking cyclosporine. More side effects occurred in the cyclosporine group compared to the placebo group. 
Cyclosporine has an important clinical benefit in the short‚Äêterm (up to one year) treatment of patients with progressive rheumatoid arthritis.
