Foam dressings for venous leg ulcers
Venous leg ulcers are a common and recurring type of chronic wound. Compression therapy (bandages or stockings) is used to treat venous leg ulcers. Dressings that aim to protect the wound and provide a moist environment to aid ulcer healing are applied beneath compression devices. Foam dressings are one of several types of dressing available. We evaluated the evidence from 12 randomised controlled trials that either compared different types of foam dressings, or compared foam dressings with other types of wound dressings. We found no evidence to suggest that polyurethane foam dressings are significantly better or worse than hydrocellular foam dressings in venous leg ulcer healing. Similarly, we found no evidence to suggest that foam dressings are significantly better or worse than other types of dressings (paraffin‐impregnated gauze dressings, hydrocapillary dressings, hydrocolloid dressings, knitted viscose dressings, or protease‐modulating matrix dressings), for the healing of venous leg ulcers. We found insufficient evidence to draw any conclusions regarding: adverse events, quality of life, costs, pain, or dressing performance. Overall, the current evidence is of low or unclear methodological quality. This limits the making of any specific recommendations regarding the use of foam dressings. Further, good quality evidence is required before definitive conclusions can be made regarding the role of foam dressings in the management of venous leg ulcers.
