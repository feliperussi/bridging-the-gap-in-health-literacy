A gentler form of mechanical breathing for people affected by severe lung failure
Critically ill people affected by severe, acute respiratory failure need air to be pumped into their lungs (mechanical ventilation) to survive. Mechanical support buys time for the lungs to heal. Nevertheless, 35% to 65% still die. Several studies have suggested that mechanical breathing can also cause lung damage and bleeding. A new lung protective way of mechanical ventilation was tested in large studies. In this third update of the Cochrane review we searched the databases until September 2012 but we did not find any new study which was eligible for inclusion. The total number of studies remained unchanged, six trials involving 1297 people. This systematic review shows that a gentler form of mechanical breathing (so‚Äêcalled protective ventilation) can decrease deaths in the short term, by 26% on average, but the effects in the long term are uncertain or unknown.
