Earlier compared to later addition of human milk fortifier to human milk to promote growth in preterm infants 
Review question 
Does adding human milk fortifier (HMF) early promote growth and improve outcomes in preterm infants compared to adding it late? 
Background 
Uncertainty exists about the optimal point at which HMF should be added to human milk for promoting growth in preterm infants. The most common practice is to start HMF when the infant’s daily feed volume reaches 100 mL/kg body weight. Another approach is to commence HMF earlier, in some cases as early as the first feed. Adding HMF early could increase nutrient intake and growth rates but may increase the risk of feed intolerance and necrotising enterocolitis. 
Study characteristics 
Evidence is up‐to‐date as of August 2019. We identified two randomised controlled trials that evaluated the effects of adding HMF early for preterm infants. 
Key results 
We found only limited data from two trials. There is uncertainty as to whether adding HMF early for preterm infants has an effect on important outcomes such as growth during hospital stay, necrotising enterocolitis, death before discharge, presence of growth failure at discharge, and length of hospital stay. 
Certainty of evidence 
The available evidence is insufficient to support or refute early addition of HMF to human milk to promote growth in preterm infants. More trials are needed to examine whether adding HMF early is beneficial or harmful for preterm infants.
