Antibiotics for preventing infection in open limb fractures
Wound and bone infections are common complications following open fractures of the limbs. For more than 20 years in developed countries, the use of antibiotics has been a part of a standard management protocol that also includes washing the wound (irrigation), cleaning up the wound and fracture (surgical debridement), and stabilisation of the fracture, as required. This review, which included data from 1106 participants in eight trials, found that antibiotics are effective in decreasing the incidence of wound infections, as compared with no antibiotics or placebo. No studies reporting bone infection or long‚Äêterm ill health (morbidity) were identified.
