Penicillamine for treating rheumatoid arthritis
Penicillamine is a penicillin derived compound. Studies showed that this could be used to treat rheumatoid arthritis originally in 1950. It was frequently used in the past, but its use has declined with the increasing use of other disease modifying anti‐rheumatic drugs (DMARDs), such as methotrexate. The purpose of this summary was to find out if penicillamine is helpful in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. 
Penicillamine was seen to be beneficial for all ranges of dosages for disease activity on tender joint pain, physician global assessment and sed rate. No major differences were observed between placebo and low dose penicillamine (<500 mg/day). For higher dosages, patients on penicillamine were twice as likely to withdraw than those receiving placebo 500 to <1000 mg/day. D‐penicillamine appears be have a clinical and statistical benefit on the disease activity of patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Its benefit is similar to that of other such drugs, such as disease modifying anti‐rheumatic drugs (DMARDs). More adverse reactions are seen in patients being treated with D‐penicillamine.
