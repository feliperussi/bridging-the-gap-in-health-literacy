Holding chambers versus nebulisers for inhaled steroids in chronic asthma
In an asthma attack, the airways (passages to the lungs) narrow from muscle spasms, and from swelling (inflammation). Inhaling corticosteroid drugs can relieve this swelling, and so ease asthma. These drugs have usually been inhaled through inhalers with a holding chamber (spacer) that delivers a metered‚Äêdose, but can now also be inhaled through a wet nebuliser. The nebuliser is considerably more expensive. The review of trials found no convincing evidence that nebulisers for corticosteroids offer any improvement over inhaled steroids delivered through a holding chamber.
