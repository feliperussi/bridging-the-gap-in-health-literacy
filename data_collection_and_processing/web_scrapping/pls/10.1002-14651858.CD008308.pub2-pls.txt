Intratracheal Clara cell secretory protein (CCSP) administration in preterm infants with or at risk of respiratory distress syndrome 
There is insufficient evidence from randomised controlled trials to guide the use of CCSP administration in preterm infants at risk of respiratory distress syndrome.  Respiratory distress syndrome caused by a deficiency of the naturally occurring lining chemicals of the lung (surfactant) occurs mainly in infants born before term. The usual treatment includes instilling artificial surfactant directly into the newborn infant's trachea followed by mechanical ventilation. However, this process can lead to lung injury, which can affect the infant's long‐term health. A potential preventative strategy is to administer CCSP. This protein has the potential to reduce the lung damage caused by mechanical ventilation and thus may prevent further complications secondary to this damage known as chronic lung disease (CLD). This review found a small randomised controlled trial of intratracheal CCSP administration in preterm infants with respiratory distress syndrome that reported CCSP is well tolerated but this study did not have sufficient subjects to detect important clinical effects. In view of the encouraging results from this trial and other animal studies, high‐quality trials of intratracheal CCSP administration in preterm infants with or at risk of respiratory distress syndrome are justified.
