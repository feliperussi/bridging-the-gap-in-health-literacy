Continuous or intermittent monitoring of people with acute stroke
Blood pressure, pulse rate, body temperature, breathing and heart rhythm are important physiological variables that need to be checked frequently in people with an acute stroke. This monitoring can be carried out in different ways, particularly in well‚Äêorganised stroke units. Continuous monitoring is supported by automatic equipment connected to the patient and supervised by nurses, whereas intermittent monitoring is performed by nurses using manual and portable equipment. We searched for all trials that compared continuous monitoring with intermittent monitoring in people with acute stroke. We identified three studies including a total of 354 participants. Stroke unit care with continuous monitoring was associated with a significant reduction in the chance of being dead or disabled after the stroke. Unfortunately this evidence is not entirely reliable because of the small number of participants, differences in the definitions of abnormal results, and the less reliable methods used in the largest trial. Further research is required to answer many remaining questions, such as when to start continuous monitoring, when to interrupt it, which people should be given priority, and which treatments are most appropriate after the identification of abnormalities in physiological variables.
