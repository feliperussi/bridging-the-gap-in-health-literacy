Insufficient evidence from randomized, placebo‐controlled studies to support a recommendation that trazodone should be prescribed, or not prescribed, for BPSD 
The rationale for using trazodone is that it is a sedating atypical serotonergic antidepressant with a low rate of adverse effects and some behavioural and psychological symptoms in people with dementia (BPSD) are associated with serotonergic dysfunction. The conclusion is based on limited data from two small studies. The larger of the studies, conducted in 73 patients with Alzheimer's disease, showed no beneficial effect of trazodone at all. A smaller cross‐over study in patients with frontal lobe dementia showed a trend for reduction in some symptoms in the first study period. Larger, longer studies are needed to explore the efficacy, effectiveness and safety of trazodone.
