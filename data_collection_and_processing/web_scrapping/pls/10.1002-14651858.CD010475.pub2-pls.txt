Laquinimod, a new oral disease‐modifying drug for multiple sclerosis (MS)
Disease‐modifying therapies (DMTs) for MS currently aim to specifically reduce inflammation in relapsing MS and promote protection and repair of the nervous system in progressive MS. Laquinimod is a new oral disease‐modifying drug (DMD) with dual properties of modulation of the immune system and protection of the nervous system. The authors of this review assessed the efficacy and safety of laquinimod in patients with MS. Concerning the outcomes, they considered relapse, disability progression, inflammatory lesion, and brain atrophy. Among the pertinent literature only one study met the inclusion criteria. The study involved a total of 1106 patients with relapsing‐remitting MS and evaluated the efficacy and safety of laquinimod as unique therapy versus placebo. As far as safety was concerned, common adverse events included headache, back pain, arthralgia, diarrhoea, cough, urinary tract infection, elevated alanine aminotransferase, insomnia, nausea, abdominal pain and sinusitis. The authors were unable to give any clear recommendations for the use of laquinimod as a DMD for MS because the study was poor quality and was funded by a pharmaceutical company. Future studies with higher methodological quality are needed to assess the potential benefits and the safety in a longer period of administration.
