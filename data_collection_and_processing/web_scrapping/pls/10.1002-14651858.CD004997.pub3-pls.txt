Types of indwelling urinary catheters for long‐term bladder drainage in adults
Prolonged urinary catheterization is common amongst people in long‐term care settings, for example in nursing homes or home care. In addition, many people living in the community need to have a permanent catheter. Long‐term catheterization was defined as for more than 30 days. We identified only three trials involving 102 adults in various settings. All three trials were too small to provide reliable evidence to indicate which types of catheters are best to use in which patients.
