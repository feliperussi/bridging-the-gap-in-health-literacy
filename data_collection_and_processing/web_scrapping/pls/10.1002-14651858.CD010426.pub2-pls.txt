First‐line beta‐blockers versus other antihypertensive medications for chronic type B aortic dissection 
Background 
The aorta is the largest blood vessel in the body. It begins in the heart and provides oxygen to all parts of the body. Aortic dissection occurs when there is a tear in the inner wall of the aorta and bleeding occurs between the inner and outer walls of the blood vessel. It is a severe and often lethal complication. High blood pressure (hypertension) may be a key cause. Other risk factors may include connective tissue disorders, congenital vascular disease (abnormalities present at birth), aortitis (inflammation of the aortic wall), trauma or iatrogenic causes (problems resulting from medical treatment). Chronic type B aortic dissections are typically managed with medical therapy to reduce the stress on the aorta. Current practice guidelines suggest the use of beta‐blockers as a first‐line treatment. 
Study characteristics 
We searched scientific databases for randomized controlled trials (studies where people are randomly allocated to treated groups) comparing beta‐blockers versus other drugs used in the treatment of hypertension. The studies had to include people with thoracic aortic dissection of any cause that had not been treated with surgery. The evidence is current to January 2014. 
Key results 
We found no randomized controlled trials.
Quality of the evidence 
As of January 2014, there is no evidence to show that beta‐blockers are superior to other antihypertensive medications as a first‐line treatment. Randomized control trials are needed to determine the best treatment of chronic type B aortic dissections.
