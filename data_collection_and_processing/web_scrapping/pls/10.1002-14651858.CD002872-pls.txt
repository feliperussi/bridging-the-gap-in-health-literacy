Nebulised morphine for severe interstitial lung disease
Nebulized morphine has been reported to have some beneficial effect on breathlessness and exercise limitation in terminally ill patients with chronic lung disease. Patients with end‐stage interstitial lung disease might also benefit from treatment of breathlessness with nebulized morphine. This review evaluates the effectiveness of using nebulized morphine for breathlessness reduction in patients with interstitial lung disease. Only one small randomised controlled trial was identified. This study concluded that low‐dose nebulized morphine is of no benefit in the management of exercise‐induced dyspnoea and exercise limitations in patients with interstitial lung disease. However, the patients included in this study were relatively mild, and definitive conclusions on the effect of nebulized morphine in the reduction of dyspnoea in end‐stage interstitial lung disease requires further work.
