Pentoxifylline for treatment of sepsis and necrotizing enterocolitis in neonates
Review question 
Does the use of intravenous pentoxifylline as an adjunct to antibiotic therapy prevent death and other serious complications in newborn babies with suspected or confirmed sepsis or necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC)? 
Background 
Sepsis is a bacterial or fungal infection of the blood. NEC is a condition with gastrointestinal tract injury and infection seen in premature babies. Modifying the body's response (inflammation) to infection may decrease deaths and tissue injury after sepsis or NEC. Pentoxifylline is a drug that decreases inflammation and possibly tissue injury. We reviewed the effects of pentoxifylline in newborn sepsis and NEC. 
Study characteristics 
Six randomised controlled trials met our inclusion criteria.
Results 
We found low‐quality evidence that pentoxifylline in combination with antibiotics decreases deaths and duration of hospital stay in newborn sepsis. Pentoxifylline treatment did not affect lung, eye, or brain injury as a result of sepsis (very low‐quality evidence). We identified no adverse effects due to pentoxifylline. There were no completed studies looking at pentoxifylline treatment in NEC. We need better‐quality evidence on the use of pentoxifylline in the treatment of sepsis or NEC in the newborn.
