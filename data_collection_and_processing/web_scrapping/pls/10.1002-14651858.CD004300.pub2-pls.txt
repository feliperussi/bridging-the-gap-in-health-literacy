Vitamin A creams and lotions for nappy (diaper) rash
There is not enough evidence to support the use of vitamin A to treat nappy rash. Nappy or diaper rash is a term used to describe inflammation in babies' napkin area. Whilst nappy rash does not make babies very sick, it is very common and it causes varying levels of discomfort to infants and concern to parents. Ointments that contain vitamin A have been suggested as possible treatments for napkin rash. Our review found that there is not enough evidence to say whether vitamin A is effective for treating or preventing napkin rash; more research is needed. One small trial found that applying vitamin A in the first three months of life did not prevent napkin rash.
