Vitamin C and superoxide dismutase (SOD) for diabetic retinopathy
Diabetic retinopathy or eye disease is the leading cause of blindness in developed countries. Laser therapy currently is the primary means in the treatment of diabetic retinopathy. It nevertheless is a procedure which destroys important cells in the eye. There are theories that so‚Äêcalled free radicals (substances which are thought to be harmful to body tissues) might be influenced by new medications to prevent or slow down vision loss in people with diabetes. Preliminary studies with vitamin C and 'superoxide dismutase' suggest that they may have an important role in treatment of diabetic retinopathy.  Unfortunately, our thorough search to detect sound clinical studies with these compounds did not identify any relevant trial. Future updates of this review may find important new information about this potentially hopeful new therapy.
