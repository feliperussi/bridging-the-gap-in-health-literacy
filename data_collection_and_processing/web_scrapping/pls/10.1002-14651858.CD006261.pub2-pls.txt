Hormone contraceptives for women with sickle cell anemia
Whether women with sickle cell anemia should use hormonal birth control is unknown. Sickle cell anemia is a blood disease. This type of anemia also causes bone pain known as sickle pain crises. A concern is that women with this disease using hormonal birth control may have blood vessels blocked by blood clots or have more bone pain. Clinicians often do not prescribe these types of birth control due to these concerns. However, many women with sickle cell anemia are sexually active, are able to get pregnant and are interested in contraception. 
In October 2011, we did a computer search for studies of sickle cell anemia and birth control methods with hormones. We did not find any new trials during the update. Previously, we found one trial of 25 women with sickle cell anemia. This study found that women were less likely to have bone pain while using the injectable birth control known as Depo (a progestin contraceptive). There were no reported serious side effects of Depo. 
Since only one study has been done using just a progestin, we have little information about the use of hormonal birth control by women with sickle cell anemia. Depo appears to be a safe birth control option and may reduce the frequency of bone pain.
