Enteral antibiotics for preventing necrotizing enterocolitis in low birthweight or preterm infants 
Not enough evidence to support administering antibiotics through a feeding tube for low birth weight and new born babies to prevent necrotizing enterocolitis. Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is a serious disease that affects the bowel in the first few weeks of life. The cause is unknown but milk feeding and bacteria may contribute. NEC is more common in preterm babies, possibly because of reduced immunity. Oral antibiotics have been used to prevent NEC but there are concerns about the possible adverse effects of oral antibiotics such as resistance to bacteria. The review of trials found there was not enough evidence to support the use of antibiotics to prevent NEC in preterm and low birth weight babies. More research is needed.
