Elective repeat caesarean section versus induction of labour for women with a previous caesarean birth 
What is the issue? 
When clinicians believe that intervention is needed in a pregnancy, which is the better option for a pregnant woman who has had one or more previous caesarean births ‐ a planned caesarean section (a ‘repeat elective caesarean section’) or planned induction of labour? 
Why is this important? 
Risks and benefits are known to occur with a repeat elective caesarean section and with planned induction of labour. However, we don’t know whether evidence indicates that we can expect better outcomes with one form of care over the other. Studies done so far have had strong potential for bias, which means that results may not be reliable. 
What evidence did we find? 
We looked for randomised trials that compared outcomes in mothers and babies when an elective repeat caesarean section was planned and when induction of labour was planned. We found no trials of this type. 
What does this mean? 
Caregivers and women faced with making a decision about labour and birth after a previous caesarean section cannot be informed by randomised trial evidence. A woman should discuss with her caregivers the benefits and risks of both courses of action. She and her caregivers should come to a shared decision for action that is based on the woman’s wishes and priorities.
