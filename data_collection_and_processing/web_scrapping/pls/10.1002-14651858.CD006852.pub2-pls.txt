Corticosteroids used in addition to antiviral drugs in patients with Ramsay Hunt syndrome
Ramsay Hunt syndrome (also known as herpes zoster oticus) consists of weakness of the face due to infection with the varicella zoster virus.  Five cases arise per 100,000 of the population per year in the US.  It is more common among those over 60 and rare in children. Other symptoms may include severe ear pain and small blisters on the outer ear or in the mouth.  Prompt diagnosis and treatment (ideally within 72 hours of the onset of symptoms) are crucial to secure the best outcomes. In cases where treatment has been started within this time period, facial weakness recovers in up to 75% of patients. Standard treatment is with antiviral therapy (most commonly acyclovir). Corticosteroids are known for their anti‐inflammatory properties and are commonly used together with antivirals to reduce the inflammation in the facial nerve.  This is thought to be the cause of the facial weakness.  The aim of the review was to see if corticosteroids, used at the same time as antiviral drugs, improved outcomes in patients with Ramsay Hunt syndrome.  However the review found no trials matching the inclusion criteria, and no conclusions can be drawn about the effectiveness of using corticosteroids in this way.   It is recommended that high‐quality randomised controlled trials be undertaken to address this issue.
