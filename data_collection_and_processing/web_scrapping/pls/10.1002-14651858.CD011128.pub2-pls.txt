Drug treatments for constipation caused by antipsychotic medications
Background  Constipation is a common side effect for people taking antipsychotic medications, especially clozapine. It has been shown that clozapine reduces bowel motility, and the consequences of this are sometimes serious. For every thousand patients treated with clozapine, it is thought that 300 to 600 will suffer constipation; at least four will develop serious gastrointestinal complications (such as bowel obstruction), from which at least one will die. 
Searching 
In June 2015, we searched for trials that compared medicines used to treat antipsychotic‐related constipation (such as laxatives) against any other treatment. However, we found little useful information. We identified two relevant studies in the Chinese literature, but none in the Western literature. 
Main results  The identified studies were of short duration, very likely to be biased, and provided very low‐quality evidence. One study suggested that a glycerol suppository was less effective than acupuncture or tuina massage, and the other suggested that mannitol, an osmotic laxative, was more effective than rhubarb soda or phenolphthalein in treating constipation. 
Conclusions  Based on our results, we conclude there is currently no good quality trial‐based evidence available that can guide clinicians and patients in the pharmacological treatment of antipsychotic‐related constipation.
