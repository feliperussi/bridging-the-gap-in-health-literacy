Pneumococcal vaccines for children and adults with cystic fibrosis
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the effect of vaccinating people with cystic fibrosis against infection with pneumococcal bacteria. 
Background 
Cystic fibrosis is an inherited disease which causes mucus in the lungs to be more sticky than normal, leading to frequent lung infections and lung damage. Pneumococcus is a type of bacteria that can cause infection throughout the body. These infections can be very serious and may lead to severe illness and death. 
There are two types of vaccine that can help protect people against some forms of pneumococcus bacteria. One vaccine is used in children under two years of age and the second is used in older children and adults. This review aimed to find trials that compared vaccinations (either vaccine) to no vaccination or a vaccination with a placebo (dummy drug) to work out whether vaccinating against pneumococcus bacteria can reduce serious illness and death in people with cystic fibrosis. This is an update of a previously published review. 
Search date 
Evidence is current to 27 June 2016.
Study characteristics 
We did not find any relevant trials to include in this review.
Key results 
The evidence to support the routine use of vaccines against pneumococcal infection is not strong; however, many countries now recommend that all children receive the vaccine as part of their childhood immunisation programmes.
