No evidence so far to support use of isotonic saline as a maintenance fluid instead of hypotonic saline 
It is common practice to give intravenous (i.v.) fluids to patients with serious acute infections but there is no agreement as to what the sodium concentration of these fluids should be. Doctors have traditionally used intravenous fluid that contains a lower sodium concentration than is found normally in human serum; this is known as hypotonic saline. However, as patients with severe infections often have low sodium levels and adverse effects sometimes occur with the use of large amounts of hypotonic saline, it has been proposed to use intravenous fluids that have a sodium concentration similar to that of a healthy person âˆ’ isotonic saline. This review has been unable to find any data from randomised trials that establish which is best.
