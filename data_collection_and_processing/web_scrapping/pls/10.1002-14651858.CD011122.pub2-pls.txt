Early versus delayed erythropoietin for the anaemia of end‐stage kidney disease
Anaemia (low haemoglobin) is a common complication among people with end‐stage kidney disease (ESKD) receiving dialysis treatment. Dialysis treatment removes toxic waste products from the blood when kidneys no longer function. Anaemia treatment is based on the use of manufactured erythropoietin (EPO, a hormone that increases haemoglobin), to improve fatigue and breathlessness which are common symptoms of severe anaemia. It is widely accepted that EPO treatment should be initiated when haemoglobin levels are less than or equal to 10 g/dL (delayed onset). However, it remains unknown if there are clinical benefits or harms when EPO treatment is commenced when haemoglobin levels are greater than 10 g/dL but less than 11 g/dL (early onset). 
We conducted this review to try to determine if there are clinical benefits and harms associated with early versus delayed EPO. 
We searched the literature to 8 July 2015 but found no studies that investigated early versus delayed EPO for ESKD‐related anaemia. Benefits and harms of early versus delayed EPO remain unknown.
