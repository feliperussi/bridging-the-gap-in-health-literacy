Calorie‚Äêcontrolled diets for chronic asthma
It is thought that high calorie diets may contribute to the development of asthma. Theoretically, reducing the amount of calorie consumed as part of a diet may help to alleviate the symptoms of asthma. This review was limited by the small size of the studies and the obese population of asthma patients recruited to the study. No firm conclusions can be drawn regarding the effects of dietary manipulation, and more research is required.
