Budesonide at different doses for asthma
Budesonide is an inhaled corticosteroid used to treat the inflammation of airways (passages to the lungs) that occurs in asthma. This review presents the effects of budesonide at different doses for people with varying degrees of asthma. In patients with mild‚Äêmoderate asthma no important differences were apparent between the lowest dose (200 mcg/d) and the highest dose (1600 mcg/d) for measures of airway opening and symptoms. However, patients with more severe asthma are less likely to experience an acute worsening of their asthma control when a higher dose (1600 mcg/d) is used regularly compared to a lower dose (200 mcg/d). Future research should report results more comprehensively, and should use quality of life questionnaires.
