Surgical procedures to evacuate incomplete miscarriage
Vacuum aspiration is a safe and quick treatment for incomplete miscarriages.
Bleeding and infection generally result if the uterus is not emptied after incomplete miscarriage (where parts of the products of conception are left in the uterus). The review of two trials, involving 550 women, found that vacuum aspiration (a procedure that empties the uterus by using a vacuum source with or without electricity) was safe, quick and easy to perform. It was also less painful than dilatation and curettage, which is often done under general anesthesia in an operating room.
