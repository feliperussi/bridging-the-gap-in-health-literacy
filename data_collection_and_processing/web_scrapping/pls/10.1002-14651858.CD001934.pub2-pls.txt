Surgery versus non‐surgical interventions (voice therapy, medical treatment) for the resolution of vocal cord nodules 
Vocal cord nodules are benign, callous‐like growths on the vocal cords. Symptoms include hoarseness, throat discomfort, pain and an unstable voice when speaking or singing. They can be caused by 'voice abuse' (prolonged shouting or singing above the individual's own range) but may also be caused by infection, allergy or acid reflux. 
Vocal cord nodules can be surgically removed but may also be treated with non‐surgical voice therapy interventions (e.g. voice re‐training, rest or hygiene advice) or medical/pharmacological treatment of underlying infections, allergy or gastroesophageal reflux. 
The authors of this review sought to identify trials which compared surgical with non‐surgical treatment. They found that there was not enough evidence to compare surgery to other treatment options. More research is needed.
