What are the effects of educational interventions delivered to children and/or their families, who have experienced an emergency department visit with their asthma within the previous 12 months? 
Asthma care for children in our society is common and costly. There is now evidence that educational intervention for children who have attended the emergency department for asthma lowers the risk of the need for future emergency department visits and hospital admissions. This review looked at studies which compared usual care for asthma to more intensive educational programmes and the results showed a statistically significant reduction in the treatment groups needing subsequent emergency department visits or hospital admissions. We were not able to determine the most effective type, duration or intensity of education that should be offered to children to offer the best asthma outcomes.
