Vitamin K for upper gastrointestinal bleeding in people with acute or chronic liver diseases 
Review question  We reviewed vitamin K for upper gastrointestinal bleeding in people with acute liver disease (that is, loss of normal liver functions which occurs in days or weeks; most often, people do not have a pre‚Äêexisting liver disease) or chronic liver disease (that is, progressive destruction of normal liver functions, usually associated with fibrotic regeneration of the liver tissue). 
Background  Upper gastrointestinal bleeding (vomiting of blood) is one of the most frequent causes of morbidity and mortality in the course of liver disease. Vitamin K administration is used as a supplementary intervention, but it is unknown whether it benefits or harms people with acute or chronic liver disease and upper gastrointestinal bleeding. 
Study characteristics  We searched scientific databases for studies assessing the benefits and harms of vitamin K in people of any age with liver disease. This updated review found no randomised clinical trials (clinical studies where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups) on the benefits or harms of vitamin K for upper gastrointestinal bleeding in people with acute or chronic liver diseases. The evidence is current to February 2015. 
Key results  There is no evidence to recommend or refute the use of vitamin K for upper gastrointestinal bleeding in people with liver diseases. 
Quality of evidence  We found no randomised clinical trials.
