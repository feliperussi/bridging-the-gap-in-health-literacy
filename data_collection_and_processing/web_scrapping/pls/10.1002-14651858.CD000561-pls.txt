Antidepressants compared with placebos for depressed older people
Seventeen RCTs were identified by the systematic literature search that met our inclusion criteria and provide suitable data for analysis. We analysed these 17 placebo trials examining the efficacy of antidepressant treatment in older people. Just under 2000 patients were entered into the meta analysis. TCAs, SSRIs and MAOIs proved effective in both institutionalised and community patients. Low dose TCA treatment may be effective but further studies are needed.
