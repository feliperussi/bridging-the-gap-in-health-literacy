Prophylactic antibiotics to reduce morbidity and mortality in neonates with umbilical artery catheters 
There is not enough evidence from randomised trials to either support or refute the routine use of preventive antibiotics in newborn babies with umbilical artery catheters. Sick newborn babies occasionally require the insertion of an umbilical artery catheter [a special drip that goes into the artery in the umbilicus (belly button)]. This allows fluid and medicines to be given and blood tests to be taken. Some people believe that antibiotics should be given to all babies with umbilical artery catheters in order to reduce the chance of infection occurring. However, antibiotics can have unwanted effects. The reviewers found inadequate evidence from randomised trials to either support or refute the routine use of antibiotics for all babies with umbilical artery catheters.
