Which amphotericin B formulation better preserves kidney function among people with fungal infection? 
Fungal infections can cause ill health, and in some cases, death. Conventional amphotericin B has been used for many years to treat fungal infection. Although effective, this drug can cause kidney damage in about eight of every ten patients treated. People with kidney damage have longer stays in hospital, increased healthcare costs, and higher numbers of deaths. 
To avoid the problems known to affect people who need treatment for fungal infection, new formulations of amphotericin B (called lipid‐associated) have been developed. Liposomal amphotericin B is a new formulation and is most often used in clinical practice to treat fungal infection. 
We searched the literature published up to 10 March 2015, and identified 12 studies (2298 participants) that compared conventional amphotericin B with liposomal amphotericin B. We were able to meta‐analyse 10 studies (2172 participants). Study quality was assessed as moderate overall. 
Liposomal amphotericin B was found to be associated with fewer kidney and infusion‐related reactions than conventional amphotericin B.
