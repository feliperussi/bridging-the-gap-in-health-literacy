Mannitol for acute stroke
Brain swelling (oedema) is a major cause of early death and long‚Äêterm disability after stroke (a sudden catastrophe in the brain either because an artery to the brain blocks, or because an artery in or on the brain ruptures and bleeds). Mannitol solution is given into a vein to reduce the swelling. Increased (rebound) swelling in the brain can occur after the treatment is stopped. This review of three small trials, involving 226 participants, found that there was not enough evidence to decide if mannitol improves survival or prevents disability after stroke. The treatment can cause a number of adverse effects, but no serious adverse events were reported in the trials included in this review. More research is needed.
