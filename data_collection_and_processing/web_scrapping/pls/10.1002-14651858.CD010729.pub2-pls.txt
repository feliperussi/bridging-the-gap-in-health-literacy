Modifying therapies such as biologics, colchicine, corticosteroids, immunosuppressants and interferon‐alpha for Neuro‐Behçet's Syndrome 
Neuro‐Behçet Syndrome (NBS) is an invalidating condition with a huge impact on quality of life. Recommendations on treatments for NBS include the use of disease‐modifying therapies such as biologics, colchicine, corticosteroids, immunosuppressants and interferon‐alpha. To assess their benefit and harms, the review authors decided to perform a systematic review of the available treatments for NBS. No studies were found that met the inclusion criteria of this review, indicating that there is no evidence to support or refute the benefit of these treatments for patients with NBS. Thus, well‐conducted research is required before an evidence‐based recommendation can be supported.
