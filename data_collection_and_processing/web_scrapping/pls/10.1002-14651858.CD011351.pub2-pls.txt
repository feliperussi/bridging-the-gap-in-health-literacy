Medications for generalised itching (not caused by a disease affecting the whole body or changes in the skin (lesions) during pregnancy 
Itching, or an unpleasant sensation that provokes a desire to scratch, is one of the most common skin problems in pregnant women. It can be caused by skin diseases, diseases affecting the whole body, or simply by having dry skin, known as generalised itching. The growing uterus also stretches the skin around the belly and the skin containing oil glands which keep it moist are not able to meet the moisture requirement, leading to dry skin. For the pregnant woman, having itchy skin can add anxiety, frustration and lead to poor sleep and exhaustion. She may also cause skin damage from scratching. 
We searched the medical literature for trials (28 January 2016) to determine the effectiveness of medications and any adverse effects of the medications used for the treatment of itching. Unfortunately, we found no evidence from randomised controlled trials to assess whether medications applied directly to the skin (topically) or taken systemically for generalised itching in pregnancy are effective or safe. 
High‐quality randomised controlled trials assessing medications for generalised itching (not caused by a disease affecting the whole body or changes in the skin (lesions) in pregnant women are needed. Such studies should consider important outcomes such as relief of itching, women’s satisfaction, sleep disturbance and adverse effects of the interventions.
