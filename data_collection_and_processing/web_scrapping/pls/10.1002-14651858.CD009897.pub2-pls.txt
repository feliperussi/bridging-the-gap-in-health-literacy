Stereotactic radiotherapy for the treatment of vestibular schwannoma (acoustic neuroma)
Vestibular schwannomas, also known as acoustic neuromas, are benign tumours of the eighth cranial nerve (responsible for hearing and balance). They can be treated by surgery or stereotactic radiotherapy (precisely delivered, focused brain irradiation), or just kept under observation because they may grow quite slowly or may not grow at all. 
We searched the literature in order to find randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared stereotactic radiotherapy to other treatment methods. None of the studies we identified met the criteria for inclusion in this review. 
There is currently no high quality evidence from RCTs to determine whether any of the treatment options for patients with a vestibular schwannoma have clear advantages over the others. Treatment therefore has to be selected on an individual basis, taking into account the patient's own preferences, clinician experience and the availability of radiotherapeutic equipment. Further research is needed to compare the efficacy and safety of all the different treatment options.
