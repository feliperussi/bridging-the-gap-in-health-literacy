Bile acids may improve liver biochemistry of patients with hepatitis B or C, but there is insufficient evidence about long‐term beneficial effects 
Viral hepatitis causes significant morbidity and mortality. Based on this Cochrane systematic review, bile acids may decrease serum transaminase activities in patients with acute hepatitis B, chronic hepatitis B, or chronic hepatitis C. However, bile acids have no effects in eradicating viral markers. There is insufficient evidence either to support or to refute effects on the long‐term outcomes that include hepatocellular carcinoma, decompensated cirrhosis, and/or liver related mortality. 
No clinical trials have evaluated bile acids for patients with hepatitis A, acute hepatitis C, hepatitis D, or hepatitis E. Accordingly, bile acids should first be evaluated in adequately sized and adequately conducted randomised trials before clinical use is considered.
