Drugs for itching in adult palliative care patients
Background 
Pruritus is the medical term for itching. This symptom can be a problem in palliative care settings where treatments for cancer or severe kidney disease are given at the same time. In this updated review, we searched for high quality clinical trials of drugs for preventing or treating itch in palliative care. 
Key findings and quality of evidence 
In June 2016, we found 50 studies that tested 39 different drugs in 1916 people with itch. An ideal antipruritic (anti‐itch) therapy is currently lacking. However, there was enough evidence to point out some possibly useful treatments for particular causes of the itch. These included gabapentin, nalfurafine and cromolyn sodium for itch associated with chronic kidney disease, and rifampicin and flumecinol for itch associated with liver problems. Paroxetine may be useful for palliative care patients whatever the cause of the itching, although evidence was only available from one study. Overall, most of the drugs caused few and mild side effects. Naltrexone showed by far the most side effects. Overall the evidence ranged from very low to moderate quality. 
Further research 
Research in palliative care is challenging and often limited to a restricted period of time at the end of life. More high‐quality studies on preventing and treating itch (pruritus) are needed.
