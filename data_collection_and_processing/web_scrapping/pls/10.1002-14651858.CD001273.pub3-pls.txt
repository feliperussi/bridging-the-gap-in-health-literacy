Oral zinc supplements for treating leg ulcers
Leg ulcers (open sores, usually on the lower leg) can be slow and difficult to heal. They may take weeks or months to heal. There is a high risk of the ulcer returning. Leg ulcers often cause distress to patients and are costly for health services. Failure to heal may be due in part to poor nutrition which reduces the ability of the body to repair itself. Minerals such as zinc are necessary for good healing and so it was thought that taking zinc sulphate tablets might aid healing of ulcers. We found six trials that used zinc to treat leg ulcers but all were too small to show a benefit, even if one exists. Furthermore the methods used in the existing trials mean that their results were possibly biased. On the basis of the evidence we have so far it appears that taking zinc tablets does not improve leg ulcer healing, however better quality trials are needed.
