Enteral lactoferrin supplementation for prevention of sepsis and necrotizing enterocolitis in preterm infants 
Review question: Does administering lactoferrin with feeds decrease the risk of sepsis or necrotizing enterocolitis in preterm babies? 
Background: Preterm babies are at risk for blood infection (sepsis) and/or gastrointestinal injury (necrotizing enterocolitis, or NEC). Many babies with sepsis or NEC die or develop long‚Äêterm brain and lung injury despite treatment with antibiotics. Lactoferrin, a protein that is present in human milk, has been shown to be effective against infection when tested in animals and in the laboratory. Lactoferrin also enhances the ability of babies to fight infection. 
Study characteristics: Through literature searches updated to 20 January 2020, we found 12 studies that enrolled 5425 preterm babies and tested the effects of lactoferrin given with feeds. We also found ongoing studies that may increase the strength of our findings when their results become available. 
Key results: Lactoferrin given with feeds with or without a probiotic decreases blood infection including fungal infection in preterm infants with no adverse effects. Lactoferrin with probiotics, but not lactoferrin alone, decreases gastrointestinal injury. Clarification regarding dosing, duration, type of lactoferrin (human or bovine), and development of preterm babies is still needed. 
Certainty of evidence: Low to very low
