Nonlatex compared to latex male condoms for birth control
The male condom can prevent pregnancy by keeping sperm out of the birth canal. Nonlatex condoms can be used by people who are allergic or sensitive to latex. Some people may not have used latex condoms because they did not like them. This review compared nonlatex condoms with latex condoms. The main issues were effect on birth control, whether the condom broke or slipped, and which condom people liked. 
In December 2012, we used a computer to find randomized trials of nonlatex condoms. For the initial review, we also wrote to researchers and makers of nonlatex condoms to find other trials. We included all studies that compared a male nonlatex condom with a latex condom. 
The eZÂ·on condom did not prevent pregnancy as well as latex condoms. The Avanti and the Standard Tactylon condoms were similar to latex condoms for birth control. The nonlatex condoms broke more often than the latex condoms. However, many people liked the nonlatex condoms better. They may be useful for people who are allergic or sensitive to latex.
