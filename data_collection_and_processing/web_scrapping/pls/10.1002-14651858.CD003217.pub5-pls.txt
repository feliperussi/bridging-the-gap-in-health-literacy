Treatments that suppress or modify the immune system for multifocal motor neuropathy
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence for the benefits and harms of treatments that suppress or modify the immune system in multifocal motor neuropathy (MMN). 
Background 
MMN is a rare condition causing progressive weakness of the limbs, especially the hands and arms. This disorder is believed to be driven by an immune‐based process. The usual treatment is infusion of immunoglobulin (antibodies purified from the blood) into a vein (IVIg). This is expensive, needs to be repeated every few weeks and is not always completely effective. Immunosuppressive drugs (drugs that suppress immune responses) such as cyclophosphamide, azathioprine, ciclosporin, interferon beta‐1a, mycophenolate mofetil and rituximab have been tried as initial or add‐on treatments.   
Study characteristics 
We found only one randomised controlled trial (RCT), of a drug called mycophenolate mofetil. The trial involved 28 people with MMN. 
Key results and quality of the evidence 
The trial provided moderate quality evidence that mycophenolate mofetil, when used with IVIg, did not reduce the requirement for IVIg or improve muscle strength of trial participants with MMN. No serious side‐effects were observed. The risk of bias was low in this study. New RCTs of other immunosuppressive drugs are needed to identify beneficial treatments for MMN. 
The evidence is current to September 2014.
