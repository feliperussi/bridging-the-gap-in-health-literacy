Multicomponent fortification of human breast milk for preterm infants following hospital discharge 
Preterm infants are often much smaller than term infants by the time that they are discharged home from hospital. This review appraised trials that evaluated whether feeding these infants with breast milk fortified with added nutrients rather than unfortified breast milk would increase growth rates and benefit development. We found only two small trials (involving 246 infants) of this intervention. These trials did not provide consistent evidence that multinutrient fortification affects growth rates during infancy. Further trials are needed to resolve this question and to assess long‚Äêterm effects on growth and development.
