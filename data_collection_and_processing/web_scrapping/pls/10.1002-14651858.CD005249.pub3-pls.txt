Push versus gravity for intermittent bolus gavage tube feeding of preterm and low birth weight infants 
Review question 
In preterm or low birth weight infants receiving gavage tube feedings, does push tube feeding compared with gravity tube feeding result in increased adverse events (low oxygen saturation, low heart rate, time to full suck feeding).  
Background 
Infants born prematurely (before 37 weeks) may be unable to co‐ordinate sucking, swallowing, and breathing, and require gavage feeding. In gavage feeding, milk is delivered intermittently through a tube passed via the nose or the mouth into the stomach. Intermittent bolus milk feeds may be administered by using a syringe to gently push milk into the infant's stomach (push feed). Alternatively, milk can be poured into a syringe attached to the tube and allowed to drip in by gravity (gravity feed). 
Study characteristics 
The search is up‐to‐date as of July 2020. We included one study (31 infants) in this updated review. 
Key results 
Evidence is insufficient to show whether use of push compared with gravity gavage feeding results in more rapid establishment of full gavage feeds without increasing adverse events in preterm or low birth weight infants, or both, who require intermittent bolus gavage feeding. 
Certainty of evidence 
Evidence from randomised trials comparing push versus gravity intermittent gavage tube feeding in preterm or low birth weight infants (less than 2500 grams) is insufficient to inform practice.
