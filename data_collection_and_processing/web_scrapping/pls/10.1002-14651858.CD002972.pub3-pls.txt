Formula versus maternal breast milk for feeding preterm or low birth weight infants
Review questionDoes feeding preterm or low birth weight infants with formula rather than maternal breast milk affect growth and development? 
BackgroundArtificial formulas can be manipulated to contain higher amounts of important nutrients such as protein than maternal breast milk but newborn infants often find formula difficult to digest. Artificial formulas, furthermore, do not contain the antibodies and other substances present in breast milk that protect the immature gut of preterm or low birth weight infants and reduce the risk of infection and severe bowel problems. If preterm infants are fed with formula rather than maternal breast milk (breast‚Äêfed directly or mother's own expressed breast milk), this might increase the risk of these problems and adversely affect growth and development. Given these concerns, we planned to review the evidence from clinical trials that compared formula versus maternal breast milk for feeding preterm or low birth weight infants. 
Study characteristicsIn searches up to October 2018, we did not find any eligible randomised controlled trials. 
Key results and conclusionsThere are no trial data to answer this question. Since another Cochrane Review showed that feeding with formula compared to donor breast milk increases the risk of serious gut problems in preterm or low birth weight infants, it is unlikely that families and clinicians would consider it acceptable to allocate an infant to receive formula as an alternative to maternal breast milk when it is available.
