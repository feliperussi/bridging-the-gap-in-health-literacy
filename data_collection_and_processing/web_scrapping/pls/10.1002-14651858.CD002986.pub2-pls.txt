Ionisers for chronic asthma
Ion generators have been marketed for use in homes to remove dust and smoke particles in order to improve symptoms in people with asthma. Although complex laboratory studies show that ion generators alter airways function, the few studies which have been conducted in the homes of people with asthma, demonstrate no significant benefit in improving lung function or symptoms.
