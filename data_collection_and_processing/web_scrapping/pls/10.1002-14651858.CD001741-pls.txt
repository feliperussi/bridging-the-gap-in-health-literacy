Speleotherapy (exposure to salt air, usually underground) for asthma
Speleotherapy (staying in underground environments) is believed to be of some benefit to people with asthma. People spend short periods in specifically designated caves or mines, sometimes doing particular physical or breathing exercises. There are some wards for longer stays. Benefits are believed to come from air quality, underground climate, air pressure or radiation. These features differ among caves and mines (for example, there are high levels of radiation in some mines, and different types of humidity). No evidence from randomised controlled trials was found and more research is needed.
