Chemotherapy before surgery for patients with surgically removable cancer of the esophagus
Question 
In patients who have cancer of the esophagus that is potentiallly removable by surgery, does the use of chemotherapy before surgery result in improved survival? 
Background 
Cancer of the esophagus often is not discovered until it is at quite an advanced stage. This means that even removing the tumor through surgery is not very successful, and many people die within five years. Chemotherapy (cancer‐fighting drugs such as cisplatin) has been used before surgery to try to shrink the tumor, making it easier to operate on and stopping it from spreading. Therefore, chemotherapy may help people to live longer. 
Study characteristics 
This review included information from 13 randomized studies and combined results from 2122 patients to answer our question regarding survival. 
Key results 
This review of 13 trials, including patients with esophageal cancer of any cell type, found some evidence that cisplatin‐based chemotherapy may help them to live longer. However, chemotherapy may introduce side effects. 
Quality of the evidence 
This review used information from randomized studies that is considered to represent the highest quality of evidence.
