Low‐dose dopamine for women with severe pre‐eclampsia
No data on the use of low‐dose dopamine in women with severe pre‐eclampsia who have very low urine output. 
Pre‐eclampsia is a condition in pregnancy involving high blood pressure and protein in the urine. Most women with mild pre‐eclampsia give birth without problems. However, severe pre‐eclampsia can cause major problems with the functioning of the liver, kidneys and blood clotting. Some women also have very low urine output, which causes further complications. Drugs which help to increase urine output may possibly help with this problem. Low‐dose dopamine has been suggested as one such drug, but the review found no trials of low‐dose dopamine for women in pregnancy who have severe pre‐eclampsia complicated by low urine output. It is suggested that this drug should first be tested in non‐pregnant women with very low urine output before it is considered for trials with pregnant women, because of the potential for severe adverse effects if the dose is exceeded.
