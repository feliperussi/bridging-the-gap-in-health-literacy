Surgical release of tongue‐tie for the treatment of tongue‐tie in young babies
Review question: Tongue‐tie is a potentially treatable cause of breastfeeding problems ‐ if a baby is tongue‐tied and is having feeding difficulties, does releasing the tongue‐tie help? 
Background: Tongue‐tie is a condition whereby the membrane between the tongue and the floor of the mouth is too tight or too short. This may cause feeding problems for the baby and/or nipple pain for a breastfeeding mother. 
Study characteristics: Five randomised controlled trials enrolling 302 infants met the inclusion criteria. 
Key results: In an infant with tongue‐tie and feeding difficulties, surgical release of the tongue‐tie does not consistently improve infant feeding but is likely to improve maternal nipple pain. Further research is needed to clarify and confirm this effect. 
Quality of evidence: The quality of the evidence is very low to moderate because overall only a small number of studies have looked at this condition, the total number of babies included in these studies was low and some studies could have been better designed.
