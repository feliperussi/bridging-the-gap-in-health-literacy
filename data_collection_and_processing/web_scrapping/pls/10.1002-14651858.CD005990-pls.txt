Does Nicobrevin help people to stop smoking
Nicobrevin is a proprietary product containing quinine, menthyl valerate, camphor and eucalyptus oil marketed as an aid to smoking cessation. No randomised trials with long‐term follow‐up of smoking status were identified, so there was no evidence to assess efficacy.
