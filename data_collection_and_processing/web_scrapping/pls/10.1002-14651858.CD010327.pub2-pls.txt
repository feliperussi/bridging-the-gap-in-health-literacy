Combined ICS‐LABA for children and adults with bronchiectasis
A paucity of evidence is available to allow conclusions on whether combined inhaled corticosteroids (ICS)‐long‐acting beta2‐agonists (LABA) are equivalent or superior to placebo or ICS monotherapy for the treatment of stable or exacerbation (flare‐up) state bronchiectasis (Appendix 2). 
Review question: Is any evidence available to show that combined ICS‐LABA is superior to placebo or ICS monotherapy for the treatment of stable or exacerbation state bronchiectasis in children and adults? 
Study characteristics: A small, single‐centre, non‐blinded study that compared inhaled ICS‐LABA with high‐dose ICS. 
Key results: A single study showed some benefit of the inhaled ICS‐LABA combination over high‐dose ICS in terms of indices of clinical stability such as dyspnoea (shortness of breath), cough‐free days and number of exacerbations but failed to show significant improvement in lung function or microbiology. No data are available on children with bronchiectasis or adults with bronchiectasis during an exacerbation phase. Until further evidence becomes available, we recommend that use of combined ICS‐LABA should be individualised according to the presence or likelihood of co‐existing asthma features and risks of medications. 
Quality of the evidence: This review is based on a single study, hence the quality of evidence is substantially limited. 
Bottom line: The decision to use combined ICS‐LABA in bronchiectasis must be made for individual patients on the basis of the presence or absence of bronchial hyperreactivity, until further randomised controlled trials are conducted to answer this important question.
