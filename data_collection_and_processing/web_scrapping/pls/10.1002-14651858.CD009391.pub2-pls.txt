Brief co‐incubation of sperm and oocytes for in vitro fertilization (IVF) techniques
In standard insemination protocols for IVF, oocytes are exposed to sperm for 15 to 20 hours. Such long term co‐incubation with sperm may expose oocytes and zygotes to suboptimal culture medium due to increased levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) produced by sperm and other products of metabolism. Shortening the co‐incubation time of oocytes and sperm may possibly improve IVF outcomes by reducing the detrimental effect of ROS on the zygotes and the quality of the embryos. The brief co‐incubation method used in IVF reduces the co‐incubation time of oocytes and sperm to one to four hours. This review identified eight randomized controlled trials involving 733 women. Low quality evidence showed increases in ongoing pregnancy and clinical pregnancy rates with the use of the brief co‐incubation protocol. More studies are needed to assess whether brief co‐incubation would contribute to a higher live‐birth rate and a lower miscarriage rate compared to the standard overnight insemination protocol.
