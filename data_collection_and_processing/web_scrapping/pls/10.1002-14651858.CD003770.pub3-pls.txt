Chemotherapy delivered via the hepatic artery following surgical resection of liver metastases arising from colorectal cancer does not improve survival. 
Patients who die of colorectal cancer usually die from, or at least with, liver metastases. On the other hand, isolated liver metastases can, on occasion, be resected with a chance of cure, if metastatic disease is not present elsewhere. After liver resection is performed for colorectal cancer metastases, the most common site of treatment failure is in the remaining liver. For that reason it has been proposed that chemotherapy be given in the hepatic artery after surgery to treat microscopic disease in the remaining liver.  This systematic review assesses the randomised trials that have addressed the effective ness of this additional chemotherapy. Seven studies have been published in this field, and the combined analysis shows that survival is not improved by hepatic artery chemotherapy.
