Interventions for learning disabled sex offenders
Sex offending is of increasing public concern with calls for longer terms of imprisonment and closer supervision of such offenders in the community. Currently a variety of treatment approaches are used including medication and talking therapies, though little is known about their success rates. The small group of sex offenders with learning disabilities pose a particular challenge as talking therapies need to be modified to account for the offender's limited understanding. We could find no randomised controlled trial evidence to guide us in the treatment of learning disabled sex offenders.
