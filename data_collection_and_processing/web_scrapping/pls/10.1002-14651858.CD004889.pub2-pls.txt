Patients with refractory ascites may temporarily benefit from transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic stent‐shunts 
Refractory ascites causes substantial morbidity in patients with cirrhosis. Randomised trials have compared transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic stent‐shunts with paracentesis. Mortality, gastrointestinal bleeding, renal failure, or infection did not differ significantly between the two intervention groups. Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic stent‐shunts effectively decreased the risk of ascites fluid re‐accumulation, but was associated with an increased risk of hepatic encephalopathy.
