Behavioral interventions to promote condom use among women living with HIV
Behavioral interventions to promote condom use and/or to modify HIV sexual risk behaviours include individual counseling, skills training, coping strategies, peer education, and social and educational support. This systematic review of randomized controlled trials assessed the effects of behavioral interventions on promoting condom use among women living with HIV, a population at higher risk to other sexually transmitted infections (STIs). Based on five eligible studies, we found that behavioral interventions promoting consistent condom use in HIV‐positive women did not have a significant impact on outcomes, when compared to standard care or minimal HIV‐related support. However, these findings should be used with caution since they are based on a few small trials that were targeted specifically towards HIV‐positive women.  New research is needed to assess the potential personal and public health gains that could arise from a combination of interventions that promote safe sexual behavior and adopt a harm reduction approach, particularly in developing countries, where HIV infection rates among women remain high.
