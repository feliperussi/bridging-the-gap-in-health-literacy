Elective (regular) versus symptomatic intravenous antibiotic therapy for cystic fibrosis
Chronic infection of the airways by Pseudomonas aeruginosa in people with cystic fibrosis is associated with deterioration in respiratory function. Intravenous antibiotics are the standard therapy for pulmonary exacerbations caused by this micro‐organism. Many centres advocate the use of elective (regular) three‐monthly antibiotics to reduce the frequency of exacerbations and therefore slow the deterioration of lung function. Alternatively, intravenous antibiotics are only prescribed when symptoms indicate. Elective therapy may encourage multi‐resistance to antibiotics. This review aimed to identify randomised and quasi‐randomised controlled trials that evaluated the results of the two different approaches. No clear conclusions were identified. This review will no longer be regularly updated. Searches will still be undertaken on a two‐yearly basis by the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis & Genetic Disorders Group. If, in future, relevant trials are identified, the review will be updated again.
