Chinese herbal medicines for hypothyroidism
Review question 
What are the effects of Chinese herbal medicines for the treatment of hypothyroidism?
Background 
Hypothyroidism, also known as underactive or low thyroid, is a condition in which the thyroid gland does not produce sufficient amounts of thyroid hormones which are important for many functions of the body (metabolism). In adults hypothyroidism may cause fatigue and sluggishness, increased sensitivity to cold, constipation, pale and dry skin, brittle fingernails and hair, a puffy face, hoarse voice, unexplained weight gain, muscle aches, tenderness, stiffness and weakness, pain, stiffness or swelling in the joints, heavier than normal menstrual periods, and depression. Hypothyroidism in infants and teenagers may result in poor growth and mental development as well as delayed development of permanent teeth and puberty. 
In Chinese philosophical and medical theory, Yin and Yang are the essential components of the material universe. When Yang is deficient, it cannot produce the vital energy necessary to keep the body functioning well, and symptoms of hypothyroidism may result. Chinese herbal medicines are thought to restore Yang, but the specific mechanisms are unknown. 
Results 
We did not find any randomised clinical trial or ongoing study investigating the effects of Chinese herbal medicines for hypothyroidism and could therefore not establish the effects of this treatment.
