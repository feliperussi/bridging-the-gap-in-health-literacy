Active compression‐decompression using a hand‐held device for emergency heart massage
During standard cardiopulmonary resuscitation (heart massage) for cardiac arrest (arrest of the heart), the chest is compressed manually and repeatedly by hand. This is a temporary method that pumps blood and oxygen to the brain via the heart. During standard cardiopulmonary resuscitation, the chest is not manually decompressed. Active chest compression‐decompression is an alternative method of heart massage and uses a hand‐held suction device to compress the chest, then decompress the chest after each compression. Comparison of these techniques showed active chest compression‐decompression to have no advantage and some drawbacks compared to standard cardiopulmonary resuscitation.
