Alpha‐1 proteinase inhibitor (a1PI) for preventing chronic lung disease in preterm infants 
There is not enough evidence to show the long term effect of using Alpha‐1 proteinase inhibitor for chronic lung disease in premature babies. Inflammation of the lungs is one of the causes of chronic lung disease (CLD) in babies born before 37 weeks. Babies with CLD need extra oxygen and the disease can also cause serious long‐term problems. Lung damage is caused by the release of enzymes and other anti‐oxidants because babies with CLD have a low level of Alpha‐1 proteinase inhibitor (a1P1), a substance that stops lung tissue being destroyed. A medication version of AlP1 is sometimes given to protect their lungs. The review of the trials found that there is not enough evidence to show long term beneficial effects of a1P1. More research is needed.
