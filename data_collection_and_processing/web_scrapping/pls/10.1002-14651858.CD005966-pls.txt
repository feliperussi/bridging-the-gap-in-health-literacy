The SPf66 vaccine has little or no effect on preventing malaria
The SPf66 vaccine was one of the first malaria vaccines to be tested extensively in endemic areas. SPf66 is a synthetic peptide vaccine containing antigens from the blood stages of malaria linked together with an antigen from the sporozoite stage. SPf66 has had 10 trials in Africa, Asia, and South America. Results were initially promising, but further trials showed only a small effect in some trials, and no effect in Africa. There is no evidence that SPf66 is effective enough to be introduced on a routine basis for prevention of malaria.
