Methylxanthines for exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
Methylxanthine drugs such as aminophylline and theophylline are recommended for use in patients who have acute exacerbations (episodes) of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, particularly for patients unresponsive to standard therapies. This review identified four studies that compared these drugs with placebo. Over the first 2 hours of treatment there was no evidence that patients improved in terms of lung function, although a possible late benefit was detected. The studies do not give a clear indication of whether there was benefit in terms of reduced symptoms or hospital admissions, but side effects were found to be more common with methylxanthines. We conclude that, given current evidence, methylxanthines should not be used for acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
