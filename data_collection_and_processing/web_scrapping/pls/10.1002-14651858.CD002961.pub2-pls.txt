Critical incident audit and feedback to improve perinatal and maternal mortality and morbidity 
Recording the number and the causes of deaths of pregnant women and babies is essential health information to identify problem areas. Effective management of the health of a population is dependent on basic statistics that allow for the identification of problem areas. Recording the number and causes of deaths of pregnant women and babies falls into this category and is essential. No randomised controlled trials were identified; therefore, the depth of examination of these deaths and the methods of feeding back that information to health workers to obtain the most beneficial effect is not known.
