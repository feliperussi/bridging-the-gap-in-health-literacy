Intravenous or enteral loop diuretics for preterm infants with (or developing) chronic lung disease 
There is no strong evidence of benefit from routine use of loop diuretics in preterm babies at risk of, or with, chronic lung disease. Lung disease in babies born early (preterm) is often complicated with excess of water. Medications that reduce body water (diuretics) might help the baby recover from lung disease. The review analysed the effects of diuretics working on the deep part of the small kidney tubes (loop diuretics). The review of trials found that diuretics, given from a single dose to one week's treatment, inconsistently improved lung function and oxygen levels in the blood. There was not enough evidence to show any improvement in long‚Äêterm outcome.
