Prophylactic animal derived surfactant extract for preventing morbidity and mortality in preterm infants 
Animal derived surfactant extract improves outcomes for babies at risk of respiratory distress. 
Surfactant is essential to normal lung function in babies. Respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) is caused by a lack of, or dysfunction in, surfactant, the chemicals that line the lung air spaces and help keep the lung expanded. A variety of animal derived and synthetic surfactants have been formulated and are given to babies at risk to prevent them developing RDS. The review found that animal derived surfactant given at birth lowers rates of death and many serious and disabling conditions for babies at risk of RDS.
