Methylxanthine treatment for apnoea in preterm infants
There is some evidence that methylxanthines (caffeine and theophylline) are effective in the short‚Äêterm for reducing apnoea in premature babies. 
Apnoea is a pause in breathing of greater than 20 seconds. It may occur repeatedly in preterm babies (born before 34 weeks gestation). Methylxanthines (such as theophylline and caffeine) are drugs that are believed to stimulate breathing efforts and have been used to reduce apnoea. Adverse effects of feeding intolerance and a rapid heart rate have been found with theophylline. The review of trials found that methylxanthines help reduce the number of apnoea attacks in the short term. The one new trial included in this review that published longer term outcomes (up to term equivalent age and in later infancy) demonstrated that caffeine therapy has lower rates of longer term side effects.
