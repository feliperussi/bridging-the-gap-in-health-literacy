There is no evidence to support azathioprine for patients with primary biliary cirrhosis
Primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) is a chronic disease of the liver that is characterised by destruction of bile ducts. Estimates of annual incidence range from 2 to 24 patients per million population, and estimates of prevalence range from 19 to 240 patients per million population. PBC primarily affects middle‚Äêaged women. The forecast for the symptomatic patient after diagnosis is between 10 and 15 years. The cause of PBC is unknown, but the dynamics of the disease resemble the group 'autoimmune disease'. Therefore, one might expect a noticeable effect of administering an immune repressing drug (immunosuppressant). This review evaluates all clinical data on the immunosuppressant azathioprine in relation to PBC. 
The findings of this review are based on two clinical trials with 293 patients. The drug azathioprine was tested versus placebo or no intervention. The primary findings of the review are that azathioprine has no effect on survival, itching, progression of the disease (cirrhosis development), or quality of life. Patients given azathioprine experienced more adverse events than patients given placebo.
