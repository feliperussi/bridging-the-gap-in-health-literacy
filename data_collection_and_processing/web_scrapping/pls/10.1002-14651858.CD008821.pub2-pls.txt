Acupuncture for primary hypertension in adults
Background 
Hypertension (high blood pressure) affects about one billion people worldwide. Moreover, hypertension increases the risk of stroke and heart attack. Acupuncture is an important part of Traditional Chinese Medicine, in which thin needles are inserted into the skin at defined points. Acupuncture has been used to lower blood pressure and relieve symptoms of hypertension. 
Study characteristics 
We performed a systematic review of medical databases to find clinical trials that compared the effects of acupuncture to controls (sham (pretend) acupuncture, no treatment, or medicines) on blood pressure and safety in adults with hypertension. The results are current to February 2017. 
Key results and certainty of the evidence 
We found 22 trials including 1744 people. The trials did not look at death and general health. Four trials compared acupuncture with sham acupuncture and suggested a small short‐lasting (one to 24 hours) reduction in blood pressure. The other trials were of very poor quality. There was no evidence for a long‐lasting lowering of blood pressure by acupuncture that would be useful in the treatment of hypertension. We could not assess the safety of acupuncture as few trials reported this. At present, there is no evidence that acupuncture is useful in the management of long‐lasting hypertension. Future trials must be designed to measure a sustained blood pressure lowering effect of acupuncture.
