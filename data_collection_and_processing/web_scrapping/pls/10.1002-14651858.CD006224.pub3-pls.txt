Chinese herbal medicine (CHM) in the treatment of ectopic pregnancy.
Ectopic pregnancy is the leading cause of pregnancy‚Äêrelated deaths in the first trimester of pregnancy. Its incidence has increased to between one and two percent of pregnancies. Chinese herbal medicines have been used to treat this condition in China and other countries. The review authors investigated 281 studies that claimed to be randomised controlled trials and that used Chinese herbal medicines in the treatment of ectopic pregnancy.Only two of these studies were confirmed to be randomised controlled trials. Both trials were of poor quality in terms of design and how they were conducted.These studies did not provide clear evidence that CHM is beneficial in the treatment of ectopic pregnancy.
