The use of incentive spirometry for preventing pulmonary complications in adults people undergoing coronary artery bypass graft surgery 
Breathing complications after coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery increases hospital stay and is with associated high healthcare costs. CABG may interfere with the lungs, causing sections of them to collapse which may lead to pneumonia. Re‐inflating areas of the collapsed lung may be done by a device ‐ an incentive spirometer ‐ that reinforces a pattern of breathing which prevents and reverses the process. This device is used alone or in combination with other physiotherapy techniques. 
This update included 592 participants from seven studies (two new and one that had been excluded in the previous 2007 review). We found evidence from four small trials that incentive spirometry offers no advantage over standard post‐surgical physical therapy, or preoperative education in preventing breathing complications and pneumonia, improving lung function, or shortening length of hospital stay in patients undergoing CABG. Bigger and better designed trials are needed to determine if there is any role for incentive spirometry.
