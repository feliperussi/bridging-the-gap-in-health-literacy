Urinary alkalisation for uncomplicated urinary tract infections
Urinary tract infection (UTI) is the most common form of bacterial infection among women and can cause pain and frequent urination. 
Urinary alkalisers are medications that reduce the acidity of urine; these are commonly purchased over the counter, or prescribed by doctors to treat the symptoms of UTI. 
We aimed to investigate the benefits and harms of urinary alkalisers for the treatment of UTI. We searched the literature to 19 January 2016 but found no randomised controlled trials (RCTs) undertaken to investigate these agents that met our study inclusion criteria. We were unable to judge the benefits or harms of the use urinary alkalisers in the context of UTI. 
It is important that further research in the form of RCTs be carried out to determine the benefits or harms of urinary alkalisers.
