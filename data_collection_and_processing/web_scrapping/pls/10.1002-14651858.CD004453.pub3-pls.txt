Abdominal surgical incisions for caesarean section
In a caesarean section operation, there are various types of incisions in the abdominal wall that can be used. These include vertical and transverse incisions, and there are variations in the specific ways the incisions can be undertaken. The review of studies identified four trials involving 666 women. The Joel‐Cohen incision showed better outcomes than the Pfannenstiel incision in terms of less fever for women, less postoperative pain, less blood loss, shorter duration of surgery and shorter hospital stay. However, the trials did not assess possible long‐term problems associated with different surgical techniques.
