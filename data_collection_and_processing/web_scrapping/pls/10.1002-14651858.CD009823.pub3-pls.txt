Interventions for reducing risks and promoting inclusion of street children and young people 
Millions of children and young people are estimated to be living and working on streets around the world. Many demonstrate considerable resilience and strong coping skills but continue to be vulnerable to risks. To provide best chances for them in life, services are needed to reduce risks and prevent marginalisation from mainstream society. Thirteen studies have rigorously evaluated 19 interventions such as services to support street‐connected children and youth ‐ all in high‐income countries. Most have compared therapy‐based services versus usual shelter and drop‐in services, or versus other therapeutic/health interventions. We found mixed results among these studies but overall findings suggesting that participants receiving therapy and those provided usual services benefited to a similar level. Future research should consider the benefits of usual drop‐in and shelter services, most particularly in low‐ and middle‐income countries, and should focus on street‐connected children and young people. None of the studies included participants comparable with street children in low‐income countries, who may be on the street primarily to earn a living, or as a result of war, migration or urbanisation. Overall we assessed the quality of the evidence included in this review as low/moderate.
