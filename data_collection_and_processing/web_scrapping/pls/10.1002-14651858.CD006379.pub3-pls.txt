At this time, benzodiazepines cannot be recommended for the treatment of non‐alcohol related delirium 
A systematic review of benzodiazepine treatment of non‐alcohol related delirium discovered very few trials (one randomized, controlled study of mechanically ventilated patients, and thus poorly reflective of delirious patients as a whole; and two partially controlled studies), the results of which indicate that at this time there is no evidence to support the use of benzodiazepines in the treatment of non‐alcohol withdrawal related delirium among hospitalised patients.
