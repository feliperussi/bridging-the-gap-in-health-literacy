Opioids for neonates receiving mechanical ventilation
There is insufficient evidence to recommend routine use of opioids (e.g. morphine) to reduce pain in newborn babies (full‐term or preterm) with breathing difficulties on breathing machines. Breathing machines, which are widely used for newborn full‐term and preterm babies with breathing problems, may cause babies pain. Since newborn babies are very sensitive to pain ‐ which may have a bad effect on future development ‐ pain‐reduction with drugs (including opioids such as morphine) might be very important. This review found no evidence for routine use of opioids for newborns on breathing machines. Although relief of pain was variable, opioids were no better or worse for babies (in terms of death, strokes, future development, duration of ventilation or hospital stay) than other drugs or placebo. Further research is needed. 
This review has been superseded by a new Cochrane review (Bellù 2021).
