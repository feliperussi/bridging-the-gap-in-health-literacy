Are there effective methods to improve the process of referring patients to specialised care? 
Patients are referred to a specialist when more specialised care is needed. It has however been shown that the process by which patients are referred could be improved. Some patients may be referred to a specialist inappropriately or not be referred when they should have, or when they were referred have unnecessary tests or procedures. 
This review found 17 studies that evaluated whether educating health care professionals about referrals, changing the organisation or system of referrals, and changing the fees or payments for referrals, could improve the referral process. 
Education: The referral process will most likely improve when guidelines for referral are distributed with standard referral forms and when the health care professionals who are the consultants are involved in teaching about referring. But simply distributing guidelines and providing health care professionals with feedback about how they are referring may not improve the process. 
Organisation: There is little evidence about organisational changes. But providing a second opinion before referring, or enhancing the services provided before a referral (e.g. providing access to a physiotherapist) may improve the referral process. 
Financial: There is not enough evidence to draw firm conclusions about financial changes. Financial changes can change the number of referrals but it is not known whether they improve the quality or appropriateness of referrals.
