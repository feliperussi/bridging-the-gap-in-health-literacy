Alginate dressings for healing foot ulcers in people with diabetes mellitus
Diabetes mellitus, a condition which leads to high blood glucose concentrations, is a common condition with around 2.8 million people affected in the UK (approximately 4.3% of the population). Wound dressings are widely used to treat foot ulcers in people with diabetes. There are many types of dressings that can be used, which also vary considerably in cost. This review (six studies involving a total of 375 participants) identified no research evidence to suggest that alginate wound dressings are more effective in healing diabetic foot ulcers than other types of dressing. More, better quality research is needed.
