No evidence of efficacy of alpha lipoic acid for dementia
Alpha lipoic acid (ALA) is one of a number of potent antioxidants for which a potential therapeutic role in dementia has been postulated. This suggestion arises from the possibility that oxidative and inflammatory processes contribute to the neurodegeneration of Alzheimer's disease. Whilst ALA has been used as part of the treatment for a variety of neurological disorders, no placebo‚Äêcontrolled randomized trials have been conducted for its use in degenerative dementias. ALA for the treatment of dementia of any subtype cannot currently be recommended.
