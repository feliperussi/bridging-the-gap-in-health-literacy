Garlic for preventing pre‐eclampsia and its complications
Insufficient evidence to say if taking garlic can help to reduce the risk of pre‐eclampsia and its complications for pregnant women and their babies. 
Pre‐eclampsia is a serious complication of pregnancy occurring in about 2% to 8% of women. It is identified by increased blood pressure and protein in the urine, but women often suffer no symptoms initially. It can, through constriction of the blood vessels in the placenta, interfere with food and oxygen passing to the baby, thus inhibiting the baby's growth and causing the baby to be born too soon. Women can be affected through problems in their kidneys, liver, brain, and clotting system. Garlic may lower blood pressure (one of the problems with pre‐eclampsia) and so may have a role in helping to reduce the risk of pre‐eclampsia. The review of trials found just one study of 100 women which showed no differences between dried garlic tablets and dummy tablets. However, the study was small and there are many varying forms of garlic, some with odour and some without, fresh cloves, powdered garlic, garlic capsules etc., and there may be differences between these preparations. Further trials are needed to assess any possible effect of garlic on pre‐eclampsia and to assess any potential adverse effects.
