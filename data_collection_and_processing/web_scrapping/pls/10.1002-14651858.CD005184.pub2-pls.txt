Effectiveness of creatine analogues in cardiac disease
Creatine kinase is an enzyme that regenerates cellular ATP, which is used for energy demanding processes. This review evaluated existing therapeutic strategies that target the creatine kinase system in cardiovascular disease. The available trials indicate an improvement in abnormal heart rhythm and shortness of breath in heart disease. The effect on death and the size of myocardial infarction and the heart function were unclear. Given the small sample size of the discussed trials and the heterogeneity of the population included in these reports, larger clinical studies are needed to confirm these observations.
