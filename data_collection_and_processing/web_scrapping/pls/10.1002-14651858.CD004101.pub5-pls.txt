Cognitive‐behavioural treatments for non‐cardiac chest pain
Recurrent chest pain in the absence of coronary artery disease is a common, difficult to treat problem that sometimes leads to excess use of medical care. A substantial number of patients are not reassured by negative medical assessment, reporting persistent pain and limitations. Psychological factors appear to be of importance for treatment. This Cochrane review included all studies of psychotherapy for non‐cardiac chest pain. Seventeen trials met the inclusion criteria, and included a total of 1006 participants. The review found that cognitive‐behavioural treatments are probably effective (in terms of reduced chest pain frequency) in the short term, for the treatment of non‐cardiac related chest pain. No adverse effects of the psychotherapy were found. Hypnotherapy is also a possible alternative. A limitation of this review is the high variability of the studies included, reflected in a wide range of outcome measures, although there was an overall fairly low risk of bias.
