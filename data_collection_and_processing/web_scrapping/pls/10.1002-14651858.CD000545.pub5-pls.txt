Azathioprine or 6‐mercaptopurine for the treatment of active Crohn's disease
Azathioprine and 6‐mercaptopurine are immunosuppressive drugs that are thought to reduce inflammation by blocking the immune system. This review includes 13 randomized trials with a total of 1211 participants. Azathioprine and 6‐mercaptopurine were found to be possibly more effective than placebo (fake medicine) for inducing remission in Crohn's disease. There is evidence to suggest that the combination of azathioprine and infliximab is superior to infliximab used as a single drug for induction of steroid‐free remission in active Crohn's disease. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) alpha blocking drugs like infliximab may provide an alternative treatment for patients who do not respond to corticosteroid or immunosuppressive drug treatment. Azathioprine and 6‐mercaptopurine may reduce the need for steroid treatment and their use may therefore lead to a lower incidence of steroid related side effects. However, these drugs are slow acting and are associated with some rare, but serious side effects. In some patients they suppress formation of blood cells that fight off infection and allow blood to clot and they occasionally cause inflammation of the pancreas. These drugs have also been associated with an increased risk of lymphoma. For these reasons careful consideration needs to be given to the use of these drugs in patients with active Crohn's disease.
