Enamel matrix derivative (EmdogainÂ®) for periodontal tissue regeneration in intrabony defects 
Emdogain might have some advantages over other methods of regenerating the tissue supporting teeth lost by gum disease, such as less postoperative complications, but has not been shown to save more compromised teeth or that patients noticed any aesthetic improvement 1 year after its application. Bacteria in plaque can cause gum disease (periodontitis) that breaks down tissue supporting teeth. Surgical cleaning tries to stop the disease to save loose teeth. Bone grafting, guided tissue regeneration and enamel matrix derivatives (such as Emdogain) aim to regenerate support tissues. Emdogain contains proteins (derived from developing pig teeth) believed to regenerate tooth attachment. The review found that adjunctive application of Emdogain regenerates about 1 mm more tissue than surgical cleaning alone, although it is unclear to which extent such improvement is noticeable since patients did not find any difference in the aesthetic results. Emdogain showed similar clinical results to guided tissue regeneration, but is simpler to use and determines less complications. Bone substitutes may induce less gum retraction than Emdogain. No serious adverse reactions to Emdogain were reported in trials.
