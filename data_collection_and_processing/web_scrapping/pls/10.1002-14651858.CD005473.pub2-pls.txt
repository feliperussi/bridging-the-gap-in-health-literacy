Medication augmentation for treatment‐resistant anxiety disorders
Anxiety disorders are highly prevalent and result in substantial socio‐economic and personal costs. A significant proportion of patients with anxiety disorders fail to respond to first‐line medication interventions. This was a systematic review of 28 short‐term randomised controlled trials of medication augmentation for the treatment of such individuals (740 participants). A significantly larger proportion of patients responded to medication (31.8%) than to placebo (13.6%), (nine trials, 250 participants). Symptom severity was also significantly reduced (14 trials, 337 participants). A substantial proportion of the efficacy evidence base was for the augmentation with antipsychotics of serotonin reuptake inhibitors for obsessive compulsive disorder.
