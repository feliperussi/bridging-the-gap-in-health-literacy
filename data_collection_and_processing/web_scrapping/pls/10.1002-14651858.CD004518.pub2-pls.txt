Passiflora for the treatment of anxiety disorders in adults
Anxiety is a very common mental health problem in the general population. Passiflora, a herbal medicine, could be an option for treating anxiety if shown to be effective and safe. This review summarised the evidence from currently available studies on passiflora. Only two studies were eligible for inclusion, involving a total of 198 participants. One study showed that passiflora was as effective as benzodiazepines, with similar dropout rates between the two treatments. Given the lack of studies, it is not possible to draw any conclusions on the effectiveness or safety of passiflora in the treatment of anxiety disorders.
