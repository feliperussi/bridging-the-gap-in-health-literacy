Elective high frequency jet ventilation versus conventional ventilation for respiratory distress syndrome in preterm infants 
High frequency jet ventilation may help reduce chronic lung disease in preterm babies but adverse effects are unclear. Lung disease is a major cause of death in very low birth weight babies. Chronic lung disease (CLD) following mechanical ventilation for babies with breathing difficulties is also common. It is possible that the low gas exchange in newborns during breathing may help cause chronic lung disease. Elective high frequency jet ventilation (HFJV) is one type of mechanically assisted breathing method that may improve gas exchange in neonates without injuring the lung. The review of trials found there may be benefits of HFJV but not enough evidence of adverse effects. More research is needed.
