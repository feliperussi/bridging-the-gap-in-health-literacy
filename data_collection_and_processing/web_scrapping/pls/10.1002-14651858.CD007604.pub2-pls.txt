Fluid restriction and prophylactic indomethacin versus prophylactic indomethacin alone for prevention of morbidity and mortality in extremely low birth weight infants 
Respiratory and long‐term neurosensory outcomes are common morbidities among extremely low birth weight (ELBW),(birth weight less than 1000 g) survivors. Patent ductus arteriosus (PDA), a connection between vessels of the heart, is one of the known causes of respiratory morbidity. Indomethacin (a drug given early to close PDA) prophylaxis studies fail to show an improvement in the incidence of respiratory and long‐term outcomes, although there is a 50% reduction in the incidence of PDA. The addition of fluid restriction to indomethacin therapy might prove helpful. However, our review found no studies to answer this question.
