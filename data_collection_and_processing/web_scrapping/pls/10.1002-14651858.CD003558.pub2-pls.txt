Inhaled corticosteroids versus sodium cromoglycate in children and adults with asthma
Inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) and sodium cromoglycate (SCG) have been advocated as medications to control persistent asthma symptoms among children and adults, yet information on which class of drugs is superior has been conflicting. This study pooled randomized controlled trials that directly compared the effects of ICS to SCG on measures of lung function, asthma control, and health care use. Results suggest that ICS were superior to SCG on measures of lung function and morbidity. The results were consistent among children and adults. There were no differences in adverse effects between ICS and SCG, although inconsistent reporting and insufficient long‚Äêterm monitoring prevents firm conclusions on safety from being drawn.
