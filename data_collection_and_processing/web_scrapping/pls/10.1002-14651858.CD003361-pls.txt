Beta‐blockers may be able to help relive tremor for people with Parkinson's disease, but more research is needed on safety and effectiveness. 
Tremor is one of the main symptoms of Parkinson's disease, and it can be embarrassing and limit daily activities. The drugs most commonly used for Parkinson's disease tend to be more effective in treating other symptoms of the disease (such as rigidity or slowness of movement). Beta‐blocker drugs are used to relieve tremor from other conditions. However, the review found there is not enough evidence from trials to show whether beta‐blockers are safe and effective for tremor in Parkinson's disease. The blood pressure lowering effect of beta‐blockers may be a problem to people with Parkinson's disease and normal blood pressure.
