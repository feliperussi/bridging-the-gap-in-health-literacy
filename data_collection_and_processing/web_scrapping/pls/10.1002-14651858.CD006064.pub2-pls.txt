Breast examination during pregnancy for promoting breastfeeding
The rationale for breast examination during pregnancy is to determine whether any problems with breastfeeding can be anticipated and to use the opportunity for the healthcare provider and pregnant woman to discuss breastfeeding. Examination by a healthcare provider is recommended in some countries. Breast examination can also be performed by the pregnant woman herself. Furthermore, breast examination during pregnancy has been recommended as a screening method for breast cancer, although no evidence has been found to support breast examination by a doctor, nurse or the woman as a primary screening technique for breast cancer. A womanâ€™s breasts are often tender and swollen during pregnancy. This makes examination difficult and potentially compounds a woman's feelings of discomfort or vulnerability. Some women may find a clinical breast examination during pregnancy intrusive, and identification of flat or inverted nipples may actually act as a deterrent to breastfeeding. No randomised controlled trials were identified to guide a decision on whether antenatal breast examination promotes breastfeeding. Ideally, policies that govern the care of pregnant women should be evidence based and impact on any disease outcomes.
