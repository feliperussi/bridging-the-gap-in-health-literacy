Near‐infrared spectroscopy for fetal assessment during labour
There are no randomised trials that assess the effects of near‐infrared spectroscopy monitoring for lack of oxygen to babies' brains during labour. 
Near‐infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) is a light‐based way of measuring oxygen flows through the brain. It can be used to try and see if a fetus is at risk of brain injury from lack of oxygen during labour. NIRS involves inserting a cable through the cervix (opening of the womb) and next to the baby's head. Near‐infrared light is then transmitted through the skull and brain. The review found no trials assessing the effects of NIRS in labour.
