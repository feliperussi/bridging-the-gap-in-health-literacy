Erythromycin for preventing and treating preterm infants with feeding difficulties
There is not enough evidence to show any benefit from erythromycin used in large or small doses for the prevention or treatment of feeding problems in premature infants. Premature infants who need intensive care often have feeding problems. Frequently, some food stays in the stomach without being digested. Earlier feeding can facilitate normal development of the gastrointestinal tract and can avoid health problems related to feeding by intravenous lines. Erythromycin is an antibiotic that has an effect on the gastrointestinal tract and may help infants with feeding problems. However, this review found that there is not enough evidence to recommend the use of erythromycin in small or large doses to prevent or treat premature infants with feeding problems.
