Still waiting for evidence about whether cranberries are a useful treatment for urinary tract infections 
Cranberries contain a substance that can prevent bacteria from sticking on the walls of the bladder. This may help reduce bladder and other urinary tract infections (UTIs). Cranberries (usually as cranberry juice) have been used to try and treat UTIs, particularly in high risk groups such as older people. Cranberries have few adverse effects. The review found no evidence from studies about the effects of cranberry juice or other cranberry products on UTIs.
