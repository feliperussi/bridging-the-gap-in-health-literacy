Interventions to reduce pain during sterilization by hysteroscopy
Sterilizing women to permanently prevent pregnancy can be done using abdominal surgery or using a hysteroscopy procedure. While the hysteroscopy procedure isÂ less invasive than abdominal surgery, women may experience more pain with the hysteroscopy procedure when it is performed in a doctor's office. Concern about pain may influence women's decisions to have the hysteroscopy for sterilization procedures. This review evaluates the impact of interventions to reduce the pain associated with sterilization by hysteroscopy. 
We found two studies that compared two different kinds of pain reduction methods (a cervical shot and pain treatment with medications injected through the veins, i.e. intravenous or IV). Similar rates of pain were reported by women whose cervix was injected with lidocaine (a medicine that blocks pain) compared to women whose cervix was injected with salt water (placebo). However, at some points during the procedure, women who had the lidocaine rated their pain lower than women who had the salt water. Similarly, women who had IV pain treatment reported about the same pain overall as women given pain pills. However, the women with IV pain treatment reported less pain as the procedure continued. 
The two studies do not give us enough information about which pain treatment was better for sterilization by hysteroscopy.
