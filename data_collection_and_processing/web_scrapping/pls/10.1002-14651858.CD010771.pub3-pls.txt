A structured interview for assessing change in memory and other thinking skills (the IQCODE) for assessment of possible dementia 
Numbers of people with dementia and other memory and thinking problems are increasing globally. Early diagnosis of dementia is recommended but there is no agreement on the best approach or how non‚Äêmemory specialists should assess patients. A potential strategy is to interview friends or family of the subject to assess for change in memory or other thinking skills. Various methods for this "collateral" interview are available and the most commonly used is called the Informant Questionnaire on Cognitive Decline in the Elderly (IQCODE). We searched differing databases of published research for all papers relating to the accuracy of IQCODE for detecting dementia. We found only one study that tested diagnostic accuracy of IQCODE in a primary care/general practice setting. The study was of a select population (Japanese Americans) and the results may not be applicable to patients in other countries. We also noted issues in the study methods used and the reported results. Based on this single study we are unable to give guidance on how well IQCODE may function as a dementia assessment in primary care. More research is needed in this area as many patients with memory or thinking problems will first consult their general practitioner / family doctor.
