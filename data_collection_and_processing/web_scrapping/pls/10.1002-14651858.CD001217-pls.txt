A combination of graduated compression stockings and heparin seems to be the optimal prophylaxis for patients undergoing colorectal surgery. 
Patients undergoing surgery of the large bowel and the rectum have a considerable risk of developing vascular complications expressed as venous thrombosis and/or thrombosis in the lungs (pulmonary embolism). These complications can lead to lifelong impaired venous function in the legs or occasionally sudden postoperative death. In order to avoid these complications, patients are often treated with blood‐thinning medicine (anticoagulation) and graded compression stockings during operation. A combination treatment of Heparin and TED‐stockings have been proved effective in general surgery. This review demonstrates that this combined treatment also is effective within the high‐risk group of patients undergoing surgery of the large bowel or rectum.
