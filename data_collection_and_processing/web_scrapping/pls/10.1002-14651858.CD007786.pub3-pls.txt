Drugs to prevent nausea and vomiting in children and young people undergoing chemotherapy
Background 
The use of chemotherapy to treat cancer in children and young people can produce nausea (a sensation that one might vomit) and vomiting. These extremely unpleasant sensations continue to be a problem despite better antiemetic (antisickness) drugs. 
Review question 
How effective are medications to prevent nausea and vomiting in children and young people undergoing chemotherapy? 
Key results 
We found only 34 properly randomised trials that had been undertaken in children, which examined 26 drug combinations. Trials tended to report vomiting rather than nausea, even though nausea is generally a more distressing experience. We could make no firm conclusions about which drugs are best, what dose of drug is most effective, or whether it is better to receive treatments orally (by mouth) or intravenously (injected). It seems that the 5‚ÄêHT3 antagonists (the 'trons', for example ondansetron, granisetron, or tropisetron) are better than older agents, and that adding dexamethasone to these drugs makes them even more effective. Further research should consider what patients and families deem to be important, use established measures of nausea and vomiting, and attempt to use even newer techniques in the undertaking of reviews in order to maximise the information available.
