Including chemotherapy in the treatment of high‐grade glioma improves survival
High‐grade glioma is a brain tumour that is difficult to treat successfully. Standard treatment is by surgery to reduce the tumour size, followed by radiotherapy. Adding chemotherapy to the treatment results in a small but significant prolongation of survival. Few of the original studies measured quality of life during and post chemotherapy, so it was impossible to assess this. Further randomized controlled trials, which include quality of life assessment, are encouraged.
