Use of inhaled nitric oxide in patients with acute respiratory failure with low blood oxygen does not improve survival 
Background 
When a person has acute respiratory failure, some physicians administer nitric oxide (NO), which is a colourless gas that can dilate the pulmonary vasculature. This gas has been hypothesized to improve acute respiratory failure, as it could improve oxygenation by selectively improving blood flow to healthy lung segments. 
Our objective was to evaluate whether this treatment improves outcomes of adults and children with acute respiratory failure. 
Study characteristics 
We included in this updated review 14 trials with 1275 participants. We found the overall quality of trials to be moderate, with little information provided on how experiments were carried out. Results were limited, and most included trials were small. In most trials, we identified risk of misleading information. Thus, results must be interpreted with caution. The evidence is up‐to‐date to 18 November 2015. 
Key results 
No strong evidence is available to support the use of INO to improve survival of adults and children with acute respiratory failure and low blood oxygen levels. In the present systematic review, we set out to assess the benefits and harms of its use in adults and children with acute respiratory failure. We identified 14 randomized trials comparing INO versus placebo or no intervention. We found no beneficial effects: despite signs of oxygenation and initial improvement, INO does not appear to improve survival and might be hazardous, as it may cause kidney function impairment.
