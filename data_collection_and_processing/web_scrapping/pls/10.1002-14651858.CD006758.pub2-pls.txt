Human albumin for hypotension in haemodialysis patients
Intradialytic hypotension (IDH), which is caused by a decrease in blood volume, is a common complication of haemodialysis treatment. It is characterized by a sudden drop in blood pressure with symptoms of nausea, sweating, cramping, or dizziness and causes much discomfort to the patient. IDH is managed by giving fluids to the patient. These can include saline, albumin or other fluids such as gelatins and starches. Because albumin is a relatively rare and expensive blood product, we asked if albumin had an advantage over other fluids to treat IDH. We found one trial comparing albumin to normal saline; no trials were found comparing albumin to other fluids used to treat hypotension. This trial showed no difference between albumin and normal saline in all outcomes except for the amount of additional saline given, which was less in the group treated with albumin. We concluded that normal saline should be the first choice for treating IDH.
