Audit filters for improving trauma care
Major injuries are a significant cause of death and decreased quality of life worldwide. Previous research has shown that when severely injured patients are managed in an organized system of care that includes treatment by paramedics, transportation to a hospital that has specialist doctors available to treat their injuries, and additional health personnel to help them to rehabilitate, patients are more likely to survive and suffer fewer disabilities. 
There are a number of ways that the quality of care provided to injured patients in a trauma system can be determined and improved. Trauma audit filters are descriptions of specific actions that should be taken, timeframes in which tests or treatments should be provided, or outcomes that are expected to occur in injured patients. Reviewing the charts of patients whose care deviates from that described by an audit filter and providing feedback to the clinicians involved in that patient's care is expected to provide a means of correcting errors and improving future performance. 
Our study tried to determine how effective audit filters are at improving trauma care.
We were unable to find any studies to include in the review. More studies are needed to determine if audit filters are effective in improving care and, if they are, how effective they are in comparison to other quality improvement strategies.
