Conservative interventions for shaft fractures of the forearm bones in children
The forearm consists of two bones, the radius and the ulna. Fractures (broken bones) in the middle portion (shaft) of one or both of these bones are common injuries in children. Most of these fractures are treated conservatively (i.e. without surgery). Conservative treatment usually involves gently putting the broken bone back into place (reduction). Part of the arm is then put in a cast to protect and support the broken bones while they heal. There are different ways of immobilising the injured arm. For example, some casts include the elbow whereas others do not. When casts include the elbow, the elbow may be in a bent or extended position. While these fractures usually heal, the results are not always satisfactory and sometimes there are complications. This review aimed to find out which conservative treatment methods give the best results for children with these fractures by looking at the evidence from randomised controlled trials comparing different conservative interventions. 
While we found two completed trials, both were published only in conference abstracts that failed to provide any usable data. We also found two ongoing trials. In all, the review found no evidence from randomised trials to inform on the best ways to treat these fractures.
