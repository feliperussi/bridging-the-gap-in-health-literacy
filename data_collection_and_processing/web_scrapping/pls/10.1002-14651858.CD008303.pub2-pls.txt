Preventing death from blood clots, the formation of blood clots and blood clots in the lungs in people who have had physical trauma 
Thromboembolism (unwanted clotting of the blood) is a frequent complication in people who have experienced physical trauma and is also an important cause of death. The type of trauma, association with vascular injuries, and prolonged hospital bed rest are known risk factors for the development of deep vein thrombus (clot in veins of lower extremities) that can travel (embolize) to the lungs and cause death. Because of this it is usually recommended that people who have had major trauma are given mechanical or pharmacological treatments to prevent their blood forming unwanted blood clots. Mechanical interventions can include compression stockings, an air‚Äêfilled plastic tube that presses around the leg, a metal blood clot filter placed inside a vein; pharmaceutical drugs include unfractionated heparin, low weight molecular heparin, anticoagulants (e.g. warfarin), antiplatelet drugs (e.g. aspirin) and others. Sixteen studies involving 3,005 people are included in this review. We did not find strong evidence that either mechanical or pharmacological interventions reduce death or clots travelling to the lungs, but we found some evidence that they can prevent clots from forming in the legs.
