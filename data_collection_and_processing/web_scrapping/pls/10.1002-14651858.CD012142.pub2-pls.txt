Early planned removal of umbilical venous catheters to prevent infection in newborn infants 
Review question  In newborn infants with an umbilical venous catheter, how does planned removal within two weeks after insertion compare with an expectant approach or a longer fixed duration in preventing bloodstream infection and other complications? 
Background  Preterm and sick term newborn babies may require an umbilical venous catheter (UVC) ‚Äê a fine plastic tube that is inserted via the infant's umbilical vein (in the tummy button) several centimetres into the infant's major blood vessel to deliver nutrition and drugs. Infection in the bloodstream is a frequent and harmful complication for newborn infants who have a UVC in place. One method that may be used to reduce the risk of this and other serious complications is removal of the UVC within about two weeks after insertion (rather than leaving it until no longer required) and replacement with a cannula or a catheter inserted via a small vein (usually in the arm or leg). 
Study characteristics  We found only one small randomised controlled trial (including 210 very low birth weight newborn infants) that addressed this question. 
Key results  This trial did not show that early planned removal of UVCs from infants could reduce their chance of developing a bloodstream infection. However, because the trial was small, this finding is not certain. 
Conclusions  The trial did not provide sufficient evidence to inform policy or practice; larger trials are needed to resolve this question fully.
