Statins for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence on the effects of statins on adults with COPD. We found eight relevant studies. 
Background 
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is the name for a group of progressive lung conditions that cause breathing difficulties. This group includes emphysema and chronic bronchitis. Statins are medicines that can help lower the level of cholesterol in the blood. It has been suggested that through their anti‚Äêinflammatory properties statins might help reduce the number of exacerbations in people with COPD. 
Study characteristics 
We included eight studies involving 1323 participants comparing the benefits and harms of statins and placebo (an identical looking treatment with no therapeutic benefit) in people with COPD. 
Key results 
We found that statins reduced the level of inflammation in people with COPD but that this did not result in any clear improvement in exacerbations, mortality, functional capacity, quality of life, or lung function. Statins were generally well tolerated and were associated with few adverse effects. 
Quality of the evidence 
This evidence was of low or moderate quality, and most came from trials of short duration.
This review is current to May 2019.
