Piracetam for acute ischaemic stroke
Ischaemic stroke is the third leading cause of death in developed countries, and the first leading cause of long‚Äêterm disability in survivors. Piracetam is a drug which has been marketed by drug companies in several countries for many years as a 'nootropic' agent: a drug which has metabolic activity in the human brain. Experiments in animals suggest that piracetam could have beneficial effects in patients with acute stroke. The efficacy and safety of piracetam in patients with acute stroke have not yet been proven. There have been a number of randomised controlled trials of piracetam given to patients within 48 hours of the onset of their stroke. Data from three trials, involving 1002 patients, were available for this review, but almost all came from a single study. The data reviewed did not provide conclusive evidence about the effects of piracetam for acute stroke. One additional, large study has been conducted and interrupted by the manufacturer after some preliminary analyses were carried out, but the results have not been made available to the scientific community.
