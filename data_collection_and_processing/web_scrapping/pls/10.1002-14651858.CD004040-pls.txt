Olanzapine compared to placebo or other medicine as treatment for mania
High withdrawal rates from the trials limit the confidence that can be placed on the results. Olanzapine was superior to placebo in reduction of manic symptoms both as monotherapy and combined with mood stabilizers, though caused weight gain. Olanzapine was more efficacious than divalproex and caused less nausea but more weight gain, somnolence and movement disorders. Olanzapine was comparable to haloperidol in efficacy, caused less movement disorders but greater weight gain.
