Corticosteroids versus placebo and NSAIDs for rheumatoid arthritis
Short‐term low‐dose corticosteroids compared with placebo and nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs in patients with rheumatoid arthritis 
Corticosteroid drugs can relieve inflammation, and in high doses they have a dramatic effect on the symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis. They are used only temporarily, however, because of serious adverse effects during long‐term use. The review found that corticosteroids in low doses are very effective. They are more effective than usual anti‐arthritis medications (non‐steroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs, or NSAIDs). The risk of harms needs to be considered, however, especially the risk of fractures and infections.
