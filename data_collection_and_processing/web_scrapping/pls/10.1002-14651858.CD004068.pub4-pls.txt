Postnatal parental education for optimizing infant general health and parent‐infant relationships 
The benefits of post‐birth parental education for infant health or care and parent‐infant relationships remain unclear. 
Parenting is important in the development of healthy children. New parents have much to learn soon after the birth of an infant and parents do not always have social support or role models to follow. This makes it essential to examine the effectiveness of interventions used by health personnel to educate new parents about caring for their newborn infants in the best possible way. This review sought to assess educational programs delivered to one or both parents individually or in a group in the first two months after birth. Although the review identified 27 trials involving 3949 mothers and 579 fathers, only 15 (2922 mothers and 388 fathers) provided useable data on outcomes of interest. Infant sleep, crying, and maternal knowledge of infant behaviours were the only outcomes that could be effectively analyzed. Results showed that educational interventions aimed at sleep enhancement increased the amount of infant sleep by an average of 29 minutes in 24 hours but had no significant effect on the average infant crying time in 24 hours at six weeks and 12 weeks of age. Education on infant behaviour increased mothers' knowledge of infant behaviour four weeks after birth by an average of 2.85 points. Further research is required.
