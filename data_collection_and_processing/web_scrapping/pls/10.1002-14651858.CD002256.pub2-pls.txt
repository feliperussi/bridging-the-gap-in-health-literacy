Treatments for symptomatic urinary tract infections during pregnancy
Antibiotics are very effective at clearing urinary tract infections in pregnancy, and complications are very rare. 
Infections in the urinary tract are common in pregnancy. These include infections with no symptoms (asymptomatic bacteriuria), cystitis (bladder infection) and pyelonephritis (kidney infection). Such infections can cause some serious complications for the woman, and may lead to problems for the baby. The review of 10 trials, recruiting a total of 1125 pregnant women, found that several types of antibiotic had very high cure rates of cystitis or pyelonephritis during pregnancy, while complications from treatment were very rare. However, the studies could not show if any particular drug was preferable.
