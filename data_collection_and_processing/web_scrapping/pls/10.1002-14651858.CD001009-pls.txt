Does mecamylamine help people to stop smoking
Mecamylamine is a drug originally marketed for lowering blood pressure, which was found to block the rewarding effects of nicotine. At doses high enough to do this, though, mecamylamine can have significant adverse effects, including drowsiness, hypotension and constipation. It has been suggested that smaller doses may work well with nicotine replacement therapy (NRT), and the two therapies may offset each other's adverse effects. Our review of trials found that while mecamylamine did not have a great effect on quitting rates, it may enhance the effectiveness of NRT and is worth further research.
