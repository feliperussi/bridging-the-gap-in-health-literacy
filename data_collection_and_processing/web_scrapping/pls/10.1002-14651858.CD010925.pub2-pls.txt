Treatment for fatigue in Parkinson's disease
At least one‐third of people with Parkinson's disease complain about fatigue. It is unclear what treatment is best to reduce fatigue in people with Parkinson's disease. 
We reviewed the medical literature up to April 2015, and found 11 studies that included a total of 1817 people. Nine studies investigated the effects of medication (i.e. levodopa‐carbidopa, memantine, rasagiline, caffeine, methylphenidate, modafinil or doxepin) on fatigue. Two studies investigated the effects of exercise on fatigue. We found no studies that investigated the effect of cognitive‐behavioural therapy. 
We found that doxepin (one study, 12 people, low quality evidence), a drug to treat depression, may reduce fatigue. We found that rasagiline (one study, 1176 people, high quality evidence), an anti‐Parkinson drug, reduced or slowed down the progression of physical fatigue. Most drugs were safe; however, levodopa‐carbidopa (one study, 361 people, high quality evidence) may cause nausea. 
We found no evidence that exercise (two studies, 57 people, low quality evidence) reduces fatigue in Parkinson's disease. 
Based on the current evidence, it is not clear what treatment is most effective to treat fatigue in people with Parkinson's disease. Future studies should investigate the effect of cognitive‐behavioural therapy on fatigue in people with Parkinson's disease.
