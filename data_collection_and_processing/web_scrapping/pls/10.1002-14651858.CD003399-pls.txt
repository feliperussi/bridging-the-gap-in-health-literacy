Homoeopathy for induction of labour
There is not enough evidence to show the effect of homoeopathy for inducing labour. Sometimes it is necessary to induce labour (getting labour started artificially) when a pregnant woman or her unborn child are at risk. Homoeopathy involves the use of diluted substances which in their undiluted form, cause certain symptoms. The principle is that a homoeopathic substance will stimulate the body and healing functions so that a state of balance is gained and symptoms are relieved. The review of two trials, involving 133 women, found there was not enough evidence to show the effect of a homoeopathy as a method of induction. More research is needed.
