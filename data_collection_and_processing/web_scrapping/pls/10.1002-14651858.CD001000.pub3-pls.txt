Does taking inhaled steorids either before or after being intubated (having a tube down the throat to help you breathe) prevent the painful swelling that can result? 
When people in intensive care need assistance breathing, they may need to have a breathing tube inserted down through their windpipe (trachea or airway ‐ the passage to the lungs). After it is taken out (extubation), the airways can be swollen (inflamed). This swelling can make it hard to breathe, cause stridor (noisy breathing), and the tube may need to be replaced. Corticosteroids are anti‐inflammatory drugs that might reduce this swelling. The review of 11 trials involving 2301 people found that using corticosteroids to prevent (or treat) stridor after extubation has not been proven overall effective for babies or children, but this intervention does merit further study particularly for those at high risk to fail extubation. For high risk adults, multiple doses of corticosteroids begun 12‐24 hours before extubation appear to be helpful.
