Pharmacological interventions for hypertensive emergencies
Hypertensive emergencies occur when high blood pressure is associated with the presence of acute end organ damage, such as heart attack or stroke. There is controversy as to when and which blood pressure drugs to use in these situations. This review looked for all studies where patients were randomized to one or more treatments to measure the effects of such therapies. The questions of the review were to see whether drug treatments affected death or cardiovascular morbidity or whether there were differences between drug treatments. The available evidence was insufficient to answer these questions.
