Supplemental oxygen for the treatment of prethreshold retinopathy of prematurity
Increased oxygen supplementation for babies with signs of worsening retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) may not prevent development of this eye disease, and may lead to lung complications. Very preterm babies are at risk of damage to their sight from ROP (retinopathy of prematurity). Oxygen plays a part in the development of ROP. The amount of oxygen babies receive in neonatal intensive care is very carefully monitored to try to lower the risk of ROP and limit the possibility of lung damage. One option is increasing the oxygen level to babies who are showing signs of worsening ROP. However, the review of the one available trial found that increased supplemental oxygen did not reduce the chances of ROP progressing, but may harm the lungs of babies showing signs of worsening ROP.
