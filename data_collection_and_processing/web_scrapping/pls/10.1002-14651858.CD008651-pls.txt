Comparing initial antiretroviral regimens stavudine or zidovudine as part of three‐drug combinations for treatment of HIV infection 
The introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy (ART) as treatment for HIV infection has greatly improved mortality and morbidity for adults and adolescents living with HIV around the world. Deciding which treatment regimen to begin for first‐line treatment in ART‐naïve patients, however, remains a significant challenge. Two of the most commonly used medications include stavudine (d4T) and zidovudine (AZT). The purpose of this review was to assess which of these two medications was the best for initial treatment for people living with HIV, and through our search we identified nine randomised controlled trials. Overall, these studies showed no critical difference between d4T and AZT. Future studies and recommendations should focus on specific toxicities and tolerability when comparing these two medications.
