Family therapy for attention‐deficit disorders in children
This review looks at whether family therapy can help children with attention‐deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) without medication. There are several medications and types of therapy used to treat ADHD. However, many families would rather that their children not take medication. Two studies met the criteria for quality of research method. One found no difference in children's symptoms of ADHD after either family therapy or normal treatment in the community. The second study found that family therapy was more effective than a medication placebo. Further research is needed.
