Treatment for spasticity (muscle tightness and spasm) in people with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis/motor neuron disease 
Spasticity commonly causes a 'stiffness' or 'tightness' in the already weakened muscles of a person with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (also known as motor neuron disease). This can lead to even greater difficulties in the ability to perform day‐to‐day activities. This review found only one randomized trial of treatment for spasticity in motor neuron disease, which involved 25 participants, and no further trials have been found in subsequent updates. There were a number of issues with the design of the study which unfortunately reduced the certainty of the findings. At three months participants performing the 15 minute twice daily exercises had significantly less spasticity overall than control participants (mean reduction of ‐0.43, 95% confidence interval (CI) ‐1.03 to +0.17 in the treatment group versus an increase of +0.25, 95% CI ‐0.46 to +0.96 in control) but the mean change between groups was not significant, as measured by the Ashworth scale (a scale of spasticity, with a range of 0 to 5, where higher is worse). The trial was too small to determine whether individualized moderate intensity endurance type exercises for the trunk and limbs are beneficial or harmful. No side effects from exercise were reported. No other randomized trials of different treatments or therapies were found. Further research is needed to determine if exercise or other therapies such as anti‐spasticity medication are beneficial or harmful.
