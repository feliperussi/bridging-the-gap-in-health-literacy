Prophylactic versus selective use of surfactant in preventing morbidity and mortality in preterm infants 
Surfactant is essential to normal lung function in babies. Surfactant is deficient in the lungs of many babies born prematurely, and is one aspect of lung immaturity leading to a lung disease known a respiratory distress syndrome (RDS). 
Surfactant can be given both to prevent and treat this respiratory problem. Although the initial studies suggested that infants intubated and treated with prophylactic surfactant had improved clinical outcome, more recent studies suggest that stabilization with using continuous "back pressure" (using a device known a continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP)) and surfactant treatment of only those infants who develop breathing problems may be more effective than the more aggressive approach. Prophylactic use of surfactant in babies at high risk of developing RDS does not lead to clinical improvement and may increase the risk of lung injury or death, especially when compared to an approach that incorporates early stabilization on continuous distending pressure.
