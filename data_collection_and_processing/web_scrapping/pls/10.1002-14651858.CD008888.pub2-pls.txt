Inhaled corticosteroids for subacute cough in children
Cough is the most common symptom presenting to doctors. Cough in children negatively impacts on both children and their families, therefore any improvement would be beneficial. Treatment with inhaled corticosteroids may reduce the severity of subacute cough (coughing for two to four weeks) in children by reducing airway inflammation. Data from two small studies were available for inclusion in this review; however, both studies were in infants following hospitalisation for an acute bronchiolitis illness (98 infants in total). There was no difference between groups in the proportion of children 'not cured' at follow‐up. There were no significant side effects in either of these studies. Without further available evidence, recommendations for the use of inhaled corticosteroids for the treatment of subacute cough in children cannot be made. Further well‐designed studies, including children over 12 months of age, are required to determine whether treatment with inhaled corticosteroids can safely and effectively reduce the severity of subacute cough in children.
