Prophylactic oral betamimetics for preventing preterm labour in singleton pregnancies
There are insufficient data on use of betamimetic drugs given by mouth to reduce preterm birth in women at increased risk of preterm labour and carrying one baby. 
Women sometimes go into labour early and babies are born prematurely (before 37 weeks). These babies are at increased risk of health problems and the earlier a baby is born the higher the risk. Babies born before 32 weeks have considerable problems, with those born before 28 weeks being at most risk. These babies can suffer from problems with breathing, bleeding, gut and intestines. They are also at increased risk of cerebral palsy or long‚Äêterm handicap, and some babies do not survive even the early weeks. Babies need special care, sometimes intensive care, and this can be quite traumatic for parents. Preterm birth occurs in around 6% to 10% of births. Many interventions have been assessed to try to improve outcomes for these babies; this review looks at a group of drugs called betamimetics given by mouth in women at increased risk and carrying one baby. These drugs aim to reduce and inhibit labour contractions. However, they do have side effects which include nausea, vomiting, tremor, headaches and shortness of breath. The review of studies found only one trial involving 64 women. There is therefore insufficient evidence to support the use of these drugs to reduce preterm labour and birth.
