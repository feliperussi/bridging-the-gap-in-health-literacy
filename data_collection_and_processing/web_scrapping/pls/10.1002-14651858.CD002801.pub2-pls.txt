Habit retraining for the management of urinary incontinence in adults
Urinary incontinence (inability to control the release of urine) is common in older people, especially those with physical or cognitive impairment. There is a variety of ways of curing or improving incontinence. Habit retraining involves identifying an incontinent person's toileting pattern and developing an individualised toileting schedule to pre‐empt involuntary bladder emptying. It can be labour intensive for the carers. This updated review found that there is not enough evidence from trials on which to judge whether or not there is sufficient improvement in continence to make a habit‐retraining programme worthwhile.
