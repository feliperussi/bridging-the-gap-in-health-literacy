Iloprost and cisaprost for Raynaud's phenomenon in progressive systemic sclerosis
Scleroderma is a connective tissue disease causing fibrosis and commonly affects the skin and internal organs such as the GI tract, lungs, kidney and heart. 
Seven randomized trials and 332 patients were included. Five of the seven trials were of parallel design. Five trials compared I.V. Iloprost and one trial studied p.o. Iloprost and another p.o. Cisaprost. Some trials were dose finding trials so various doses of Iloprost were used. Due to different efficacies of I.V. Iloprost, oral Iloprost and oral Cisaprost, the overall efficacy of these drugs was somewhat diluted. Intravenous Iloprost appears to be effective in the treatment of secondary Raynaud's phenomenon. 
Intravenous Iloprost is effective in the treatment of Raynaud's phenomenon secondary to scleroderma at decreasing the frequency and severity of attacks and preventing or healing digital ulcers. The effect seems to be prolonged after the intravenous infusion is given. Oral Iloprost may have less efficacy than intravenous Iloprost. However, Cisaprost has minimal or no efficacy when given orally for the treatment of Raynaud's phenomenon secondary to scleroderma.
