Surgery or radiosurgery for solitary brain metastases from non‐small cell lung cancer
A solitary brain metastasis is the spread of cancer to the brain some time after successful treatment of the primary cancer. When the metastasis is caused by non‐small cell lung cancer there are two main treatment options: surgery and radiosurgery. Radiosurgery consists of the use of high dose radiotherapy to the affected area guided by a three‐dimensional computer and keeping the patient's head fixed, giving such precise treatment that it is considered "surgical". This review set out to compare both techniques. Our literature search has shown that a well‐designed randomised trial comparing surgery and radiosurgery for patients with solitary brain metastasis has never been performed. Therefore, this review has been unable to show any advantage of one treatment over the other for this group of patients.
