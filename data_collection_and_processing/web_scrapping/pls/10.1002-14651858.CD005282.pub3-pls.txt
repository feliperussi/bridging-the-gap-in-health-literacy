Fish oil for kidney transplant recipients
This review set out to assess any benefit or harm in using fish oil to reduce the risk of kidney damage and heart disease in people who have had a kidney transplant and are receiving standard drugs to prevent rejection. Information from 15 studies was used and showed that fish oils provide a slight improvement in HDL cholesterol and diastolic blood pressure. These studies did not provide enough information on the differences in the risk of death, heart disease, kidney transplant rejection or kidney function between patients receiving fish oils and those receiving placebo. There appeared to be no harmful effects of taking fish oil. The benefits of taking fish oil after a kidney transplant are a mild improvement in some heart disease risk factors. There was not enough information to show any benefit in preventing heart disease or reduction in kidney function. Larger, better studies are needed before regular use of fish oil can be recommended.
