Sumatriptan (rectal route of administration) for acute migraine attacks in adults
Sumatriptan is one of the triptan family of drugs used to treat migraine attacks. It is available as a rectal suppository in some countries, and this route of administration may be preferable for individuals experiencing nausea and/or vomiting. This review found that a single dose administered rectally was effective in relieving migraine headache pain and functional disability. Pain was reduced from moderate or severe to no pain by two hours in approximately 2 in 5 people (41%) taking sumatriptan 25 mg, compared with about 1 in 6 (17%) taking placebo. Pain was reduced from moderate or severe to no worse than mild pain by two hours in roughly 2 in 3 people (71%) taking sumatriptan 25 mg, compared with approximately 1 in 3 (30%) taking placebo. In addition to relieving headache pain, sumatriptan 25 mg also relieved functional disability by two hours in about 2 in 5 people (41%), compared with about 1 in 6 (16%) taking placebo. There was not enough evidence to draw any conclusions about the incidence of adverse events or to compare rectal sumatriptan directly with any other active comparators.
