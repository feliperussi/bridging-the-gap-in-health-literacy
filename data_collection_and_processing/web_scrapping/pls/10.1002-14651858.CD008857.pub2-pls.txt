Dental extractions prior to radiotherapy to the jaws for reducing post‐radiotherapy dental complications 
This review aimed to assess if removing the back teeth before radiotherapy would mean that patients had fewer tooth‐related problems after radiotherapy as part of head and neck cancer treatment, when compared to not removing the teeth. Electronic and handsearching found 357 titles of studies but none of them met the inclusion criteria for the review. There is currently no evidence available to answer this complex question.
