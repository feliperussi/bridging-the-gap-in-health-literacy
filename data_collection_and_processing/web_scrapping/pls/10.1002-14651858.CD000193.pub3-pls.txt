Somatostatin analogues for acute bleeding oesophageal varices
Cirrhosis of the liver is a chronic, progressing disease that is most commonly caused by excessive use of alcohol or by hepatitis C infection. The liver tissue is replaced by connective tissue, which leads to loss of liver function. People with cirrhosis of the liver may develop varicose veins (enlarged blood vessels or varices) in the gullet. Bleeding varices can be life‚Äêthreatening. The hormone somatostatin, or similar drugs like octreotide and vapreotide, can be used to try to stop the bleeding. The review of 21 trials (2588 patients) found that the tested drugs did not reduce deaths. There was a small reduction in the need for blood transfusions, corresponding to one half unit of blood saved per patient. It is doubtful whether this effect is worthwhile.
