Early versus delayed mobilisation to prevent further bleeding after spontaneous bleeding on the surface of the brain 
Aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH) is a serious event where spontaneous bleeding on the surface of the brain is usually caused by the rupture of an abnormal swelling of an artery (aneurysm). If effective treatment is not provided (e.g. surgery or drug therapy) rebleeding may occur, causing death or disability for the patient. Some researchers observed that the highest risk period for rebleeding in people with a SAH was between two and four weeks after symptom onset, if they did not receive effective treatment. Total bedrest for four to six weeks has, therefore, been considered to be one of the basic interventions to avoid rebleeding. However, despite comprehensive searching, we did not identify any suitable studies that provided evidence for or against staying in bed for at least four weeks after symptom onset in people who did not, or could not, have any treatment for their ruptured aneurysm. Treatment strategies to reduce the risk of rebleeding in SAH patients before aneurysm repair, or in those patients not suitable for surgical treatment, or who prefer conservative treatments, deserve further attention.
