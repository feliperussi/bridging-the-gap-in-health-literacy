The effects of anticholinergic drugs in the treatment of bronchiectasis
Bronchiectasis is a chronic respiratory disease. People with the condition experience difficulty in clearing mucus from their lungs, leaving them prone to infections. Atrovent and other anticholinergic agents are bronchodilators which could help with opening up the airways in people with bronchiectasis. We looked for randomised studies addressing this question but we could not identify any evidence for or against the use of anticholinergic drugs in the treatment of bronchiectasis.
