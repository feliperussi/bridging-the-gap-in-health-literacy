Tumor necrosis factor‐alpha antibody for induction of remission in Crohn's disease
Although corticosteroids are effective for treating Crohn's disease, approximately 20% of patients who respond become sick again when steroids are withdrawn and become steroid dependent. Furthermore, corticosteroids exhibit significant adverse effects. TNF alpha is a chemical that causes some of the inflammation of Crohn's disease. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) alpha blocking drugs may provide an alternate treatment for patients who do not respond to corticosteroid or immunosuppressive drug treatment. This review shows that a single intravenous infusion of infliximab (5 mg/kg) may be an effective treatment for patients with active Crohn's disease who no longer respond to corticosteroids or immunosuppressive drugs. There is also some evidence that CDP571, another TNF alpha blocking drug may be effective. There is no evidence to support the use of etanercept, a drug that blocks the action of TNF alpha by binding to receptors. There were no serious side effects associated with TNF blocking drugs, although the follow‐up period of the studies reported in this review may have been too short to assess the development of serious side effects.
