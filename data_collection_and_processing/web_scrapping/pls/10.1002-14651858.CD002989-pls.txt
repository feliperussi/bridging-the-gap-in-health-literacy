Pet allergen control measures for allergic asthma in children and adults
Some people with asthma who own pets can be allergic to the dander that accumulates in and around the home. Certain guidelines recommend the removal of pets as the most effective way of reducing exposure to the allergens emanating from their hair and skin. Other measures have been proposed as an alternative to pet removal, such as pet washing, sprays and air filtration units. The aim of these interventions is to lower the amount of allergen in the air and on the floor of the home, and so limit the risk of asthma symptoms worsening. Very little research of a high quality has been published on this topic, and the current evidence is not sufficiently reliable to draw firm conclusions. Further research should consider the effectiveness of pet washing, sprays and possibly pet removal from the home.
