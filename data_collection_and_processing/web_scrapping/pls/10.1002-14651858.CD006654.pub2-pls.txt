Olanzapine versus other atypical antipsychotics for schizophrenia
This review examined the effects of olanzapine compared to other second generation antipsychotic drugs for schizophrenia. We identified 50 relevant studies with 9476 participants, comparing olanzapine with amisulpride, aripiprazole, clozapine, quetiapine, risperidone and ziprasidone. Comparisons of olanzapine with the second generation antipsychotic drugs sertindole or zotepine are currently not available. Olanzapine was somewhat more efficacious than aripiprazole, quetiapine, risperidone and ziprasidone, whereas there was no efficacy difference compared to amisulpride and clozapine. The main disadvantage of olanzapine was its higher weight gain and associated metabolic problems compared to all other second generation antipsychotic drugs, except for clozapine.
