Treatment for neuralgic amyotrophy
Neuralgic amyotrophy is a painful disorder of the peripheral nervous system that occurs in episodes. It affects the arms and shoulders, and leads to muscle wasting and weakness. There has been anecdotal evidence that corticosteroids can have a favourable effect on pain and recovery. No randomised clinical trial could be found in either the original 2009 review or when searches were updated in 2011 to validate the effects of this type of treatment, or any treatment. One randomised controlled trial comparing prednisolone to placebo is currently awaiting formal reporting.
