Dopamine versus no treatment to prevent renal dysfunction in indomethacin‐treated preterm newborn infants 
Dopamine has not been shown to prevent adverse effects of indomethacin on the kidneys of preterm babies. Indomethacin is a drug used in preterm babies to prevent brain hemorrhage or to help close off PDA (patent ductus arteriosus ‐ when a channel between the lungs and heart does not close off after birth as it should). Indomethacin often causes fluid retention and reduced flow of urine, which can sometimes cause deterioration in kidney (renal) function. The drug dopamine is sometimes used along with indomethacin to try and prevent negative impact on the kidneys. The review found there is not enough evidence from trials to show there is any value in giving dopamine to babies being treated with indomethacin.
