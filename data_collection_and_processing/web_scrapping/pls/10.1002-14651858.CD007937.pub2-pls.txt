Using oxygen at high pressure (in a compression chamber) for the treatment of individuals with severe soft tissue infection (necrotizing fasciitis) 
Severe soft tissue infection (necrotizing fasciitis) is life threatening, is associated with prolonged hospital stay and carries high risk of long‐term loss of function. Routine treatment consists of immediate surgical removal of infected tissue and administration of antibiotics. Use of hyperbaric oxygen therapy, or HBOT, in addition to surgery and antibiotics has been suggested as a way to minimize tissue loss, decrease the number of limb amputations and reduce death. The aim of HBOT is to increase the supply of oxygen to the site. This approach may be toxic to bacteria, may improve the effectiveness of antibiotics and can improve healing. 
We searched the databases to September 2014. This Cochrane review found no high‐quality trials to support or refute the use of HBOT in the treatment of individuals with necrotizing fasciitis. It should be noted that HBOT may very rarely result in serious adverse effects. Further studies are required to address the effectiveness of HBOT because currently it is provided as routine practice in some centres.
