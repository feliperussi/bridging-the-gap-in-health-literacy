Conventional surgical hemorrhoidectomy results in fewer recurrences than stapled hemorrhoidopexy.
Hemorrhoids are one of the most common anorectal disorders. The Milligan‐Morgan open hemorrhoidectomy is the most widely practiced surgical technique used for the management of hemorrhoids and is considered the current "gold standard". Circular stapled hemorrhoidopexy was first described in 1998 as alternative to conventional excisional hemorrhoidectomy.  A review of randomized control trials comparing stapled hemorrhoidopexy and conventional excisional surgery was conducted. The results show that the stapled technique is associated with a higher risk of recurrent hemorrhoids and some symptoms in long term follow‐up. Patients should be informed of these risks when being offered the stapled homorrhoidopexy as surgical therapy.
