Providing locomotor training to people with spinal cord injury to improve walking ability 
A traumatic spinal cord injury (SCI) is a lesion of neural elements of the spinal cord that can result in any degree of sensory and motor deficit, autonomic or bowel dysfunction. Locomotor training for walking is used in rehabilitation after spinal cord injury (SCI) and might help to improve a person's ability to walk. However, many strategies exist to improve this function, such as treadmill training with and without bodyweight support, robotic‐assisted gait training and electrical stimulation. 
Five randomised controlled trials were identified involving 309 people with spinal cord injury. None of the locomotor interventions had a beneficial or harmful effect on the people taking part. In all five studies there were no differences in adverse events or drop‐outs between study groups. There is not enough evidence to conclude which locomotor training strategy is most effective in improving walking ability in people with spinal cord injury, or that locomotor training benefits a person's ability to walk over other kinds of rehabilitation.
