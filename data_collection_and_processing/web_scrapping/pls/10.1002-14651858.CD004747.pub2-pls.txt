Rivastigmine appears to moderately improve cognition and to a lesser extent activities of daily living in patients with PDD 
Dementia is frequently associated with Parkinson's Disease. While a number of neurotransmitters appear to be involved, loss of cholinergic functioning is particularly associated with Parkinson's Disease Dementia (PDD) suggesting a potential utility for cholinesterase inhibitors. Rivastigmine appears to moderately improve cognition and to a lesser extent activities of daily living in patients with PDD. There was a clinically meaningful benefit in 15% of patients. Efficacy in other domains requires confirmation. Tolerability in particular nausea, vomiting and tremor appear problematic.
