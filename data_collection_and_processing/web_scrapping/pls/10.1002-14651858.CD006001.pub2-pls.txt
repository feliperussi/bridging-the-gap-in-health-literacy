No evidence to support or refute endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreaticography (ERCP) with stenting in patients with malignant pancreaticobiliary diseases, awaiting surgery 
Pancreatico‐biliary malignancy includes cancers of pancreas, ampulla, duodenum, and cholangiocarcinoma. There is significant morbidity and mortality related to surgery in these patients. Studies have claimed the beneficial role of biliary decompression, which can be performed via endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreaticography (ERCP) with stent insertion pre‐surgically. The review found that pre‐surgical biliary stenting via ERCP did not improve the morbidity and mortality in patients with pancreatico‐biliary malignancy. Further evidence about its efficiency is needed.
