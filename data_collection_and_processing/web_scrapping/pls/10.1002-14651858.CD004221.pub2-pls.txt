Buccal or sublingual misoprostol for cervical ripening and induction of labour
Not enough evidence to say if misoprostol administered under the tongue or in the cheek is safe for induction of labour. 
Sometimes labour is started artificially (induction) because of concerns for the well‚Äêbeing of either the baby or the mother. A drug called misoprostol has previously been used either by being put in the mother's vagina or by being swallowed. It is now suggested that placing it under the tongue or in the cheek may be more effective. There were not enough studies to say whether there might be important adverse effects. More research has been called for.
