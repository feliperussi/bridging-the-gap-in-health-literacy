Adjuvant chemotherapy for small intestine adenocarcinoma
Adenocarcinoma of the small intestine is an infrequently encountered tumour and, as such, knowledge of its clinical and pathological characteristics is limited. No suitable evidence was found to determine the role of adjuvant chemotherapy, when compared with placebo or any other or no adjuvant treatment, in the management of adenocarcinoma of the small intestine.  More research is needed.
