Interleukin 10 (IL‚Äê10) for induction of remission in Crohn's disease
Crohn's disease is an inflammatory condition of unknown origin that can affect any portion of the gastrointestinal tract from the mouth to the anus. However, it most commonly involves the distal small bowel and/or the colon. Interleukin 10 does not appear to provide any benefit for the treatment of active Crohn's disease. This systematic review showed that this drug does not increase the number of remissions but increases the number of patients that withdrew from the included studies due to side effects. The methodological quality of the included studies was high. Further studies of this agent for the treatment of active Crohn's disease are unlikely to be undertaken.
