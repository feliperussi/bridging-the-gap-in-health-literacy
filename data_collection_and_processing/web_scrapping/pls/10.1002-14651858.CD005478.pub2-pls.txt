Naftidrofuryl for acute stroke
Stroke is the third most common cause of death and the commonest cause of disability in the western world. Stroke greatly adds to the burden on patients, carers, medical practitioners and health resources. The development of drugs to limit brain damage caused by stroke continues but no routine effective treatment has yet been identified. In previous years, naftidrofuryl has been considered as a potential treatment for acute stroke, but has been withdrawn from the market in the UK. This systematic review of six trials, involving 1274 participants, found there was not enough data to draw conclusions about the effectiveness of naftidrofuryl relating to survival or disability in the treatment of acute stroke.
