Anticholinergic drugs versus either placebo or other medications for children over two years of age with asthma 
Anticholinergic drugs are widely used in the management of both acute and chronic asthma in children. Their effect is achieved through relief of narrowing of the airways that occurs in asthma. Current guidelines for the management of chronic asthma advise that anticholinergic drugs may be used if children are already on high dose inhaled steroids. This study undertook a comprehensive search of the literature unrestricted by country of publication or language. Unfortunately small numbers of relevant trials were found and these were of variable quality. This review found that although anticholinergic drugs are well tolerated, in children over two years of age, there is not enough data to be sure if they are better than placebo in terms of effects on lung function or symptoms.
