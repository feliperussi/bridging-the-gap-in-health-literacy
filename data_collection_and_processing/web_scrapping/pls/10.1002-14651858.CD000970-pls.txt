There is insufficient evidence to compare equivalence of effect between fully intermittent and daily treatment in adult patients with pulmonary tuberculosis. 
Rifampicin‚Äêcontaining drug combinations can achieve high cure rates in patients with pulmonary tuberculosis when given for six months. Such treatment can be given either daily or intermittently (eg three times a week) from the beginning. This review compared the equivalence of effect between such treatments but did not find enough evidence to be able to assess this.
