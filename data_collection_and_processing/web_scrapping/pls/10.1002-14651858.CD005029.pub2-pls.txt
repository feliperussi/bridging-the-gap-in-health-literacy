The use of different treatment for incoordination of limb movement (ataxia) or tremor in people with multiple sclerosis 
MS is a chronic disease of the central nervous system which typically affects both young and middle aged adults. It can result in many different symptoms including ataxia. 
In order to help these symptoms, several different treatments, such as physiotherapy, neurosurgery, and oral medications containing cannabis extract, isoniazid or baclofen have been used. The authors conducted a search of the medical literature and found that only 10 out of 59 studies met the criteria of minimum methodological quality necessary for inclusion in this review. These studies represented a total of 172 MS patients with ataxia. This review has found that there is not enough evidence to suggest that any treatment (drugs, physiotherapy or neurosurgery) provides sustained improvement in ataxia or tremor. More research is required.
