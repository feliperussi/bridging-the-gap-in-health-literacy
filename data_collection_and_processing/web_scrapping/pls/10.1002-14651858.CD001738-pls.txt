Antibiotics for reducing the rate of infection after bites by mammals such as humans
Bite wounds may become infected due to the transfer of bacteria from the mouth of mammals into the skin. There was a decrease in the risk of developing an infection after a human bite when given antibiotics. Antibiotics also decreased the chance of developing a wound infection after a bite on the hand. Further studies are required to confirm these findings.
