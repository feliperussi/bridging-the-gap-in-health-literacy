Debridement for surgical wounds
Following surgery most surgical wounds heal naturally with no complications. However, complications such as infection and wound dehiscence (opening) can occur which may result in delayed healing or wound breakdown. Infected surgical wounds may contain dead (devitalised) tissue. Removal of this dead tissue (debridement) from surgical wounds is believed to enable wound healing. Many methods are available to clinicians to debride surgical wounds. This review showed that there is insufficient valid research evidence to recommend any one particular method. 
There is a clear need for more research into which method is most effective in removing dead tissue from surgical wounds that have become infected.
