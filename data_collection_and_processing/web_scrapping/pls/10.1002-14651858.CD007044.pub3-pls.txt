Extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL) versus percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL) or retrograde intrarenal surgery (RIRS) for kidney stones 
Stones in the urinary tract are a common medical problem. Half of patients with previous urinary stones have a recurrence within 10 years. Kidney stones can cause pain, blood in the urine, infection, decreased kidney function, and kidney failure. The treatment is to remove the stones from kidney. Extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL) disintegrates stones using shock waves and is a minimally invasive technique. Other minimally invasive methods (percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL)) and retrograde intrarenal surgery (RIRS)) are widely used for kidney stones management because ESWL had limited success rate. This review aimed to compare the effectiveness and complications between ESWL and stones removing using the nephroscopy through the skin at kidney level (PCNL) or ureteroscope through the bladder and ureter to the kidney (RIRS). Five small randomised studies (338 patients) were included. Four studies compared ESWL with PCNL and one study compared ESWL with RIRS. Patients with kidney stones who undergo PCNL have a higher success rate than ESWL whereas RIRS was not significantly different from ESWL. However, ESWL patients spent less time in hospital, duration of treatment was shorter and there were fewer complications.
