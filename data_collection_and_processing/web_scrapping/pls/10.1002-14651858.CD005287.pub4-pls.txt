Selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) for uterine leiomyomas
Selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) are a novel synthetic estrogen receptor (ER) ligand, which may be useful for women with uterine fibroids. Three randomised clinical trials evaluating the beneficial and harmful effects of SERMs are included in this review. However, due to the small number of participants in the included studies, inconsistency in findings, and the poor quality of the evidence, the authors were not able to recommend their use or non‚Äêuse in women with uterine fibroids. No new studies were identified in the updated seach and there are no new findings for this updated review.
