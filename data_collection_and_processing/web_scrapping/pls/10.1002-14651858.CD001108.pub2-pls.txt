Antifungal drugs (azoles) for allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis associated with asthma 
Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis is a condition that complicates some people with chronic asthma. Standard treatment for this condition is high doses of oral steroids. The azole antifungal drugs attack the fungus that causes this condition and short term studies suggest that they may have some benefit when added to standard therapy.
