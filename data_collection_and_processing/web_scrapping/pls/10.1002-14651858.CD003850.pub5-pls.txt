Prophylactic systemic antifungal agents to prevent mortality and morbidity in very low birth weight infants 
Review question: In very low birth weight infants, does the use of prophylactic systemic antifungal therapy decrease the risk of mortality and morbidity? 
Background: Fungi such as candida (the organism that causes thrush) can cause severe infections in very low birth weight infants (birth weight less than 1.5 kg). These infections are often difficult to diagnose. It may be appropriate to attempt to prevent such infections by giving all very low birth weight infants antifungal drugs as a routine part of their care (systemic antifungal prophylaxis). This review assessed whether evidence exists that such a practice prevents severe fungal infection, death, and disability in very low birth weight infants. 
Study characteristics: We identified 15 eligible trials enrolling a total of 1690 infants. These trials were generally of good quality. 
Key findings: The overall analysis showed a reduction in the risk of severe fungal infection in infants who received systemic antifungal prophylaxis but did not show a difference in the risk of death. The trials did not assess the risk of long‐term problems, including disabilities. 
Conclusions: There is evidence from some good‐quality trials that giving infants an antifungal drug regularly for the first four to six weeks after birth reduces the number of infants who develop severe infection. There is not yet any convincing evidence that death or disability rates are affected.
