Parasympathomimetic drugs for the treatment of 'dry mouth' due to radiotherapy
This updated review found there is limited evidence to support the use of pilocarpine hydrochloride in the treatment of radiation‐induced salivary gland dysfunction ('dry mouth'). Salivary gland damage is a frequent and important complication of radiotherapy to the head and neck area; it causes dryness of the mouth with resultant problems with eating, talking, and local infection. The parasympathomimetic group of drugs have been used to treat radiotherapy‐induced salivary gland damage. 
We identified three studies that involved a total of 289 participants, and they all used the drug pilocarpine. 
The review found that 42% to 51% of participants (4 to 5 in 10) responded to pilocarpine, although in some participants the response did not occur for up to 12 weeks. Pilocarpine was more effective than a placebo treatment, and at least as effective as an artificial saliva. 
Side effects were common with pilocarpine (for example sweating, headache, passing urine frequently, flushing), but were usually reported to be mild; 6% to 15% (0.6 to 1.5 in 10) participants had to stop taking pilocarpine due to side effects. 
The findings of this review are limited by the small number of good‐quality trials that have been performed in this area. The update of this review did not find any new information on this topic.
