Melatonin treatment may be effective for the treatment of dementia‐related behavior disturbances 
There are a number of studies that suggest a relationship between decline of melatonin function and the symptoms of dementia. Meta‐analysis was conducted on data from three randomised, placebo controlled trials that were designed to evaluate melatonin for managing dementia‐related cognitive changes; data also were pooled from two of these trials that evaluated melatonin for managing mood and behavioral disturbances. Significantly improved outcomes were found from the meta‐analysis of psychopathologic behavior and mood scale scores. Melatonin treatment may be effective for the treatment of dementia‐related psychopathologic behavior disturbances. No evidence was found to support the effectiveness of melatonin for the treatment of cognitive impairment.
