Intrauterine insemination versus fallopian tube sperm perfusion for non‐tubal infertility
Review question: This review compared intrauterine insemination versus fallopian tube sperm perfusion in the treatment of non‐tubal subfertility, for live birth and pregnancy outcomes. 
Background: Intrauterine insemination (IUI) is an assisted reproduction procedure that places sperm directly into the uterus. Fallopian tube sperm perfusion (FSP) is a similar procedure that places sperm into the woman's fallopian tube, closer to the eggs than IUI. Both techniques aim to improve the chance of conception. 
Study characteristics: The review included 16 randomised controlled trials (more than 1800 women) that compared these procedures for treating couples with non‐tubal subfertility. Only three trials reported live birth. The evidence is current to September 2013. No trial reported its funding source, but one reported no conflict of interest, and one stated that it had received no commercial funding. 
Key results: No clear evidence suggests any difference between IUI and FSP with respect to their effectiveness and safety in the treatment of couples with non‐tubal subfertility. However, a high level of uncertainty due to lack of data is evident in the findings. 
Quality of the evidence: The overall quality of the evidence was rated as low for most outcomes, largely because of the small quantity of available data.
