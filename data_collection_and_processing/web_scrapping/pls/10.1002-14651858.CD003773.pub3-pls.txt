Intermittent versus continuous renal replacement therapy for acute renal failure in adults 
Acute renal failure (ARF) is an abrupt reduction in kidney function with elevation of blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and plasma creatinine and a fall in urine output. In most cases correction of the underlying cause leads to recovery, however for many some form of renal replacement therapy (RRT ‐ a treatment that removes waste products, salts and excess water form the body) may be required. RRT can either be intermittent (IRRT‐ performed for less than 24 hours in each 24 hour period, two to seven times per week) or continuous (CRRT‐ performed continuously without any interruption throughout each day). It has been suggested that CRRT has several advantages over IRRT including better haemodynamic stability (blood pressure control and blood circulation), improved survival and greater likelihood of renal recovery. Our systematic review identified 15 randomised studies with 1550 patients comparing CRRT with IRRT. We did not find any difference between CRRT and IRRT with respect to mortality, renal recovery, and risk of haemodynamic instability or hypotension episodes.
