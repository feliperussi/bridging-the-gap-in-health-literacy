Interventions for the management of dry mouth: topical therapies
Dry mouth is a common problem with a range of causes. The symptom may be due to a reduction in the quantity of saliva produced, or a change in the composition of saliva, but a feeling of dry mouth may also be present in people with normal saliva production. Radiotherapy or chemotherapy for head and neck cancers, and diseases such as Sjögren's Syndrome, may result in reduced saliva production. Many commonly prescribed medications are associated with a feeling of dry mouth, despite normal saliva production. As well as difficulty in speaking, chewing and swallowing, prolonged dry mouth may result in increased risk of tooth decay and reduced quality of life. In many sufferers dry mouth cannot be cured, but effective ways for people to manage dry mouth symptoms are available. Many topical treatments (applied directly to the inside of the mouth) such as sprays, lozenges, mouthrinses, gels, oils, chewing gum or toothpastes have been evaluated in this review, but there is no strong evidence that any topical treatment is effective for relieving the sensation of dry mouth. Oxygenated glycerol triester (OGT) saliva substitute spray is more effective than a water based electrolyte spray. A gel‐releasing device worn in the mouth, or a mouthcare system might be effective but more research is needed. Chewing gum increases saliva production but there is no evidence that gum is better or worse than saliva substitutes. Acidic products and those containing sugar should be avoided.
