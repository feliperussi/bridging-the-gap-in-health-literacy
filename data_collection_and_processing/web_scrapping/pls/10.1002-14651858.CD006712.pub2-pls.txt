Pain control in first trimester surgical abortion.
Multiple methods of pain control in first trimester surgical abortion at less than 14 weeks gestational age using electric or manual suction aspiration are available, and appear both safe and effective. Pain control methods can be divided in local anesthesia, conscious sedation, general anesthesia and non‚Äêpharmacological methods. Data to support the benefit of the widely used local aneathetic is inadequate. While general anesthesia achieved complete pain control during the procedure, other forms of anesthesia such as conscious sedation with a paracervical block improved postoperative pain control.
