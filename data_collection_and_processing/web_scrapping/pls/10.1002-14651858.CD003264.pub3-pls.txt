There is some evidence that human growth hormone may help reduce growth problems in children with chronic kidney disease 
The kidneys filter blood. Children with chronic kidney disease (CKD) may progress to end‚Äêstage kidney failure and need their blood filtered by machine (dialysis) or they need a kidney transplant. CKD can stunt growth in children. Growth hormone (rhGH) has been used to help children grow to a more average height for their age but rhGH may have adverse effects including added risk of transplant rejection and high pressure in the brain. This review of 16 studies enrolling 809 children found that rhGH increased height in children with CKD by about 4 cm after 1 year and by a further 2 cm after 2 years of treatment compared with no treatment. The frequency of reported side effects of rhGH was generally similar to that of the control group.
