How can adults with bronchiectasis be encouraged to take treatments as prescribed by their health professional? 
Review question How can adults with bronchiectasis be encouraged to complete treatments such as medications, breathing exercises or other exercise as prescribed by their health professional? 
Background 
Bronchiectasis is caused by a widening of the airways. People with bronchiectasis have too much mucus in their lungs and often suffer from chest infections. Bronchiectasis occurs more commonly in women, and those in middle age. Treatments prescribed for bronchiectasis include inhalers, nebulisers and airway clearance physiotherapy. Doing all of these correctly can take up a lot of time every day. Many people with bronchiectasis find it difficult to fit these treatments into their daily lives. 
Taking treatments in the way they have been prescribed by a health professional is called adherence. People with bronchiectasis who have low adherence to treatments like nebulised antibiotics have more chest infections than those with high adherence. We wanted to find out ways of encouraging adults with bronchiectasis to take treatments as prescribed by their health professional. 
Search date 
The evidence is current to October 2015.
Key results 
We identified 37 reports but did not find any studies that tested ways to improve adherence to treatment. Properly‚Äêdesigned research studies that include an appropriate number of people with bronchiectasis are needed to answer this question.
