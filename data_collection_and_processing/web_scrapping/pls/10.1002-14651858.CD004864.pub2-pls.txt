Sodium bicarbonate infusion during resuscitation of infants at birth
Intravenous infusion of sodium bicarbonate to newborn babies during resuscitation in the delivery room at birth. At birth some babies who do not start breathing spontaneously have an abnormal amount of acid in their blood. To treat this, an alkaline drug, sodium bicarbonate, has often been given intravenously. Although this has been common practice for over thirty years, there is no good evidence that this is beneficial and may cause harm. We found only one high quality study of 55 babies that compared sodium bicarbonate treatment with no treatment. The study did not show any benefit of the use of this drug immediately after birth, nor any adverse effects.
