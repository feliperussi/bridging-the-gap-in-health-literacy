Omega 3 fatty acids for maintenance of remission in ulcerative colitis
Fish oil contains omega 3 fatty acids that may be beneficial in reducing inflammation, such as seen in the bowel of ulcerative colitis patients. Randomized placebo‐controlled studies that evaluated the effect of daily intake of omega‐3 fatty acids to maintain remission in ulcerative colitis were reviewed. Three studies were included of which none reported a reduction in the rate of disease relapse in comparison with placebo. When the studies were pooled for meta‐analysis there was no benefit for omega 3 fatty acids. There were no serious side effects in any of the studies. None of the studies used enteric coated capsules which allow release of the fish oil in the small bowel. Non‐enteric coated omega‐3 fatty acids (fish oil) seem safe but ineffective for maintaining remission in ulcerative colitis. Further studies of enteric coated capsules may be justified.
