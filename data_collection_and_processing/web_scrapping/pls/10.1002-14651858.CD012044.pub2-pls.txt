Physical activity for lower urinary tract symptoms due to benign prostatic obstruction
Review question 
What are the effects of physical activity on lower urinary tract symptoms in men with an enlarged prostate? 
Background 
As men grow older, many develop bothersome urinary problems, such as a weak stream and frequent urination during the day or nightime. A common reason for these symptoms is enlargement of the prostate. Treatment for this problem includes lifestyle changes (like drinking less fluid), medications, and surgical procedures. Physical activity, defined as movement produced by muscles, may also improve these symptoms. We conducted this review to compare how physical activity compares to other methods, in treating such urinary tract symptoms. 
Study characteristics 
We included six studies, comprising 652 men altogether, that studied four different comparisons. The studies compared different forms of physical activity, alone or as part of a self‐management programme, to watchful waiting (no specific intervention) or to alpha‐blocker treatment. 
Based on very low‐quality evidence for the outcomes of symptom score for lower urinary tract symptoms, and stopping the treatment because of unwanted effects, we are uncertain whether physical activity interventions are helpful in men with lower urinary tract symptoms due to benign prostatic obstruction. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the evidence was very low, which means that the true effect may be substantially different from the findings of the review. Further research is very likely to change the results.
