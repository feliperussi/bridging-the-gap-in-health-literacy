Oestrogen supplementation, mainly diethylstilbestrol, for preventing miscarriages and other adverse pregnancy outcomes 
Diethylstilbestrol during pregnancy poses serious long‚Äêterm risks for those exposed in the womb and offers no known benefit for mothers and children. 
Diethylstilbestrol (DES), an oestrogen, was for decades widely believed to prevent miscarriage and other undesirable outcomes despite a lack of good evidence. A cluster of women with a rare form of vaginal cancer led researchers to associate this, and other adverse outcomes in adults, with their exposure to DES in the womb. This review of trials showed that DES increased the risk of miscarriage, of babies being born too early, and other serious adverse effects in women and men who were exposed in the womb. Results are a warning to avoid this drug in pregnancy.
