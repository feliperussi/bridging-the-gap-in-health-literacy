Naftopidil for the treatment of lower urinary tract symptoms compatible with benign prostatic hyperplasia 
Review question 
What are the effects of naftopidil in men with bothersome urinary symptoms due to an enlarged prostate? 
Background 
An enlarged prostate (called benign prostatic hyperplasia) can cause bothersome lower urinary tract symptoms such as having to urinate often during the day or at night, having a weak urine stream, and having the feeling of not emptying the bladder completely. A common reason for these complaints is an enlarged prostate, which is common in older men. Naftopidil is a medication that may help with these symptoms and possibly cause fewer unwanted effects than other medications used for this problem. In this review, we compared naftopidil to other medicines. 
Study characteristics 
We included 22 studies with 2223 men. The average age was 68.0 years. These men had mostly symptoms rated as moderate or severe. 
Key results 
Naftopidil may have had similar effects on urinary symptoms and QoL compared to tamsulosin and silodosin. In terms of unwanted effects, naftopidil may have had similar unwanted sexual side effects compared to tamsulosin but have fewer compared to silodosin. 
Reliability of the evidence 
The reliability of evidence for most symptoms was low. This means that the true effect may be substantially different from what this review shows.
