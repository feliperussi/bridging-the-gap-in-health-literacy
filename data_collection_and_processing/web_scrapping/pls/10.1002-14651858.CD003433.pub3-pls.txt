Beta radiation in glaucoma surgery
The aim of glaucoma surgery is to lower the pressure in the eye. The outcome of glaucoma surgery can be affected by the rate at which the surgical wound heals. Beta radiation has been proposed as a rapid and simple treatment to slow down the healing response. It is applied during the operation using a radioactive applicator which emits beta rays which have only a very local penetration to a depth of less than one millimetre. The intensity of the emission from the applicator (usually Strontium‚Äê90) determines the duration it is applied to the surgical site in order to deliver the required dose of radiation which effectively prevents scar tissue formation. 
We found four trials that randomised 551 people to trabeculectomy with beta irradiation versus trabeculectomy alone. People who had trabeculectomy with beta irradiation were less likely to have an eye pressure that was too high one year after surgery compared to people who had trabeculectomy alone. However, people who had beta irradiation had an increased risk of cataract after surgery.
