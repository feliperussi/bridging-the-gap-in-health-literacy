Optimal monitoring strategies for guiding when to switch first‐line antiretroviral therapy regimens for treatment failure among adults and adolescents living with HIV in low‐resource settings 
To provide the best possible care to patients with AIDS, it is important to decide correctly when to switch from one antiretroviral therapy to another for patients experiencing treatment failure. In low‐resource settings, it appears that monitoring strategies which use immunologic or immunologic and virologic monitoring in addition to clinical monitoring for guiding when to switch therapy results in fewer patient deaths, fewer AIDS‐defining illnesses, and fewer unnecessary switches. There is little evidence that adding virologic monitoring to immunologic monitoring has benefits. Further information on the studies, which are mostly currently reported in partial form, will give insight into this topic. Additionally, ongoing studies addressing when to switch likely will provide information to further clarify optimal monitoring strategies for guiding when to switch first‐line therapy. Finally, cost‐analysis studies will lend further insights into the relevance of these findings to low‐resource settings.
