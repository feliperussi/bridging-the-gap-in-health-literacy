Soft versus firm catheters for intrauterine insemination
Intrauterine insemination (IUI) is a recommended treatment for women with unexplained subfertility. In an IUI cycle, sperm are processed in the laboratory and placed directly in the womb at the time of ovulation with a catheter. Recent research suggested that the type of catheter used in in vitro fertilisation (IVF) may have had an influence on the pregnancy outcomes, but the effect of catheters on IUI had been poorly investigated. We reviewed studies that compared different catheters in IUI procedures, but the effect of catheter choice on the pregnancy outcomes still remains unknown.
