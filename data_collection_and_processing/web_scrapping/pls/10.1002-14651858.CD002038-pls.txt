When used with AZT, ddI and perhaps ddC, can delay HIV disease progression and death
Zidovudine (AZT) was the first antiretroviral drug used in HIV and AIDS. It is expensive and has several adverse effects including nausea, vomiting, blood problems (anaemia and neutropenia) and myopathy (muscle weakness). The next two drugs developed for HIV were didanosine (ddI) and zalcitabine (ddC). The adverse effects of ddI include nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea and problems with the pancreas (pancreatitis) and nerves in the arms and legs (peripheral neuropathy). Adverse effects of ddC are mouth ulcers and peripheral neuropathy. The review of trials found that both HIV disease progression and death are delayed by ddI, and perhaps also by ddC, at least when used with AZT.
