Oral zinc for the prevention of hyperbilirubinaemia in neonates
Review question 
In newborn infants less than one week old, does oral zinc salt supplementation compared to placebo or no treatment decrease the incidence of hyperbilirubinaemia (jaundice)? 
Background 
Jaundice, or yellowish discolouration of the skin, can occur due to an increased amount of bilirubin pigment in the blood. It is a commonly observed and usually harmless condition in newborn infants during the first week after birth. However, in some babies, the amount of bilirubin pigment can increase to dangerous levels and necessitate treatment. Bilirubin is metabolised in the liver and is excreted via the intestine in faeces. Increased reabsorption of bilirubin from the intestine is one of the major factors inducing hyperbilirubinaemia in newborn infants. Oral zinc salt, a relatively harmless medicine, can reduce the bilirubin level in newborn infants by decreasing its reabsorption from the intestine. 
Study characteristics 
Researchers from Cochrane searched for all available literature up to 30 November 2014. One randomised controlled trial met our inclusion criteria. 
Results 
In this review, the efficacy of oral zinc salt was compared with placebo. One study enrolling 294 infants was identified. This study evaluated oral zinc salt, given in a dose of 5 mg twice daily to infants between 25 and 168 hours old. The administration of oral zinc salt did not affect the incidence of jaundice (hyperbilirubinaemia) in these infants.
