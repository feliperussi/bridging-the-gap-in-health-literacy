Time effects of blood pressure lowering drugs for the treatment of high blood pressure
Elevated blood pressure is an important public health problem and once daily dosing regimen with blood pressure lowering drugs are recommended to reduce risk of strokes and heart attacks. This review examined the administration‐time‐related effects of once‐daily evening versus morning regimen on death, cardiovascular outcomes and blood pressure reduction. The interventions included chronotherapeutic delivery formulations and conventional antihypertensive agents. 21 trials, involving 1,993 patients with primary hypertension were identified. We concluded that evening dosing with antihypertensive drugs had a slightly better blood pressure control than the morning dosing regimen in 24‐hour BP, but its effect on death and adverse cardiovascular outcomes is not known.
