Specialist teams for neonatal transport to neonatal intensive care units for prevention of morbidity and mortality 
Review question: Do specialist transport teams compared with non‐specialist transport teams improve clinical outcome for newborn infants in need of transport to neonatal intensive care? 
Background: High‐risk newborn infants tend to have better outcomes if born in a centre with a Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU). Although it is advocated that women with high risk factors be transferred to centres with NICU facilities for delivery, at times it is inevitable that birth occurs at centres that are unable to treat their newborns. Therefore, the need for specially trained neonatal transport health personnel is important to ensure that these infants are stabilised and transported to hospitals with an NICU. This review was conducted to find out whether specially trained neonatal transport teams, compared with general transport teams, had better clinical outcomes. 
Study characteristics: No eligible trials were identified for inclusion in this review. 
Key results: There is no evidence from randomised controlled trials to support or refute that specialist teams for neonatal transport reduce mortality and morbidity among newborn infants requiring retrieval to an NICU. It may be necessary to rely on evidence from cluster trials (where groups of hospitals are compared) or good quality non‐randomised study designs to provide answers to this question.
