Psychological treatments for depression in young adults and adults born with heart problems 
Sometimes young adults and adults who are born with heart problems grow up and have depression. Treatments to help them other than anti‐depressant drugs include psychotherapy, cognitive behavioural therapies and talking therapies. Benefits of having treatment may include improved quality of life, and disadvantages of having treatment may include more severe depression and lower quality of life. Our objective was to update the previous review on the effects (both harms and benefits) of psychological interventions for treating depression in young adults and adults with congenital heart disease. Psychological interventions include cognitive behavioural therapy, psychotherapy, or 'talking/counselling' therapy for depression. We updated the previous searches up to February 2013 and found no evidence from randomised controlled trials about the effects of psychotherapy, cognitive behavioural therapies and talking therapies for treating depression in adults or young adults born with heart disease. A well‐designed randomised controlled trial is needed to assess the effects of psychological interventions for depression in congenital heart disease.
