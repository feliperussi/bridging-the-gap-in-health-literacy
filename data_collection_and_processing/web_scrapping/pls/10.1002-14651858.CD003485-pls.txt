Steroid therapy for meconium aspiration syndrome in newborn infants
More research needed to show whether corticosteroids could reduce complications and mortality in newborn babies with meconium aspiration syndrome. 
A bowel movement (meconium) from an unborn baby in stress during labour can enter the lungs when the baby starts to breathe after birth. Suction and/or intubation are used to try and remove the meconium from the baby's breathing passages, but some babies will still develop meconium aspiration syndrome. Those babies will have breathing difficulties which can lead to breathing failure and death. Corticosteroids are anti‚Äêinflammatory drugs that have been tried for babies with meconium aspiration syndrome. However, the review of trials found that there is not enough evidence to assess the potential benefits and harms of this treatment.
