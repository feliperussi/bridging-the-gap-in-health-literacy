High doses of opioid drugs for the management of chronic non‐cancer pain
Bottom line 
There is no high‐quality evidence to show how well high doses of opioids work, or what side effects there are, when these medications are used for the treatment of chronic pain that is not due to cancer in adults. Trials typically used doses below our cut‐off; we need to know how well high‐dose opioid medication works in this situation, and what side effects there may be. 
Background 
Opioids are a type of pain medication related to morphine. This overview aimed to summarise the knowledge in Cochrane Reviews and Overviews about opioid drugs. We were interested in opioid medications used at high doses (equivalent to 200 mg of morphine per day or more) for pain relief in adults who have chronic pain not due to cancer. We wanted to describe how well high‐dose opioid medications work in this situation, and what side effects there might be. 
Key results 
Despite a systematic search in April 2017, we did not find any information about this. Studies on opioids rarely reported on high‐dose use and, if so, they did not report separate information for participants who used high‐dose opioids.
