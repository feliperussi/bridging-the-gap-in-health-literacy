Steroid avoidance or withdrawal for pancreas and pancreas with kidney transplant recipients
People with type 1 diabetes and kidney failure have a poor survival. In the clinical course, they suffer from several diabetic vascular complications and usually have progressive kidney impairment. Pancreas transplantation improves survival and quality of life and controls blood glucose without the need for insulin therapy, making pancreas with kidney transplantation the treatment of choice in most patients with type 1 insulin‐dependent diabetes and kidney failure. More than 95% of transplant recipients are treated with steroids as part of their immunosuppression. Steroid treatment has complications including: hypertension, hyperglycaemia or hyperlipidaemia, increase risk of infection, obesity, cataracts, muscle disease, bone metabolism alterations and skin problems. However, without adequate immunosuppression, transplant patients are at risk of transplant rejection and transplant failure. This review looked at two strategies ‐ steroid avoidance and steroid withdrawal ‐ to investigate their impact on short‐ and long‐term outcomes. These strategies could be used in adults in the first few days after transplantation when used in combination with more powerful immunosuppressive agents. Twenty‐one studies were identified and evaluated in this review although only three RCTs enrolling 144 participants met our inclusion criteria. Steroid avoidance and steroid withdrawal strategies in pancreas and pancreas with kidney transplantation were not apparently associated with increased mortality, graft loss or acute rejection, although more studies are needed.
