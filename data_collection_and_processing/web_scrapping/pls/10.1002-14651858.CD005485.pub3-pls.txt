Pressure‐relieving devices for treating heel pressure ulcers
Pressure ulcers (also known as pressure sores, decubitus ulcers and bed sores) are areas of localised damage to the skin and underlying tissue, believed to be caused by pressure, shear or friction. Pressure‐relieving devices such as beds, mattresses, heel troughs, splints and pillows are used as part of the treatment to reduce or relieve the pressure on the ulcer. Heel ulcers were studied specifically as their structure is very different to the other body sites which are prone to pressure ulcers (such as the bottom) and they are more prone to diseases, such as poor circulation, which do not affect other pressure ulcer sites. We identified one study that was at moderate to high risk of bias. This study lost over half the participants to follow up. More high quality research is needed to inform the selection of pressure relieving devices to treat pressure ulcers of the heel.
