No evidence from randomised controlled trials for or against the use of huperzine A in the treatment of people with mild cognitive impairment 
Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is a condition in which a person has problems with memory, language or another mental function severe enough to be noticeable to other people and to show up on tests, but not serious enough to interfere with daily life. Research has shown that individuals with MCI have an increased risk of developing Alzheimer's disease (AD) over the following few years, especially when their main problem is memory. Currently available drug treatments for AD are thought to work by inhibiting the enzyme acetylcholinesterase and hence increasing acetylcholine levels in the brain. However, these drugs have not been shown to be effective for MCI and have numerous side effects. Huperzine A is a herbal medicine that is an alkaloid isolated from the Chinese herb Huperzia serrata. It has also been found to be an inhibitor of acetylcholinesterase and to possess other properties (such as protecting the brain against glutamate‐induced damage, and increasing levels of nerve growth factor), which may have some beneficial effects in MCI. It is used to treat MCI in China, but because no randomised controlled trials of huperzine A versus placebo were found its efficacy and safety could not be analysed in this review. There is a need for randomised placebo‐controlled trials of huperzine A for people with MCI.
