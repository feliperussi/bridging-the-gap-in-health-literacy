Velnacrine is not beneficial for people with Alzheimer's disease
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the commonest cause of dementia affecting older people. One of the therapeutic strategies aimed at ameliorating the clinical manifestations of Alzheimer's disease is to enhance cholinergic neurotransmission in relevant parts of the brain by the use of cholinesterase inhibitors to delay the breakdown of acetylcholine released into synaptic clefts. Tacrine, the first of the cholinesterase inhibitors to undergo extensive trials for this purpose, was associated with significant adverse effects including hepatotoxicity. Velnacrine is a derivative of tacrine. There is evidence that it is toxic in a similar way to tacrine and all research stopped in 1994. The FDA peripheral and CNS drug advisory board voted unanimously against recommending approval.
