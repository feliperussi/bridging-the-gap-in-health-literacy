Extra‐amniotic prostaglandin for induction of labour
Not enough evidence to show any benefit of extra‐amniotic prostaglandin for the induction of labour over other methods. 
Sometimes it is necessary to start labour artificially because of safety concerns for the mother or baby. Drugs can be given as a gel placed inside the vagina or cervix or inside the uterine cavity in the space between the uterine wall and the amniotic sac. This gel is put in place using a catheter. Prostaglandins are drugs that are used to ripen the cervix or help start labour. The review of twelve trials compared different methods of giving prostaglandin to start labour. Extra‐amniotic prostaglandin was found to be effective, but it is more invasive than other methods. There was not enough evidence to show benefits of extra‐amniotic prostaglandin over other methods.
