Kinesthetic stimulation for preventing apnea in preterm infants
Lying preterm babies on oscillating mattresses has not been shown to help prevent apnea. Physical stimulation arouses babies experiencing apnea (episodes where breathing stops), and babies still in utero are naturally stimulated by their mothers' movements. Thus, it has been thought that keeping the baby moving might prevent apnea and promote growth and development. Oscillating (moving) mattresses have sometimes been used for babies born too early (preterm) who are at risk of apnea. However, the review found that this has not been shown to be effective.
