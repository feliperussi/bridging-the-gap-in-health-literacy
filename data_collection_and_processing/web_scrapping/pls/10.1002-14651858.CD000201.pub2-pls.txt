Prophylactic ergometrine‐oxytocin versus oxytocin for the third stage of labour
Ergometrine‐oxytocin (Syntometrine®) is more effective than oxytocin (Syntocinon®) in reducing blood loss during the delivery of the placenta, but has more side‐effects. 
Active management of the third stage of labour, when delivery of the placenta occurs, involves the clinician giving a drug as the baby's shoulder is born, clamping the umbilical cord immediately after birth and putting traction on the cord to speed delivery. This process is widely used to reduce the risk of excessive blood loss. The review of six trials (9332 women) found ergometrine‐oxytocin appears to be associated with less blood loss than oxytocin when a 'moderate' blood loss definition is taken rather than a 'severe' blood loss definition. However, ergometrine‐oxytocin was associated with more side‐effects of vomiting, nausea and high blood pressure.
