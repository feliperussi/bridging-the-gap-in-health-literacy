Small‐incision cholecystectomy and open cholecystectomy seem equivalent considering complications, but small‐incision cholecystectomy is associated with a shorter hospital stay 
The classical open cholecystectomy and the minimally invasive small‐incision cholecystectomy are two alternative operations for removal of the gallbladder. There seem to be no significant differences in mortality and complications between these two techniques. Hospital stay is shorter using the small‐incision operation. This review shows that the small‐incision and open cholecystectomy should be considered equal, apart from a shorter hospital stay using the small‐incision technique.
