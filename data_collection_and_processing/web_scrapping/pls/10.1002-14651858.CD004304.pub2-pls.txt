Vitamins for epilepsy
No evidence that folic acid, thiamine, vitamin D or vitamin E improve seizure control or prevent side effects for people with epilepsy. 
Antiepileptic drugs stop seizures for 70% of people with epilepsy and cause a number of side effects. This review investigated if vitamins improve seizure control or prevent side effects such as gum swelling, memory problems, osteoporosis, problems with blood cell formation and effects on peripheral nerves. The studies reviewed investigated the use of folic acid, thiamine, vitamin D and vitamin E and were of poor methodological quality. There is no conclusive evidence that vitamins improve seizure control or prevent side effects for people with epilepsy. Further studies are needed.
