Dengzhanhua preparations for acute cerebral infarction
There is no clear evidence that dengzhanhua injections benefit patients with acute cerebral infarction. Dengzhanhua preparations are a traditional herbal drug that are commonly used in China to treat disorders of the blood supply to the heart and brain, including stroke. These compounds have a number of actions which might help reduce disability after stroke. The most common type of stroke is cerebral infarction, which is due to blockage of the blood supply to one part of the brain. This review aimed to include randomised or quasi‐randomised trials of dengzhanhua preparations in the treatment of patients with recent cerebral infarction. Nine studies involving 723 participants were included. The studies were of poor quality. Although treatment with dengzhanhua injections appeared to improve neurological function, there was no evidence that treatment improved the chance of being alive and free of disability. This review therefore did not find evidence to support the routine use of dengzhanhua for patients with recent stroke. Further well‐designed trials are needed.
