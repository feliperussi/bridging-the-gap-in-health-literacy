Diposable nappies for preventing nappy rash in babies and infants.
The role of disposable napkins for preventing napkin dermatitis in infants is not yet clear. Although generally not a serious condition, napkin dermatitis is common and causes discomfort for infants, anxiety for carers and burdens the health care system. A variety of napkins are available. Carers and health care workers require evidence to assist in the choice of napkins used. This review found that there was not enough evidence from good quality randomised controlled trials to support or refute the use and type of disposable napkins for the prevention of napkin dermatitis in infants. Better studies need to be done.
