Interventions for heartburn in pregnancy
Heartburn affects more than two‚Äêthirds of women in late pregnancy. Usually it is not serious, but symptoms can be very distressing to pregnant women. There are many different interventions to relieve heartburn including advice on diet and lifestyle and a range of medicines (many of which are available over the counter without prescription). The review authors identified three randomised controlled trials including a total of 286 women focusing on three different heartburn medications. While the results of the individual trials were positive (women described some relief from symptoms), overall it was concluded that there is little information on the safety or effectiveness of drugs used to treat heartburn in pregnancy. More information is needed on this common and distressing condition.
