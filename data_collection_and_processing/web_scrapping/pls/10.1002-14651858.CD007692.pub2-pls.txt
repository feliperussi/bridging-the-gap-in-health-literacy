Danazol for treatment of women with symptoms caused by uterine fibroids
There is no evidence from randomised controlled trials demonstrating that the benefits of danazol outweigh its risks in treating uterine fibroids. Danazol is a synthetic isoxazole derivative chemically related to 17‚Äêethinyl testosterone which creates a high androgen and low estrogen environment, resulting in the wasting of endometrium and shrinkage of fibroids. Despite its benefits, various undesirable side effects have also been reported. These include acne, hirsutism (excess hair in females, with an adult male pattern of distribution), weight gain, irritability, musculoskeletal pain, hot flushes, and breast atrophy, which many women may not tolerate. The review found no evidence demonstrating that the benefits of danazol outweigh the risks in treating uterine fibroids.
