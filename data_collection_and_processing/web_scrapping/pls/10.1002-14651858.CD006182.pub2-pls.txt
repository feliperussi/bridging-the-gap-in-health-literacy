Peritoneal drainage versus laparotomy as initial surgical treatment for perforated necrotizing enterocolitis or spontaneous intestinal perforation in preterm low birth weight infants 
Intestinal perforation is a very serious condition in very premature babies. Standard treatment of intestinal perforation is the surgical opening of the abdomen and removal of the unhealthy or dead intestine. Insertion of a drain into the abdomen instead of surgical opening has been tried to treat this condition. This review did not find any significant advantages or harms of insertion of the drain over surgically opening the abdomen; however, there is too little evidence to fully understand the risks and benefits of this approach.
