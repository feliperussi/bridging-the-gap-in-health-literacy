Anti‚Äêdepressant therapies may be able to help relieve depression in people with Parkinson's disease but more research is needed on safety and effectiveness. 
Parkinson's disease can lead to psychiatric as well as physical symptoms, the most common of which is depression. Oral antidepressants, electroconvulsive therapy or behavioural therapy are currently used in the treatment of depression in Parkinson's disease. No trials were found examining the efficacy of electroconvulsive therapy or behavioural therapy. We identified three trials which examined antidepressant drugs. The review found that there is not enough evidence from the trials about the effects of antidepressant drugs for the treatment of depression in people with Parkinson's disease. Adverse effects in trials so far have not been severe, and included visual hallucinations and confusion.
