Interventions for lowering plasma homocysteine levels in dialysis patients
Background 
People with advanced kidney disease frequently develop heart disease, which is the most common cause of deaths in these people. An increased level of the amino acid (homocysteine) in the blood is a risk factor for heart disease in people with advanced kidney disease. Therapies that reduce homocysteine levels (e.g. folic acid, vitamins B6 and B12) are often used, but the benefits and harms of their use are unclear. We aimed to assess the benefits and harms of homocysteine‐lowering therapies in people with advanced kidney disease who were on dialysis. 
Study characteristics 
From a search of the literature in January 2016, we identified six randomised controlled trials that involved 2452 participants aged between 48 and 65 years to be analysed. 
Key results 
We found that homocysteine‐lowering therapies had no benefits for heart health in people with advanced kidney disease who were on dialysis. These therapies did not achieve any reduction in rates of heart disease‐related death. However, homocysteine‐lowering therapies were generally well tolerated, and had a mild side effect profile. 
Quality of the evidence 
Overall, studies were assessed as high quality.
