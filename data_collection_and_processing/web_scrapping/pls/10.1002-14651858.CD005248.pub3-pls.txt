Intravenous in‐line filters for preventing morbidity and mortality in neonates
Review question: Does the use of in‐line filters on intravenous lines reduce morbidity and mortality in neonates? 
Background: Preterm or sick newborn infants are often fed with nutrients and fluids that are delivered directly into a vein. This intravenous delivery can be associated with infection, toxins released by bacteria, and tiny particles that may be in the fluids, such as rubber and plastic, going into the blood. In adults, placing a filter in the intravenous line has been reported to be effective in reducing such risks, and filters are increasingly being recommended for use in newborn infants. 
Study characteristics: The review authors searched the medical literature and identified four eligible studies that recruited a total of 704 newborns. 
Key findings: Septicaemia and illness, deaths or problems with the intravenous lines were no different with or without a filter. 
Conclusions: There is insufficient evidence to recommend the use of intravenous in‐line filters to prevent morbidity and mortality in newborn infants.
