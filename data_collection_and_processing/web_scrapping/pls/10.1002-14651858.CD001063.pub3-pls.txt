Hands and knees posture in late pregnancy or labour for fetal malposition (lateral or posterior) 
Assuming the hands and knees posture in late pregnancy does not improve pregnancy outcomes but use in labour is beneficial. 
The best position for babies during birth is head down, with the back of their head facing forward. When babies lie with the back of their head towards the mothers' side (lateral) or towards the mothers' back (posterior), the labour may be longer and more painful. The review of three trials (2794 women) found that assuming the hands‐knees position for ten minutes helped the baby to modify position at the time, but suggesting women assume the hands and knees position for ten minutes twice daily during late pregnancy had no effect on longer‐term outcomes in labour. Using this position during labour reduced backache.
