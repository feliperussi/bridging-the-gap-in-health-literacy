Instruments for assessing readiness to commence suck feeds in preterm infants
Review question: Does using an assessment tool which has been designed to assess preterm infants' readiness to commence breast or bottle feeding improve feeding outcomes and decrease length of stay? 
Background: Unlike babies born at term, who are able to breast or bottle feed soon after birth, preterm infants need time to learn to feed. This may take days or weeks after they are born. Preterm babies commence breast or bottle feeding at a time when the baby is deemed to be ready, as determined by healthcare professionals looking after the baby. The optimal timing of the introduction of suck feeds is unclear in both the literature and in practice. An individualised assessment specifically designed to assess an individual infant's readiness to commence breast or bottle feeding has been suggested as the best way to promote consistency in identifying when it is safe for an infant to commence breast or bottle feeding. 
Study characteristics: No studies were found that met the inclusion criteria on this review. 
Key results/Conclusion: Although a limited number of assessment tools to determine feeding readiness currently exist, no studies were found that evaluated the benefit or risk to the preterm infant. As a result, it is unclear to what extent a feeding readiness tool would assist healthcare professionals to decide when to introduce breast or bottle feeding to the preterm infant. 
Quality of evidence: No evidence was found.
