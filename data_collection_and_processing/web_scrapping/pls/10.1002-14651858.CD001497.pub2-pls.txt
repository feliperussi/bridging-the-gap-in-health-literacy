Can illegal cigarette sales to underage youth be prevented, and does it change their smoking behaviour 
If young people are unable to purchase cigarettes it may reduce the number who start to smoke. Various interventions including warnings and fines for retailers who illegally make sales to underage youth have been shown to reduce the proportion of retailers who are willing to sell tobacco during compliance checks. However it has been difficult to demonstrate a clear effect on young smokers' perceptions of how easily they can buy cigarettes, or on their smoking behaviour.
