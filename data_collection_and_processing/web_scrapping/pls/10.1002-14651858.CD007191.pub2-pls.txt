Interventions for the prevention of mycobacterium avium complex in adults and children with HIV 
Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) infection is a common complication of advanced acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) disease and can shorten the survival of these patients. We sought to examine effectiveness of all drugs for preventing MAC infection in adults and children with HIV infection. This review included eight trials conducted in the USA and Europe, published between 1993 and 2003. 
We found evidence (very‚Äêlow to low grade) that azithromycin or clarithromycin appeared to be a drug of choice for preventing MAC infection. There is a need for further studies to compare direct evidence between clarithromycin and azithromycin and studies to determine the optimal doses required for effective prevention of MAC infection.
