Five‐alpha‐reductase inhibitor drugs, such as finasteride or dutasteride, reduce the risk prostate cancer in men who have routine prostate cancer screening 
Five‐alpha‐reductase inhibitor drugs have potential as chemopreventive agents. Reduction of prostate cancer was similar between racial groups, age groups (aged 65 years or older compared to younger age groups) and those with or without a family history of prostate cancer. Reduction of prostate cancer was limited to men who had a baseline prostate specific antigen (PSA) values less than 4.0 ng/mL. However, use of five‐alpha‐reductase inhibitors may also increase the risk of high‐grade prostate cancer in men undergoing prostate cancer screening. Future research is needed to determine if the use of five‐alpha‐reductase inhibitors can reduce prostate cancer in men who are not being regularly screened for prostate cancer. Future studies should also determine whether five‐alpha‐reductase inhibitors can reduce death and prostate cancer death and further evaluate the risk of developing high‐grade prostate cancer.
