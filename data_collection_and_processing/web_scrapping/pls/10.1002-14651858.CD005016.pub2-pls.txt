Does haemodialysis membrane type influence outcomes in people with kidney disease?
Haemodialysis removes excess fluid and metabolic products from the blood in people who have limited kidney function. Haemodialysis membranes are classified as high‐flux or low‐flux based on their ability to remove fluid and molecules. It has been suggested that removal of larger solutes across high‐flux haemodialysis membranes may better reflect normal kidney function and improve clinical outcomes. To investigate this issue, we analysed 33 studies that involved 3820 people which directly compared haemodialysis using high‐flux or low‐flux membranes. 
We found that high‐flux dialysis membranes reduced deaths from heart and circulatory (cardiovascular) causes by 17%, but did not reduce overall risk of death. This means that if 100 people were treated with high‐flux dialysis for approximately two years, three deaths from cardiovascular causes may be prevented in people who need long‐term haemodialysis. 
Based on the available evidence, we could not be certain that the type of membrane flux involved had any effect on deaths from infection, hospital admissions, joint problems due to long term dialysis, quality of life, or kidney function in people on long‐term haemodialysis.
