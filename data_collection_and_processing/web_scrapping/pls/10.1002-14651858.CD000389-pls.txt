Mass media communication can encourage increased utilisation of health services
Mass media information on health‚Äêrelated issues may induce changes in health services utilisation, both through planned campaigns and unplanned coverage. Further research could target how best to compose media messages, and whether they have a different impact on members of the public and health professionals. More information is needed on whether mass media coverage brings about appropriate use of services in those patients who will benefit most.
