Oral potassium iodide for the treatment of sporotrichosis
Potassium iodide is an anti‚Äêfungal drug listed in the World Health Organization (WHO) essential drug list and generally thought to be the first choice for cutaneous sporotrichosis including fixed and lymphocutaneous types, in developing countries. No randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of oral potassium iodide versus placebo were found and thus its efficacy and safety could not be analysed in this review. There is a need for randomised placebo controlled trials of oral potassium iodide in this area.
