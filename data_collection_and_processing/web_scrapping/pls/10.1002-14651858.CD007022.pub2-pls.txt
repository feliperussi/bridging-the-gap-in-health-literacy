Teicoplanin versus vancomycin for proven or suspected infection
One of the most common bacteria responsible for human diseases is Staphylococcus aureus, which causes mainly skin, lung and blood infections. In many cases, especially in infections acquired inside a hospital, usual antibiotics are ineffective and more aggressive drugs are needed. Teicoplanin and vancomycin are both effective against this bacteria, however, there is a concern that vancomycin may be more toxic, especially for the kidneys. This review identified 24 studies enrolling 2,610 patients comparing teicoplanin and vancomycin in those with either proven or suspected infection. Teicoplanin was as effective as vancomycin for treating infections caused by Staphylococcus aureus with similar results for clinical cure, microbiological cure and death. However, there were less adverse events (skin rash and red man syndrome) and it caused significantly less damage to the kidneys.
