Prophylactic antibiotics to reduce morbidity and mortality in ventilated newborn infants
There is insufficient evidence from randomised trials to either support or refute the routine use of preventive antibiotics in newborn babies with breathing tubes in place. Newborn babies occasionally require a tube in the windpipe to help them breathe. The use of a breathing may cause the baby to develop an infection and become sick. Some people believe that antibiotics should be given to all babies with breathing tubes in order to reduce the chance of an infection occurring. However, antibiotics can have unwanted effects. It is possible that these effects might be worse than any benefit gained. The reviewers found insufficient evidence to either support or refute the routine use of antibiotics for all babies with breathing tubes.
