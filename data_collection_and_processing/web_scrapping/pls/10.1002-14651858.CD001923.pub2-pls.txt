Carotid endarterectomy for asymptomatic carotid stenosis
For most people with a narrowing of the carotid artery which is not causing symptoms a surgical operation to remove the narrowing carries a risk and has little benefit. Carotid stenosis is a narrowing of a major artery in the neck taking blood to the brain. This can cause a stroke. If the narrowing is severe and has caused symptoms, surgery to remove the narrowing (carotid endarterectomy) reduces the risk of stroke. However, if the narrowing has not caused any symptoms the risk of stroke is not very high. Although this low risk can be lowered further by surgery, the surgery itself can sometimes cause a stroke or death. The overall effect of surgery is a small benefit.
