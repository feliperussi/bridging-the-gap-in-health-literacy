Newer alternative fat emulsions versus the conventional pure soybean oil based fat emulsions for intravenous nutrition in preterm infants. 
Review question: Are the newer alternative fat emulsions better than the conventional pure soybean oil based fat emulsions for improving outcomes in preterm infants? 
Background: Preterm infants who need nutrition through intravenous lines have been conventionally given pure soy oil based fat emulsions. High polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) content in pure soy oil based emulsions can, however, be harmful to preterm infants. The newer lipid emulsions (LE) from alternative lipid sources with reduced PUFA content may improve clinical outcomes in preterm infants. 
Study characteristics: Review authors searched the medical literature and identified fifteen eligible studies (including 979 infants). 
Key findings: All LE in this review appeared to be safe and were well tolerated in preterm infants. This review did not find any significant differences in the clinically important outcomes of death, growth, lung disease or severe eye disease (retinopathy of prematurity ≥ stage 3) with the use of newer alternative LE compared with the conventional pure soy oil based LE. 
Conclusions: Based on this review, there is insufficient evidence to recommend any of the newer alternative LE over the conventional pure soy oil based LE or vice‐versa. Further studies are required to evaluate the effectiveness of newer LE compared with conventional pure soy based LE in preterm infants.
