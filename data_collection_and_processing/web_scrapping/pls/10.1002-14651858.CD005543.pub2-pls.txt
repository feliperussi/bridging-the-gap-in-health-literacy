Intrapartum interventions for preventing shoulder dystocia
It is not clear whether altering maternal posture or applying external pressure to the mother's pelvis before birth helps the baby's shoulders pass through the birth canal. 
Various manoeuvres are used to assist the passage of the baby through the birth canal by manipulating the fetal shoulders and increasing the functional size of the pelvis. These manoeuvres can also be used before the baby's head appears to prevent the fetal shoulders becoming trapped in the maternal pelvis (shoulder dystocia). In this review, the two studies involving 25 women were not large enough to show if manoeuvres such as manipulating the mother's pelvis can prevent instances of shoulder dystocia. Rates of birth injury did not appear to be affected by carrying out the manoeuvres early. Neither study addressed important maternal outcomes such as maternal injury, psychological outcomes and satisfaction with birth. Because shoulder dystocia is a rare occurrence, more studies involving larger groups of women are required to properly assess the benefits and adverse outcomes associated with such interventions.
