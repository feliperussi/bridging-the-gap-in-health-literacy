Drains are often used after thyroid operations.
People who undergo thyroid surgery are thought to be at risk of respiratory distress, wound infections, excessive fluid accumulation and increased stay in hospital stay. Concerns about these complications lead surgeons to insert drains after the procedure. This review found no evidence of benefit in the use of drains for improving patient outcomes, but their use may be associated with an increased length of hospital stay.
