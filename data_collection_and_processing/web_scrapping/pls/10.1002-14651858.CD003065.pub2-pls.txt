Tracheal suctioning without disconnection in intubated, ventilated neonates
Sometimes newborn babies have trouble breathing and need mechanical help. Air can be supplied through a tube inserted into their nose, mouth or trachea (windpipe). There are some potential problems with the tube. Soft tissue can be damaged increasing secretion of fluids that can block the tube, raise blood pressure or cause damage and infections. Using suction to clear the tubes can be done either with or without disconnection from the ventilator. The review of trials found there was some evidence that suctioning without disconnection improves stability. These improvements were small so this can not be recommended as the only way to suction the babies. More research is needed.
