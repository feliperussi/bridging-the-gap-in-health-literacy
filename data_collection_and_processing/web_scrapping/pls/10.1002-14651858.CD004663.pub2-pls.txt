Techniques and materials for closure of the abdominal wall in caesarean section
There is not enough evidence to say whether particular techniques for closing the abdominal wall during caesarean section are better than others. 
Different techniques and suture materials are used in caesarean section for closure of the rectus sheath (fibrous material enclosing the muscles of the abdominal wall). No research has examined whether any technique for closing the rectus sheath is preferable. The subcutaneous fat (between the sheath and the skin) may be left to heal without suturing, or can be closed using a variety of techniques. Closing the subcutaneous fat may reduce the risk of some wound complications (haematoma and seroma) but further research is needed to investigate how these outcomes affect the well‚Äêbeing and recovery of the women concerned.
