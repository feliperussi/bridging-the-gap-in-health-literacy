Studies urgently needed to assess effects of Personal Assistance for children and teens with both physical and intellectual impairments 
Personal assistance is here defined as paid support of at least 20 hours per week for people with impairments. This review investigated the effectiveness of personal assistance versus any other form of care for children and adolescents with both physical and intellectual impairments. A literature search identified no studies that met the inclusion criteria. This review is part of a series of reviews; evidence from related reviews about different populations might be informative to researchers and practitioners.
