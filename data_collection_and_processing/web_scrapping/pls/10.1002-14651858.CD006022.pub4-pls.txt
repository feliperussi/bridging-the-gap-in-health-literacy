Dietary interventions for preventing complications in idiopathic hypercalciuria
Hypercalciuria, an inherited metabolic condition, is the presence of excessive calcium in the urine. The cause is often unknown (idiopathic), and may occur in people who are otherwise well. Although people with the condition have normal levels of calcium in their blood, calcium is lost through the urine. 
Adults with hypercalciuria are prone to developing kidney stones and losing calcium from their bones. In children, hypercalciuria can cause blood in the urine (haematuria), frequency‚Äêdysuria syndrome (frequent painful or difficult urination), urinary tract infections, abdominal and back pain. 
It has been suggested that altering the diets of people with hypercalciuria could help to prevent complications of the condition. We therefore aimed to evaluate the benefits and harms of dietary interventions that had been investigated in clinical studies. We included five studies in our review, one of which compared a low calcium diet with a diet that included normal levels of calcium, low protein, low salt over five years. This study found that diets unrestricted for calcium intake significantly decreased numbers of new kidney stones. 
Other dietary interventions, such as unprocessed wheat bran, did not show any evidence of beneficial effects. 
We did not find any studies in children, and none investigating specific dietary recommendations for those who had hypercalciuria without symptoms.
