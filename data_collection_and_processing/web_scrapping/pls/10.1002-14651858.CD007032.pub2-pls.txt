Acanthopanax for acute ischaemic stroke
Most strokes take place when a blood clot blocks a blood vessel leading to the brain. Without a proper blood supply, the brain quickly suffers damage, which can be permanent. The damage from a stroke can cause arm or leg weakness, or difficulties with language or vision. Data from some experimental and human studies have suggested acanthopanax, a traditional Chinese medicine, may be beneficial for people with acute ischaemic stroke. It has been used in China for many years to treat stroke. To obtain a reliable assessment of the effects of acanthopanax in acute ischaemic stroke, we reviewed data from 13 studies involving 962 participants. The quality of the trials was poor, and there was not enough evidence to support the routine use of acanthopanax in the treatment of acute ischaemic stroke. More high‚Äêquality trials are needed.
