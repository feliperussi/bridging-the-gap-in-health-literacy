Alexander technique for chronic asthma
During an asthma attack, the airways narrow, causing breathing problems, wheezing and coughing. Asthma can be caused by allergies, pollens, stress or air pollution and can be fatal. The Alexander Technique is a form of therapy involving a series of movements designed to correct posture and bring the body into natural alignment and aid relaxation. The Alexander technique has been used by people with asthma, to try and improve breathing. The review of trials found there was not enough evidence to show the effects of the Alexander Technique in reducing the need to use medication for asthma. More research is needed.
