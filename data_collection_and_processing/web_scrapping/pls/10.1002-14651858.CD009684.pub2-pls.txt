Use of zonisamide for the treatment of essential tremor
Review question 
The authors of this review tried to assess the effectiveness and safety of zonisamide in people (16 years or older) with essential tremor. 
Background 
Essential tremor is the most common movement disorder. Although benign, in term of its effect on life expectancy, it is typically progressive and potentially disabling. The treatment is primarily based on pharmacological agents (propranolol and primidone as first‐line therapy) but these are ineffective in 25% to 55% of participants. Zonisamide has been suggested as a potentially useful agent for the treatment of essential tremor. 
Study characteristics 
We found one study comparing zonisamide versus placebo, involving a total of 20 randomised participants with essential tremor. 
Key results 
The impact of zonisamide on functional abilities, risk of treatment discontinuation, and adverse events is uncertain because the quality of evidence is very low. Adverse events were only reported in participants from the zonisamide group, making it possible that they were aware of which treatment they had been receiving. Quality of life was not assessed in the study included. 
Quality of evidence 
The single study we found was small and the possibility of study participants becoming aware of the treatment group means that we cannot be certain about the risk‐benefit profile of this treatment.
