Interventions designed to prevent healthcare bed‐related injuries in patients
Patients in hospitals, nursing care facilities and rehabilitation units sometimes fall out of bed. Associated injuries include skin lacerations, bone fractures, joint dislocations and brain haemorrhage, and these injuries may result in permanent disability and death. Bed rails are the most common intervention designed to prevent patients falling out of bed. However, reports of fatal bed rail entrapment have caused uncertainty regarding their use. Determining which interventions effectively and safely prevent patient injuries from their beds would be beneficial and allow healthcare staff an evidence‐based practice. 
Two randomised studies are included in this review. Both studies targeted patients most likely to fall. One trial was of low height beds (22,036 patients) and the other investigated bed exit alarms (70 patients). The results of each study showed there is no significant increase or decrease in the rate of injuries or falls from bed. Although one study was large, fewer than half of the patients received a low height bed and so this group of patients may have been too small to detect a statistically significant benefit or harm in the analysis. 
No randomised controlled trials of bed rails were found. The researchers suggest that future reports should fully describe what standard care was received by the control group.
