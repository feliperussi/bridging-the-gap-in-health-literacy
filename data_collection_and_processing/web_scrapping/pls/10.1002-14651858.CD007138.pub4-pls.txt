Enteral lactoferrin for the treatment of sepsis and necrotizing enterocolitis in neonates
Review question 
Is lactoferrin supplementation, along with antibiotics, effective and safe for babies with sepsis and necrotizing enterocolitis? 
Background 
Newborn babies, especially those born preterm, are at risk from infections in the blood (sepsis), gastrointestinal inflammation and injury (necrotizing enterocolitis), or both these conditions. A number of babies with sepsis or necrotizing enterocolitis die or suffer from long‚Äêterm brain and lung damage, despite treatment with antibiotics. Lactoferrin, a substance normally present in human milk, may be effective against infections and gastrointestinal injury. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies that used lactoferrin supplementation feeds to treat babies with infection or gastrointestinal injury. 
Key results 
We did not find any studies on lactoferrin supplementation with antibiotics in treating babies with sepsis and necrotizing enterocolitis. It is unlikely that lactoferrin will be used for treatment of infection or intestinal inflammation in preterm babies because it has not been found effective to prevent these illnesses. During infection and intestinal problems feeds are usually not given. We do not recommend studies be done in the future to address this issue. 
Quality of evidence 
This could not be assessed as no eligible studies were identified.
