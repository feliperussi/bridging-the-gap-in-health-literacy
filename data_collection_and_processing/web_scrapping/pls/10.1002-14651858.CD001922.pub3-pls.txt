Physical methods for preventing deep vein thrombosis in stroke
After a stroke, blood clots can form in the veins of the legs (deep vein thrombosis, or DVT). These clots can break off and be carried in the blood stream to the heart and lungs (causing pulmonary embolism). This can be life threatening. Although anticoagulant drugs can reduce the risk of DVT they can also cause serious bleeding. A number of physical methods have been developed to prevent DVT forming. These include wearing graduated compression stockings, intermittent pneumatic compression and electrical stimulation of leg muscles. The physical methods are used to increase the blood flow in the leg veins and reduce the risk of clots forming. We aimed to evaluate the effects of these physical methods in patients with a recent stroke. We found two randomised trials of graduated compression stockings, involving 2615 participants, and two small trials of intermittent pneumatic compression involving 177 participants. Graduated compression stockings were no better than 'best medical treatment' in reducing the risk of DVT after stroke. Stockings caused more skin problems (for example ulcers and blisters) on the legs. Intermittent pneumatic compression appeared promising but was not proven to be definitely beneficial. The evidence does not support routine use of graduated compression stockings or intermittent pneumatic compression in patients with a recent stroke. The trials that are ongoing at present should provide reliable evidence on the benefits and harms of intermittent pneumatic compression.
