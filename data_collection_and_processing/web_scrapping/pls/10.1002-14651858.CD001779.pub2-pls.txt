Not enough evidence on routine antibiotics to prevent infection for women seeking care after incomplete abortion, but a single dose may be more suitable 
Incomplete abortions cause many complications and the deaths of tens of thousands of women each year. Women who seek health care after an incomplete abortion usually come for problems from bleeding too much or infection. Antibiotics are generally given when there are signs of infection. The review of trials showed difficulties for women in continuing to take antibiotics and returning for care, so single dose antibiotics may be more suitable in these circumstances. The trials did not provide enough evidence to show the effects of routine antibiotics for women after incomplete abortion.
