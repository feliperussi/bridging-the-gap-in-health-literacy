The effect of amantadine for the treatment of fatigue in people with multiple sclerosis
Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic disease affecting young and middle‐aged adults. One of the most common and disabling symptoms of MS is fatigue. Different approaches have been used to try and improve this, including energy conservation, specialised fitness training and drug treatments. Amantadine has been used to try to relieve fatigue in MS. This review found that Amantadine efficacy in reducing MS‐related fatigue and its tolerability are poorly documented and more research is needed.
