Pharmacological treatment for Kleine‐Levin syndrome
Background 
Kleine‐Levin syndrome (KLS) is a rare disorder that mainly affects adolescent men. It is characterised by recurrent episodes of hypersomnia (excessive sleepiness), hyperphagia (overeating), and abnormal behaviour. The frequency and nature of the attacks can disrupt the individual's social, professional, and family life. The cause of KLS is not known. Several treatments have been used, including stimulant, anti‐epileptic, anti‐depressant, and anti‐psychotic drugs, with some benefit reported, but because of the rarity of the condition, long‐term follow‐up of participants is difficult. 
Objectives 
The authors of this review aimed to identify and evaluate randomised controlled trials (RCTs) studying the effectiveness of pharmacological treatment for Kleine‐Levin syndrome. 
Results 
We were not able to find any RCTs. Good‐quality evidence is therefore lacking, and therapeutic trials with a double‐blind, placebo‐controlled design are needed. 
The evidence was current to 7 April 2016.
