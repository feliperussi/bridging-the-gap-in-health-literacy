Multiple versus single lumen umbilical venous catheters for newborn infants
Umbilical venous catheters (UVCs) are frequently used in newborn infants. These tubes into the body can have a single channel (lumen) or they can have two or three channels (multiple lumens). With more than one channel, multi‐lumen umbilical venous catheters (ML‐UVCs) can provide access for multiple purposes: for instance, administration of nutrition, blood products, or therapeutic drugs. It seems logical that use of ML‐UVCs would lower the need for additional venous lines, but this needs confirmation.  Complications associated with UVCs are also a consideration. The channel diameter is generally narrower in ML‐UVCs. This could increase blockage and blood clot risks.  Three clinical trials involving/completed by 113 babies were identified that compared double‐lumen catheters to single‐lumen catheters. None of the studies used triple‐lumen catheters. All three trials found that use of a double‐lumen catheter lowered the number of additional venous placements needed during the first week of life.  The double‐lumen catheters, however, clogged, leaked, and broke more often. In these studies, no significant difference was found in catheter placement difficulty and misplacement, catheter‐related infections or blood clots, other serious complications, or rate of infant mortality. But the quality of studies was poor, and sample sizes were too small to draw valid conclusions about many complication rates. Available clinical trials at present do not provide a basis for recommending one catheter type over another in this setting.
