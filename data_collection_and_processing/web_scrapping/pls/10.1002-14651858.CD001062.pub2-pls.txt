Abdominal decompression in normal pregnancy
Abdominal decompression is a procedure during which a negative pressure is applied intermittently to a pregnant woman's abdomen, enclosed within an airtight frame. It is thought to improve the mother's blood flow to the placenta, and during labour to relieve pain. The review of three studies of abdominal decompression used for healthy pregnant women found no benefits with respect to high blood pressure in the mother nor the newborn baby's condition and subsequent intellectual development. Avenues for further research remain.
