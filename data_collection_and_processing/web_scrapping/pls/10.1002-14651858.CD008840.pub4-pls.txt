Newborn screening for homocystinuria
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence to determine if newborn population screening for the diagnosis of homocystinuria due to cystathionine beta synthase deficiency leads to clinical improvement compared to later clinical diagnosis and to determine the psychological effects on parents or carers of newborn population screening for homocystinuria. This is an update of a previously published review. 
Background 
Homocystinuria is a rare condition caused by mistakes in a gene that is responsible for making an enzyme called cystathionine beta synthase. People with homocystinuria have a deficiency of this enzyme and as a result have high levels of a substance called homocysteine in their bodies. Although such individuals appear normal at birth, over a period of months and years, they develop serious problems that effect eyesight, lead to delayed mental development, cause unhealthy bones, and have a high risk of having blood clots. Treatment with a special diet and medicines can prevent the development of these complications, but must be started very early in life to be truly effective. In some parts of the world homocystinuria has been tested for in newborn babies. 
Search date 
The evidence is current to: 08 June 2015.
Key results 
No trials were found. We know of some uncontrolled studies which suggest that newborn screening for homocystinuria and its early treatment are effective. Future long‚Äêterm research is needed to provide strong evidence for or against screening. This research may also show whether screening is cost effective.
