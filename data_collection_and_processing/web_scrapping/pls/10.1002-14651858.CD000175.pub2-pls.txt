Prophylactic intravenous preloading for regional analgesia in labour
The effect of giving intravenous fluid to prevent low blood pressure, following regional analgesia for women in labour, is unclear. 
Regional (epidural, spinal or combined spinal‐epidural) analgesia is a common form of pain relief used during labour. Some women have hypotension (low blood pressure) following regional analgesia which can affect both mother and baby. Intravenous fluids before epidural analgesia with high‐dose local anaesthetics reduces hypotension. This benefit is not seen when the more recent low‐dose local anaesthetics are used, probably due to a lower risk of hypotension with these drugs. There was not enough evidence to show whether preloading is beneficial for women having regional analgesia during labour using the lower‐dose agents, or for women with pregnancy complications.
