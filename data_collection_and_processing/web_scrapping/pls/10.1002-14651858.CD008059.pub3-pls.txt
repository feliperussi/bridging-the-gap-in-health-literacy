Hyperbaric oxygen therapy for acute surgical and traumatic wounds
Acute surgical and traumatic wounds occur as a result of a trauma or surgical procedures and whilst many heal uneventfully, sometimes poor local blood supply, infection, damage to the blood vessels, or a combination of factors result in these acute wounds taking longer to heal. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT), which involves placing the person in an airtight chamber and administering 100% oxygen at a pressure greater than 1 atmosphere, is sometimes used with the aim of speeding wound healing. The aim is to bathe all fluids, tissues and cells of the body in a high concentration of oxygen. 
This review did not find any high quality research evidence showing that HBOT is beneficial for wound healing. Two poor quality studies suggested benefits associated with HBOT. The first, in patients with crush injuries, showed improved wound healing and fewer adverse outcomes. The second reported improved survival of split skin grafts in people with burn wounds. Two trials reported no benefits associated with HBOT for either skin grafting or free flap surgery. 
Further, better quality research is needed to determine the effects of HBOT on wound healing.
