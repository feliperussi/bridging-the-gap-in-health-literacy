Single dose oral tiaprofenic acid for acute postoperative pain in adults
Pain is commonly experienced after surgical procedures. The condition is usually used to test whether or not drugs are effective painkillers in participants with moderate or severe pain. In this case we could find no studies that tested oral tiaprofenic acid against placebo. It is possible that the studies were done, but not reported, because they were used only to register tiaprofenic acid with licensing authorities throughout the world. However, this leaves an important gap in our knowledge, and it means that we cannot be confident about using oral tiaprofenic acid for acute painful conditions.
