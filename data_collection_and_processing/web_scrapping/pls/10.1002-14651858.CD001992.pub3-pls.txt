Cyclo‚Äêoxygenase (COX) inhibitors for treating preterm labour
Not enough evidence on whether COX inhibitors administered to women in threatened premature labour may reduce the risk of babies being born too early. 
Babies born too early are at increased risk of serious illness, and often do not survive. COX inhibitors inhibit uterine contractions, so may postpone birth to allow the administration of steroids to the mother to help mature the baby's lungs. COX inhibitors may have adverse effects on the baby's heart, lungs and kidneys, and on the mother. Other drugs given for premature labour also have side effects. This review found that COX inhibitors may be better than no treatment, or other drugs, in reducing the number of babies born too early; however, there is insufficient evidence on possible adverse effects.
