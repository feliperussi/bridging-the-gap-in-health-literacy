Interventions for apraxia of speech following stroke
No evidence was found for the treatment of apraxia of speech, a communication disorder that can affect stroke patients. Patients with apraxia of speech know what they want to say, but are unable to carry out the speech movements due to their inability to programme the required sequence. For example, a patient may be able to say goodbye when leaving someone (automatic), but not when asked to say goodbye out of context (volitional). Several types of treatment interventions have been identified; however, we were unable to find any clinical trials of these.
