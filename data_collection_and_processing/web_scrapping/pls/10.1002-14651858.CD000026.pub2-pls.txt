Prevention of fungal infections in patients with cancer with antifungal drugs
Cancer patients receiving chemotherapy or a bone marrow transplant are at risk of fungal infections. These can be life‚Äêthreatening, especially when they spread throughout the body. Those patients with low white cell counts (neutropenia) are particularly at risk. Antifungal drugs are often given as a routine preventive measure, or when people who are at risk have a fever. The review found that intravenous amphotericin B could reduce the number of deaths. Three of the drugs, amphotericin B, fluconazole and itraconazole, reduced fungal infections.
