Ideal length of treatment for Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) eradication
The ideal duration of therapy for H. pylori eradication is controversial, with recommendations ranging from 7 to 14 days. A proton pump inhibitor (PPI) plus two antibiotics is the most commonly used first treatment to remove H. pylori infection. Current data suggest that increasing the length of treatment to 14 days of a PPI plus amoxicillin and clarithromycin or amoxicillin and a nitroimidazole significantly increases the eradication rate, while increasing the adverse events by a small amount. Based on the overall evidence, the ideal length of treatment with a PPI plus amoxicillin and clarithromycin is at least 14 days.
