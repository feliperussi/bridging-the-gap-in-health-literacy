Non‐invasive positive pressure ventilation for prevention of complications after pulmonary resection in lung cancer patients 
Review question: Is the use of non‐invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) safe and effective to prevent complications in the postoperative period in patients who underwent pulmonary resection for lung cancer? 
Background: Death after major lung surgery for lung cancer resection is usually caused by complications, particularly lung complications, in the first week or so. Some experts recommend the use of NIPPV, a technique that provides pressurised gas to the airway, inflating the lungs through a mask without using any tubes put into the nostrils or main airway. 
Search date: The search was last updated on December 21, 2018. 
Study characteristics: We found seven randomised clinical trials and one quasi‐randomised trial suitable for this review, involving a total of 486 patients. 
Key results: When we put all the results together we could not show that using NIPPV was any better than not using it at preventing complications such as death, breathing problems, the need for extra breathing tubes or the length of stay in intensive care unit or in hospital. However, we thought the studies had problems with their methods and that the quality of evidence was either 'very low' or 'moderate'.
