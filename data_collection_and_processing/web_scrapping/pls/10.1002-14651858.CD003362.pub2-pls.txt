Male circumcision for prevention of heterosexual acquisition of HIV in men
Results from three large randomised controlled trials conducted in Africa have shown strong evidence that male circumcision prevents men in the general population from acquiring HIV from heterosexual sex. At a local level, further research will be needed to assess whether implementing the intervention is feasible, appropriate, and cost‚Äêeffective in different settings.
