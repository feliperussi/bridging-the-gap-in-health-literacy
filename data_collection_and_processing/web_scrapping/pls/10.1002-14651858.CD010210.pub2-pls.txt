Single dose oral ibuprofen plus paracetamol (acetaminophen) for acute postoperative pain 
Acute pain is often felt soon after injury, and most people who have surgery will have pain of moderate or severe intensity without treatment for their pain. In many, though not all, circumstances, the pain can be treated with oral analgesics. Many oral analgesics are available, and this review is one of a series examining how effective each one is, at particular doses. 
This review examines a combination of fixed doses of ibuprofen and paracetamol (known as acetaminophen in the USA and some parts of the world). Both are commonly used analgesics, which probably work by different mechanisms. We know that combining different analgesics in the same tablet gives good pain relief to more people than either analgesic alone, at the same dose. 
This review found data in three clinical trials, involving 1647 people with moderate or severe pain after having wisdom teeth removed. This is used commonly to test analgesic effectiveness, because results are applicable to other forms of acute pain after trauma. 
Ibuprofen 200 mg plus paracetamol 500 mg or ibuprofen 400 mg plus paracetamol 1000 mg provided effective pain relief for about 7 in 10 (70%) of participants, compared with just under 1 in 10 (7%) of participants with placebo. The analgesic effects lasted longer and there were fewer adverse events with the combinations than with placebo.
