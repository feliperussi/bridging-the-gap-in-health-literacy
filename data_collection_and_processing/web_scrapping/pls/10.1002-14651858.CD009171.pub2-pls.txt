Vasopressin and its analogues for the treatment of refractory hypotension in neonates
Hypotension or low blood pressure occurs frequently in newborn infants after infection or surgery or in very preterm infants. Sometimes, the hypotension does not respond to fluids or other drug such as catecholamines or steroids. In those unresponsive infants, vasopressin may be useful in improving blood pressure and overall survival. We searched the literature for studies that used vasopressin or its analogue terlipressin in the newborn in the first 28 days of life for unresponsive hypotension. We found no ongoing or completed studies. Currently there is no evidence to recommend the use of vasopressin or terlipressin, but we recommend that studies be carried out in the future to study the effectiveness and safety in unresponsive hypotension in newborn infants.
