Radiofrequency denervation for neck and back pain
Radiofrequency denervation can relieve pain from neck joints, but may not relieve pain originating from lumbar discs, and its impact on low‐back joint pain is uncertain. 
Ongoing neck or back pain can be caused by a joint or damaged disc between two vertebral joints. Injections to block these specific joint nerves can pinpoint if this is the source of the pain. Radiofrequency denervation aims to de‐activate the nerve responsible by applying electric current to cauterise it (damage with heat). 
The review found that radiofrequency denervation can provide short‐term pain relief for a small proportion of people with specific joint problems in the neck. There is conflicting evidence about effects for low‐back joint pain, and some evidence that it does not relieve pain from low‐back disc problems.
