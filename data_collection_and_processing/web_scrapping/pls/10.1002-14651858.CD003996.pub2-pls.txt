Preventative antibiotics (prophylaxis) in clean and clean‐contaminated ear surgery
Ear surgery, as surgery in general, can be divided into several categories: clean, clean‐contaminated, contaminated and dirty surgery. Postoperative complications can include wound infection, discharge from the outer ear canal, labyrinthitis and graft failure. This review aimed to demonstrate whether the use of antibiotic prophylaxis in ear surgery can be helpful in reducing postoperative complications in clean or clean‐contaminated surgery. There is no current evidence from randomised controlled trials showing that there is any antibiotic substance, in any regime, which can contribute to reducing complications in any type of clean or clean‐contaminated surgical procedure in the ear.
