Anti‐D administration in pregnancy for preventing Rhesus alloimmunisation
Women whose blood group is Rh‐negative sometimes form Rh‐antibodies when carrying a Rh‐positive baby, in response to the baby's different red blood cell make‐up. This sensitisation is more likely to happen during birth, but occasionally occurs in late pregnancy. These antibodies can cause anaemia, and sometimes death, for a Rh‐positive baby in a subsequent pregnancy. Giving the mother anti‐D after the first birth is known to reduce this problem. This review assessed two trials with moderate to high risk of bias and found that giving anti‐D during pregnancy may help as well, although more research is required to confirm these possible benefits and identify any possible harms.
