Sargramostim (GM‚ÄêCSF) for induction of remission in Crohn's disease
Crohn's disease is a chronic inflammatory condition of the gut. New theories regarding the cause of this inflammation has led some investigators to think it is a weak immune system, rather than an overactive one, that leads to this condition. They tested this idea using a drug called sargramostim, which boosts the immune system, in patients with Crohn's disease. This review of three studies did not show any difference in effectiveness between sargramostim and placebo (fake drug) for induction of remission or clinical improvement in patients with active Crohn's disease. Side effects associated with sargramostim treatment included bone pain, musculoskeletal chest pain, and dyspnea (shortness of breath). Due to the fact that there were only a small number of trials in this area and some of them give opposite results, the authors concluded that while sargramostim does not appear to be more effective than placebo more research is needed to determine if this drug provides a benefit for the treatment of active Crohn's disease.
