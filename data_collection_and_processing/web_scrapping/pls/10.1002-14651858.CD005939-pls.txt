Rest during pregnancy for preventing pre窶親clampsia and its complications in women with normal blood pressure 
Not enough evidence to say if rest is helpful in preventing pre窶親clampsia and its complications for women with normal blood pressure during pregnancy. 
Pre窶親clampsia is a serious complication of pregnancy occurring in about 2% to 8% of women. It is identified by increased blood pressure and protein in the urine, but women often suffer no symptoms initially. It can, through constriction of the blood vessels in the placenta, interfere with food and oxygen passing to the baby, thus inhibiting the baby's growth and causing the baby to be born too soon. Women can be affected through problems in their kidneys, liver, brain, and clotting system. Rest has been proposed as being beneficial for women at increased risk of pre窶親clampsia, including those with normal blood pressure. There are also possible adverse effects such as the potential for increasing the risk of blood clots in the legs, and the impact considerable periods of rest on women's lives and that of their families. The review of trials found two small studies, of not very good quality, and there were insufficient data to say what the potential benefits and harms might be. Further studies are needed, and in the meantime women will be guided by their own beliefs and reasoning, as well as those of their caregivers.
