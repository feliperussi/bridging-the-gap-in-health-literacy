Human chorionic gonadotrophin for threatened miscarriage
Threatened miscarriage is a term used when a woman who is less than 24 weeks pregnant with a live baby experiences bleeding. The mother has vaginal bleeding, with or without abdominal pain and cramps, but the cervix is closed. Miscarriage is a source of great physical and psychological distress and is very common. Causes include chromosomal abnormalities in the fetus, when the mother is older, has uterine or endocrine abnormalities or has polycystic ovarian syndrome. Human chorionic gonadotrophin (also called hCG) is a hormone produced by the placenta and is known to help maintain the pregnancy. Hence there has been much interest in the use of hCG for treating threatened miscarriage with the aim of preserving the pregnancy.This review of three trials (including 312 participants), one of which was of poor quality, found no evidence that hCG can be used as effective treatment for threatened miscarriage. There was no report on adverse effects of hCG on the mother or baby. More good‚Äêquality research is needed to study the impact of hCG on miscarriage.
