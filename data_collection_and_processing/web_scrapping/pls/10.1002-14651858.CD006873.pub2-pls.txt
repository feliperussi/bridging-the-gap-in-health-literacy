Interventions for prevention of post‐operative recurrence of Crohn's disease
Crohn's disease is a chronic illness where patients suffer from diarrhea, weight loss or stomach pain resulting from inflammation in the intestine. The illness often requires patients to undergo surgery in order to remove inflamed segments of intestine, but inflammation frequently returns at the site of surgery. This review examines the results of published studies which have looked at the effect of using medication following surgery for Crohn's disease as a mean of preventing the return (recurrence) of inflammation. Where possible, the results of studies were combined to compare the results of different treatments. A number of medications appeared to reduce the recurrence of inflammation, including metronidazole, mesalamine, azathioprine, 6‐mercaptopurine and infliximab. Given that some of these medications have significant side‐effects, the decision to use them requires a careful balancing of the risks and benefits for each individual patient
