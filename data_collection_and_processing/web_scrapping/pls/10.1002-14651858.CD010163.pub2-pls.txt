Microwave coagulation for liver metastases
Primary liver cancer and liver metastases from colorectal carcinoma are the two most common malignant tumours to affect the liver. The liver is second only to the lymph nodes as the most common site for metastatic disease. More than half of patients with metastatic liver disease will die from metastatic complications. Microwave coagulation involves placing an electrode into a lesion under ultrasound or computed tomography guidance. The microwave coagulator generates and transmits microwave energy to the electrode. Coagulative necrosis causes cellular death and destroys tissue in the treatment area, resulting in reduction of tumour size. One randomised clinical trial comparing microwave coagulation with conventional surgery (liver resection) is included in the review: 14 participants received microwave coagulation and 16 participants underwent conventional surgery. The trial was judged to have a high risk of systematic error (ie, overestimation of benefits and underestimation of harms). On the basis of one randomised trial, which did not describe allocation concealment or blinding, and which excluded from analysis 25% of participants after random assignment, evidence is insufficient to show whether microwave coagulation provides any significant benefit in terms of survival or recurrence compared with conventional surgery for participants with liver metastases from colorectal cancer. The number of adverse events, except for the requirement for blood transfusion, which was more common in the liver resection group, was similar in both groups. At present, microwave therapy cannot be recommended outside randomised clinical trials.
