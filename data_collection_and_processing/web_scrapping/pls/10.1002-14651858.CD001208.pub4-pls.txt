What is the effect of giving human albumin compared to saline to replace lost blood in critically ill or injured people 
Trauma, burns or surgery can cause people to lose large amounts of blood. Fluid replacement, giving fluids intravenously (into a vein), is used to help restore blood volume and hopefully reduce the risk of dying. Blood products (including human albumin), non‚Äêblood products or combinations can be used. This review of 38 trials found no evidence that albumin reduces the risk of dying. Albumin is very expensive, in which case it may be better to use cheaper alternatives such as saline for fluid replacement.
