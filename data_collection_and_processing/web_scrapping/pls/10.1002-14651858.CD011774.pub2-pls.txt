Comparing walk‐in clinics to physician offices and emergency rooms
What is the aim of this review? 
This review sought to compare the quality of care and patient satisfaction between walk‐in clinics and other medical practice settings. 
Key messages 
Walk‐in clinics are growing in popularity around the world, but it is unclear if the medical care provided by walk‐in clinics is comparable to that of physicians' offices or emergency rooms. 
What was studied in the review? 
Frequently offering extended hours, shorter wait times, and lower prices, retail clinics have become popular alternatives to traditional physician offices and emergency rooms for people with low acuity illnesses. Despite their growing popularity, walk‐in clinics have been controversial. Surveys have shown that some doctors in the UK, Canada, and Australia are concerned that walk‐in clinics may provide lower quality care than physician offices. In the US, prominent physician groups have voiced similar concerns. A systematic review of the research literature on the quality and patient satisfaction of walk‐in clinics as compared to physician offices and emergency rooms would give patients, practitioners, and health policymakers an objective understanding of this increasingly important but controversial healthcare resource.
