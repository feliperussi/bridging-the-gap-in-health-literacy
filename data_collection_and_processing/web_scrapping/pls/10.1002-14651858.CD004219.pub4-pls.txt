Percutaneous central venous catheters versus peripheral cannulae for delivery of parenteral nutrition in neonates 
Review question: In newborn infants receiving parenteral nutrition, does delivery into deep veins (via percutaneous central venous catheters) versus superficial veins (via peripheral cannulae) affect nutrition, growth and development, and adverse events including infection or skin damage? 
Background: Preterm or sick newborn infants are often fed with special nutrient solutions delivered directly into the veins. These solutions can be given into a superficial vein through standard, short (peripheral) cannulae or into a large deep vein via long (central) catheters. 
Study characteristics: We found six small randomised controlled trials (enrolling 549 infants in total) that addressed this question. The trials generally were of good methodological quality, although study findings may be biased by the inability to blind caregivers and investigators to the type of intervention provided. 
Key results: These trials provided only limited evidence on the effects of the interventions on nutrition. Analysis of data from three trials revealed that infants in the percutaneous central venous catheter group needed about four fewer catheters or cannulae during hospitalisation. Combined data from all trials showed no evidence of an effect on risk of bloodstream infection. 
Conclusions: Use of central venous catheters has been thought to increase the risk of bloodstream infection in newborn infants, but this review of randomised trials found no evidence that this was the case. More trials are needed to determine which method is better for improving nutrition and growth and development in newborn infants.
