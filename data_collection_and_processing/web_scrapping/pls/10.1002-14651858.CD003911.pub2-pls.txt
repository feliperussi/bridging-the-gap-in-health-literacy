Comparing the time taken to give paclitaxel (an anticancer drug) in advanced adenocarcinoma
Paclitaxel is derived from Yews (a type of tree), and can be used to treat for several cancers such as lung, womb, ovary and breast. It was initially given by a long infusion (injection) over 24 hours, with premedication to avoid any allergic reactions. It was also thought this method would be more active against tumours. Six randomised trials were included in this review, which found that short (three hour) infusions are more convenient and caused significantly fewer adverse (side) effects (i.e. decreased white blood cell counts, fever, infection or sore mouth). With short‚Äêinfusion paclitaxel there is no obvious loss of effectiveness when compared with longer infusions, although further clinical trials are needed to be sure of this.
