Alkylating agents for Waldenstrom's macroglobulinaemia
Waldenstrom's macroglobulinaemia (WM) is an uncommon B‐cell lymphoproliferative disorder characterised by bone marrow infiltration and production of monoclonal immunoglobulin. It is a kind of non‐Hodgkin's lymphoma which can lead to death. Alkylating agents are believed to be effective in treatment of Waldenstrom's macroglobulinaemia for alleviating symptoms and elongating survival time. The review authors found one randomised controlled trial with 92 participants that considered fludarabine was superior to the alkylating agents‐containing regimen for pretreated/relapsed patients with Waldenstrom's macroglobulinaemia.
