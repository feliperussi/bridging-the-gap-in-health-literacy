Interventions to control symptoms in Huntington's disease
Huntington's disease (HD) is an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disease. No curative therapy is currently available. We proposed to assess the effectiveness of interventions aimed at controlling the symptoms of HD and to analyse the methodological quality of the corresponding clinical trials. 22 trials were identified. The review of these trials comprising 1254 HD patients revealed that no intervention produced a robust conclusive symptomatic effect. Nevertheless, tetrabenazine was the drug for which better data exists supporting a beneficial effect in the treatment of chorea. There were no available data for the specific treatment of other clinical relevant problems associated with HD such as depression, irritability, apathy, cognitive impairment or psychosis.
