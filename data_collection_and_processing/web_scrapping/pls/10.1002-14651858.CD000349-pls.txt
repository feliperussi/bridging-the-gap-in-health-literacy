Professions allied to medicine, such as nurses, midwives and dietiticians, can effectively incorporate clinical guidelines to improve patient care 
The issuing of clinical guidelines to nurses, midwives, dieticians and other health‚Äêcare professionals allied to medicine may reduce variations in practice and improve patient care. This review found that, despite limited research, there is some evidence that guidelines can improve care and that professional roles can be substituted effectively, for instance a nurse can perform the function of a physician in certain circumstances. Such interventions offer the possibility of reduced costs but further research is needed in all areas of this topic.
