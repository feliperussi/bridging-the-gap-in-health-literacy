Comparison of different positions that a mother is placed in during caesarean section to improve outcomes for both the mother and her newborn 
Caesarean section is an operation that is performed on many pregnant woman to deliver the baby. During caesarean section the mother can be placed in a number of positions on the theatre table. Cushions and wedges can also be used to alter her position on the table and devices can also be used to displace the uterus laterally. This review aimed to assess the best position for the mother to be in during the surgery. 
The review authors identified 11 randomised controlled trials with a total of 857 women included and found that there was little difference from the trials to support or disprove the use of different positions, cushions, wedges or displacers. No studies assessed the impact of position on the risk of surgical complications. 
More studies are needed on this topic.
