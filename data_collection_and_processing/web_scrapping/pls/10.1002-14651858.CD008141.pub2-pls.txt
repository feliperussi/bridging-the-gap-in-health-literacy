Second‐generation antipsychotic drugs for obsessive compulsive disorder
This review found some trials comparing the effects of adding second‐generation antipsychotic drugs or placebo to antidepressants in obsessive compulsive disorder. There were only 11 trials on three second‐generation antipsychotic drugs (olanzapine, quetiapine and risperidone). While not much can be said about olanzapine, quetiapine and risperidone showed some efficacy benefit, but also adverse effects.
