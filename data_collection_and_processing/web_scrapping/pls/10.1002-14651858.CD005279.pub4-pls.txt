Ultrasound use for the placement of haemodialysis catheters
Insertion of haemodialysis catheters can be achieved either by using the anatomical landmarks for the veins into which they are inserted or using ultrasound guidance. It has been suggested that the use of ultrasound guidance reduces the immediate complications of haemodialysis catheter insertions such as pneumothorax or arterial puncture. We identified seven studies, enrolling 767 patients that compared haemodialysis catheter insertion using the traditional 'blind' landmark method and insertion using ultrasound imaging. The use of ultrasound imaging was found to be associated with significantly less risk of arterial puncture and haematomas and less time to insert the catheter as well as a higher success rate for inserting the catheter on the first attempt.
