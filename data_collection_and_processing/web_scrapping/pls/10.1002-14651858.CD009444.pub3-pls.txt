[Cholinesterase inhibitors for rarer dementia associated with neurological conditions]
There are various rarer dementias including Huntington's disease (HD), cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL), frontotemporal dementia (FTD), dementia in multiple sclerosis (MS) and progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP). A group of chemicals known as cholinesterase inhibitors are considered to be the first‚Äêline medicines for Alzheimer's disease and some other dementias. Cholinesterase inhibitors may also lead to clinical improvement for rarer dementias associated with neurological conditions. 
We analysed eight randomised controlled trials including 567 participants, which all used a placebo as a control. The methodological quality of most included trials was moderate. Some of the results were extracted from only one study, and there were no results for patients with PSP identified. Furthermore, some studies had small numbers of participants. The beneficial effect of cholinesterase inhibitors on cognitive function was only observed on a few cognitive function tests for patients with HD, CADASIL or MS. Cholinesterase inhibitors had no significant impact on improving cognitive level, activities of daily living and quality of life in patients with these conditions. For all conditions, compared to the treatment group, the placebo group experienced significantly less gastrointestinal side effects (nausea, diarrhoea and vomiting). There is no evidence for the efficacy of cholinesterase inhibitors for these conditions.
