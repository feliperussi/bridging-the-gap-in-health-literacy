Lifestyle modification strategies for managing obstructive sleep apnoea
Obstructive sleep apnoea happens when breathing is either stopped or reduced during sleep because of a narrowing or blockage of the upper airway (passage to the lungs). It causes loud snoring and occasional apnoea (stopping breathing). It can lead to daytime sleepiness and may cause, hypertension, stroke and road accidents. Lifestyle modification, especially weight loss, sleep hygiene and exercise, are often recommended. These could help by relieving pressure on the upper airway, and increasing muscle tone in the airway. However, the review found no trials to assess the effects of these strategies, and more research is needed.
