Catheter ablation would be an alternative to inhibit recurrence of paroxysmal or persistent atrial fibrillation 
Atrial fibrillation is a common arrhythmic disease where the heart beats rapidly and irregularly. This can occur for separate brief or long episodes (paroxysmal) or it may become continuous (persistent). This review's aim was to establish whether catheter ablation was better than medical therapies to control heart rate or rhythm for paroxysmal and persistent AF. If catheter ablations were found to be better, the aim was to determine which ablation method was superior to the other. In catheter ablation, a thin tube is passed through a vein to the heart through which instruments can target the misfiring parts of the tissue that control the hearts rhythm. A total of thirty two randomised controlled trials (RCTs) were included in this review. Catheter ablation may be superior to medical treatment but the data is inconclusive in inhibiting recurrence of AF. Embolic complications were commonly caused by catheter ablation. Although these complications and death rate of catheter ablation were similar to that of medical therapies, catheter ablation may cause adverse events of radiation exploration. We were also unable to determine which catheter ablation technique was the best as most RCTs were small scale. Evidence from RCTs cannot yet support catheter ablation as the first line of treatment for paroxysmal and persistent AF.
