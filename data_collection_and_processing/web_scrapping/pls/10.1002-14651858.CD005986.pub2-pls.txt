Fish oil for the treatment of active ulcerative colitis
Ulcerative colitis is an inflammation of the large intestine that causes diarrhea, abdominal pain, rectal bleeding and fever. Since there is no cure for the disease the aim of treatment is to cause a reduction of the unpleasant and painful signs and symptoms. Current, proven, treatment options for active ulcerative colitis include corticosteroids, aminosalicylates, immunosuppressive and biological agents. However, these drugs can cause side effects. New treatments which cause fewer side effects are being sought. Fish oil, which is rich in omega‐3 fatty acids may reduce inflammation and decrease the need for anti‐inflammatory drugs in patients with ulcerative colitis. Six studies looking at the effects of fish oil in active ulcerative colitis were included in the review. Study quality was mostly poor. One small study showed a positive benefit for the treatment of active ulcerative colitis. However, this result should be interpreted with caution due to small study size and poor study quality. Due to limited data there is not enough information available to determine whether fish oil treatment is effective for induction of remission in ulcerative colitis.
