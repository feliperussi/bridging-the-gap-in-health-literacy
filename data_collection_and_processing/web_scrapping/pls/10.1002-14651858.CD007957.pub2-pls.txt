Low‐fat diets for acquired hypercholesterolaemia
There is currently no firm evidence of the long‐term (at least six months) effects of low‐fat diets for otherwise healthy people with acquired, that is not familial hypercholesterolaemia (high cholesterol levels in the blood). Various low‐fat diets have been investigated in people with long‐term illnesses, however, a high quality trial of at least six months duration in otherwise healthy people with high blood cholesterol is needed.
