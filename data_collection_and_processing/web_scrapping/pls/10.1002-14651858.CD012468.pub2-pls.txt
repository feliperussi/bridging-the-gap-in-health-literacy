Clonidine for neonates receiving mechanical ventilation
Review question: Does clonidine reduce mortality and the duration of mechanical ventilation in term and preterm newborn infants? 
Background: Although routine pharmacologic sedation or analgesia during mechanical ventilation in preterm neonates is not recommended, its use in clinical practice remains common. Clonidine may be used as an adjunctive (or alternative) sedative agent alongside other opioids and benzodiazepines. This review reported and critically analyzed available evidence on the effectiveness of clonidine in term and preterm newborn infants on a ventilator. 
Study characteristics: In medical literature searches completed to January 2017, we identified and included one trial with 112 newborns comparing clonidine with placebo. 
Study funding resources: We did not identify funding by industry for the included trial. 
Results: Clonidine did not reduce death, duration of mechanical ventilation, or duration of stay in the intensive care unit. Sedation and pain scale values were lower among newborns receiving clonidine. 
Conclusions: Owing to the small number of newborns included in the single included trial, we are uncertain as to whether clonidine is effective or safe in providing analgesia and sedation for mechanically ventilated neonates.
