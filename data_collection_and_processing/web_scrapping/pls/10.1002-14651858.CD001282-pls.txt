The effect of beclomethasone on height in children
During an asthma attack, the airways (passages to the lungs) narrow from swelling (inflammation) and muscle spasm. This causes breathing problems, wheezing and coughing. Inhaled steroids are used to reduce the swelling to the airways, but they may also stunt growth in children. The review of trials found that the inhaled steroid, beclomethasone causes an average decrease in growth of about one and a half centimetres a year. However, it is not known whether there is any catch‚Äêup growth once the treatment is stopped. More research is needed.
