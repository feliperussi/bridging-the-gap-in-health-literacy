Hyperbaric oxygen as an additional treatment for malignant otitis externa
Malignant otitis externa is an uncommon, although potentially fatal, infection of the external ear canal including the surrounding soft tissue and bone. It is mainly found in the elderly or diabetics. Treatments include antibiotics, stringent diabetes control, the repeated removal of dead tissue and surgical management. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy is increasingly being used in addition to these treatments where facilities exist. Hyperbaric oxygen treatment involves placing the patient in a compression chamber, increasing the environmental pressure within the chamber and administering 100% oxygen for respiration. 
The review found no trials to demonstrate that the addition of hyperbaric oxygen therapy offers a better outcome than the treatments alone. Further research is required.
