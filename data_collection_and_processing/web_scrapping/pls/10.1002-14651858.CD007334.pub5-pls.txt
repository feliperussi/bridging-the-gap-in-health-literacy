Surgery versus endoscopic therapies for early oesophageal cancer in Barrett's oesophagus
This Cochrane review has indicated that there are no randomised controlled trials to compare management options in this vital area, therefore trials should be undertaken as a matter of urgency. Current use of endotherapies in the care of patients with early cancer or high‐grade dysplasia of Barrett's oesophagus should be at the recommendation of the multi‐disciplinary team involved in individual care. Properly conducted randomised controlled trials comparing surgery with endotherapies should be conducted before any conclusions can be drawn.
