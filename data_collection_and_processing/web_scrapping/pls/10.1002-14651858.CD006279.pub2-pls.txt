Controlled studies for treatment of dysarthia associated with acquired brain injury in childhood urgently required 
Dysarthria is a disorder of speech production that can make it harder for people to be understood by others.  Dysarthria is a common and often chronic outcome associated with brain injury suffered in childhood (also known as paediatric acquired brain injury (ABI) ). 
This research examines the efficacy of treatment for dysarthria in children following ABI. 
Although this research reports that  positive gains have been reported from a case‐based study of a child with dysarthria following ABI (specifically with traumatic brain injury), there are currently too few studies performed in this area to draw any conclusions about the efficacy of treatment for dysarthria in children and teenagers. This review therefore calls for Speech Language Pathologists/Speech Language Therapists (SLPs/SLTs) working in this area to perform studies of the natural history and treatment efficacy of this group.
