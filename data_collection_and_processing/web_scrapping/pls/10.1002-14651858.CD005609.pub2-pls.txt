Are interventions to improve clinical incidence reporting effective?
A clinical incident is "any occurrence which is not consistent with the routine care of the patient or the routine operation of a healthcare institution". To prevent clinical incidents, it is important to promote a safety culture among clinicians, healthcare professionals and patients, but also to identify and learn more from errors in order to improve the care process and the organisational support within healthcare institutions. Therefore, it is important to review the effectiveness of incident reporting systems aimed at increasing the number of clinical incident reported by health professionals. 
We searched the scientific literature for studies that evaluated the effectiveness of interventions to increase clinical incident reporting in healthcare. We found four studies using different types of designs and which had several methodological shortcomings. The studies used different interventions and their results are heterogeneous: in two studies there was a significant increase in the reporting rate of clinical incidents. 
The results of this review show that rigorous evidence to demonstrate the effectiveness of this type of intervention is lacking, so it is not possible to draw conclusions for clinical practice.
