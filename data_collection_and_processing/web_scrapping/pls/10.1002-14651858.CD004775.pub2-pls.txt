Mass media campaigns designed to raise awareness of HIV and AIDS have shown immediate and significant effects in the promotion of voluntary counseling and testing for HIV. 
According to UNAIDS, 42 million people in the world have HIV infection. Notably, the majority of new infections are preventable and are spread through unsafe sex. Voluntary counseling and testing (VCT) can lead to the practice of safe sexual behaviors and increased condom use, thus preventing spread of the disease. 
While mass media campaigns have shown an immediate and significant overall effect on VCT, no significant long‚Äêterm effect was demonstrated. This may have been due to the short duration of the campaigns. Further research is needed to identify the impact of mass media campaigns, their cost effectiveness, and types of campaigns and message characteristics. In addition, more studies are needed to explore new media strategies for the long term.
