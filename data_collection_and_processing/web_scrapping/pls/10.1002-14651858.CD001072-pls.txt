Continuous positive airway pressure versus theophylline for apnea in preterm infants
Theophylline may be more helpful in preventing problems for preterm babies with apnea than CPAP (blowing air) through a mask. Apnea is common in preterm babies (born before 37 weeks). It is a pause in breathing of more than 20 seconds, or less than 20 seconds but with a reduced heart rate and cyanosis (a blue tinge to the skin colour indicating not enough oxygen). Resuscitation may be needed. Drugs such as theophylline can be used to stimulate breathing or continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) which helps breathing by blowing air into the baby through a mask or tube. The review of trials found theophylline is more effective than mask CPAP for preterm infants with apnea. More research is needed.
