The benefit of artificial and bioartificial liver support systems looks promising
Liver failure may develop without pre‐existing liver disease (acute liver failure) or with pre‐existing liver disease (acute‐on‐chronic liver failure). Both disorders are serious and may lead to death. Artificial and bioartificial support systems may 'bridge' patients to liver transplantation or spontaneous recovery. Evidence from twelve small randomised trials were combined. Most trials had unclear methodologic quality. Overall, support systems did not appear to affect mortality or bridging to transplantation, but had a beneficial effect on hepatic encephalopathy. The risk of adverse events could not be established. Further evidence is needed before support systems can be recommended for routine use.
