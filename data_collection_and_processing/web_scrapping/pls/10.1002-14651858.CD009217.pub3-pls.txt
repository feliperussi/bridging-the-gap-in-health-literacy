Reduced dietary salt for the prevention of cardiovascular disease
Cardiovascular disease includes heart attacks and strokes and is a major cause of premature death and disability. This is an update of a review first published in 2011. This review sets out to assess whether intensive support and encouragement to cut down on salt in foods, and substituting low‐sodium salt, reduces the risk of death or cardiovascular disease. This update includes two new studies and eliminates one problematic study, giving a total of eight trials with 7284 participants. 
Dietary advice and salt substitution did reduce the amount of salt eaten, which led to a small reduction in blood pressure by six months. There was weak evidence of benefit for cardiovascular events, but these findings were inconclusive and were driven by a single trial among retirement home residents, which reduced salt intake in the kitchens of the homes. 
The findings of our review do not mean that advising people to reduce salt should be stopped. However, additional measures ‐ reducing the amount of hidden salt in processed foods, for example – will make it much easier for people to achieve a lower salt diet. Overall many of the trials failed to report sufficient detail to assess their potential risk of bias. Further evidence of the effects of different ways of reducing dietary salt on clinical events is needed from experimental and observational studies to underpin public health policies.
