To assess whether metered dose inhalers or nebulizers are better for delivering inhaled drugs to mechanically ventilated patients 
Acute respiratory failure is common in patients with long term breathing problems who have been admitted to hospital for sudden worsening of their symptoms. A large number of these patients require admission to a critical care unit, where a machine can help them to breathe (mechanical ventilation). In addition, medicines are given to help ease breathing problems by opening up the airways of the lungs (bronchodilator drugs). Bronchodilator drugs relax the muscles in the lungs allowing the airways to widen so that more air passes through, making breathing easier. These drugs are mostly given through inhalation, with specially adapted nebulizers and metered dose inhalers (MDIs) being available for patients who are being mechanically ventilated. Which of these delivery methods is more effective is as yet unclear. We carried out a systematic review of the literature by searching five key databases and asking relevant manufacturers for high quality published or unpublished material which compared the effectiveness of these two delivery methods, nebulizers and MDIs. 
This Cochrane systematic review included three trials with 46 patients in total (two trials with 18 patients, one trial with 10 patients), and showed that there is insufficient valid research evidence to recommend either delivery method. There is a clear need for more research into which delivery method is more effective.
