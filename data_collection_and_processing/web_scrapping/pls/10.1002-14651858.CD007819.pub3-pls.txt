Use of antibacterial substances in resin‐based fillings to prevent further tooth decay (next to the filling) developing after treatment 
Review question 
The main question addressed by this review is how effective the use of antibacterial agents in composite (resin‐based, tooth‐coloured) fillings might be in preventing the development of further decay either underneath or next to the filling (secondary caries). 
Background 
When tooth decay (caries) has caused a cavity in a tooth a range of materials can be used as fillings. These include resin composite, glass ionomer cement, amalgam and compomers. Tooth decay that may develop next to or underneath, a filling at a later stage is a common concern in dental practice and may reduce the life span of these fillings. It is thought that including a substance that kills and prevents the growth of bacterial (also known as an antibacterial agent) in some dental fillings, for example resin composites, could help prevent the development of this secondary caries. 
Study characteristics 
The Cochrane Oral Health Group carried out this review of existing studies and the evidence is current up to 23 July 2013. 
The review authors have not found any trials to support or disprove the effectiveness of antibacterial agents incorporated into fillings to prevent further tooth decay. 
Key results 
No trials were found that were suitable for inclusion in this review.
Quality of the evidence 
Currently there is no evidence to support using antibacterial agents in fillings.
