Medically assisted hydration to assist palliative care patients
Background 
It is common for palliative care patients to have reduced fluid intake during their illness. Management of this condition includes discussion with the patient, family and staff involved, and may include the provision of fluids with medical assistance. This can be performed using a small plastic tube inserted into a vein or under the skin, or via a tube inserted into the stomach. It is unknown whether this treatment helps people to feel better or live longer. 
Study characteristics 
We searched the international literature for randomised controlled trials looking at the effects of medically assisted hydration in adults receiving palliative care. Randomised controlled trials allocate patients to one of two or more treatment groups in a random manner and provide the most accurate information on the best treatment. We conducted the searches in April 2013 and March 2014. 
Key results and quality of evidence 
We found only six studies looking at this issue. The studies did not show a significant benefit in the use of medically assisted hydration in palliative care patients; however, there are insufficient good‚Äêquality studies to make any definitive recommendations. . As a result, it is not possible to define the benefits and harms of this treatment clearly.
