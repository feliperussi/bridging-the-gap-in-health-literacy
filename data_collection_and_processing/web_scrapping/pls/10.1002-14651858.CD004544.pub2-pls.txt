Banding ligation versus beta‐blockers for primary prevention in oesophageal varices in adults 
Non‐selective beta‐blockers are used as a first‐line treatment for primary prevention in patients with medium‐ to high‐risk oesophageal varices. However, the effect of non‐selective beta‐blockers on mortality is debated and many patients experience adverse events. This review includes 19 randomised trials on banding ligation versus beta‐blockers for patients with high‐risk oesophageal varices and no history of bleeding. Bias control was unclear in most trials. There was no difference in mortality among the patients randomised to banding ligation compared with beta‐blockers. The trials with adequate bias control based on the assessment of randomisation methods found no difference in bleeding rates. The trials with unclear randomisation methods found that banding ligation reduced bleeding. The effect of banding ligation was associated with the duration of follow‐up and publication status of the trials. The results of trials with less than 20 months of follow‐up found a better effect of banding ligation compared to trials with longer follow‐up. Trials published in abstract form were more positive towards the effect of banding ligation than trials published as full paper articles. The combined evidence suggests that banding ligation and beta‐blockers may be used as primary prophylaxis in oesophageal varices in adult patients. Additional evidence from trials with adequate bias control and sufficient follow‐up is still needed to determine long‐term effects.
