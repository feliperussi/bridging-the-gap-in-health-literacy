Tocolytics for preterm premature rupture of membranes
Preterm premature rupture of membranes (PPROM) accounts for one‐third of preterm births. Infants who are born before 37 weeks may suffer from problems related to prematurity, including death. Medications that aim to stop labor are often given in an attempt to prevent preterm birth. It is unclear whether these medications should be used in women with PPROM. This review of eight studies (involving 408 women) found that these medications do not effect perinatal death, but do increase latency and may increase maternal (e.g., chorioamnionitis) and neonatal morbidity (e.g., five‐minute Apgar of less than seven and increased need for ventilation of the neonate).
