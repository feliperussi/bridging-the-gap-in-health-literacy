Cephalic version by postural management for breech presentation
There is currently not enough evidence for encouraging the mother to adopt different postures during pregnancy in order to change a breech baby's position in the womb. 
Babies born in the breech position (bottom first) are more likely to have problems during birth than babies born head first (cephalic). There are different ways of trying to encourage the baby to turn so that he/she can be born head first. Some of these involve the mother adopting different postures. This review of six trials, involving 417 women, found too little evidence to support the use of certain postures to change the baby's position in pregnancy to head down. Further research is required.
