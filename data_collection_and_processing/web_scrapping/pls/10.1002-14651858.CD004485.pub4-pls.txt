Adhesives for fixed orthodontic bands
There is insufficient evidence to determine the most effective adhesive for attaching orthodontic bands to molar teeth in patients with full arch fixed orthodontic appliances. Orthodontic treatment involves using fixed or removable appliances (braces) on teeth to correct their position. It has been shown that the quality of treatment result obtained with fixed dental appliances is much better than with removable appliances. The success of a fixed dental appliance depends on the metal attachments (brackets and bands) being securely attached to the teeth so that they do not become loose during treatment. Brackets are usually attached to teeth other than molars, where bands (metal rings that go round the teeth) are more commonly used. There is insufficient evidence with regard to the most effective adhesive for attaching orthodontic bands to molar teeth.
