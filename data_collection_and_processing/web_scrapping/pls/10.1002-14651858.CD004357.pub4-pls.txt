Monosodium glutamate (MSG) avoidance for chronic asthma in adults and children
Monosodium glutamate (MSG) is used as a flavour enhancer and has been implicated in "Chinese Restaurant Syndrome", causing tightness, burning or numbness in the face, neck and upper chest (although there is no evidence to prove this syndrome). It has also been proposed that asthmatics may react badly to MSG. In two randomised controlled trials (RCTs), involving 24 adult asthmatics, there was no evidence that MSG worsened asthma when compared to control ingestion. Further RCTs are needed.
