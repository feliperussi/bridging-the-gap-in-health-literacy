Antibiotics for preventing recurrent sore throat
Background 
Recurrent sore throat is an inflammation of the throat occurring three or more times per year. Sore throat has many causes, including bacteria, viruses, fungi (uncommonly) and non‐infective causes. It causes throat pain, redness, swelling, swollen lymph nodes and symptoms of other accompanying respiratory infections. Antibiotics are sometimes used to prevent recurrent sore throat on the basis that sore throats can be caused by bacteria. However, frequent use of antibiotics has been linked to the development of antibiotic resistance. We looked for studies (randomised controlled trials) that investigated the effectiveness of antibiotics for preventing recurrent sore throat in adults and children. 
Study characteristics 
Despite a comprehensive search in June 2015, we were unable to identify any studies that met the inclusion criteria for this review. 
Key results 
No trials could be included in this review. We therefore conclude that there is insufficient evidence to determine the effectiveness of antibiotics for preventing recurrent sore throat and this finding must be balanced against the known adverse effects and cost of antibiotic therapy when considering antibiotics for this purpose. We have identified a need for high quality randomised controlled trials that compare the effects of antibiotics versus placebo in adults and children with pre‐existing recurrent sore throat on the following outcomes: incidence of sore throat recurrence, adverse effects, days off work and absence from school, and the incidence of complications.
