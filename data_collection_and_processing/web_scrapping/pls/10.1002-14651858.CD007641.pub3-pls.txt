Self‐management education for cystic fibrosis
We set out to review the effects of self‐management education for cystic fibrosis on a range of health outcomes in individuals of all ages with cystic fibrosis and their caregivers. Our search for available evidence identified four trials, and all four compared a form of self‐management education to standard treatment. The precise focus of self management differed between trials and included a training programme for managing cystic fibrosis, education on chest treatments, education on nutrition specific to cystic fibrosis, and education on general and disease‐specific nutrition. Self‐management education had no positive effects on lung function, weight, or intake of fatty food. There is some evidence to suggest that self‐management education improves knowledge about cystic fibrosis and its management in patients with this condition and some self‐management behaviours in patients and caregivers. However, due to the small number of trials in this review, and because of concerns about the quality of these trials, we are unable to reach any firm conclusions about the effects of self‐management education for cystic fibrosis. We recommend that further trials are conducted to evaluate the effects of self‐management education interventions.
