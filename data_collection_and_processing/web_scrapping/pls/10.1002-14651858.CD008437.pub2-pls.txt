Respiratory function monitoring to reduce mortality and morbidity in newborn infants receiving resuscitation 
When resuscitating a newborn baby, the team attending to the baby uses clinical judgement to determine how much assisted breathing is required during resuscitation. However, this approach is frequently inadequate. A respiratory function monitor measures the amount of air going into the babies lung. The clinical team can use this information to deliver better care to a newborn baby when assisted breathing alone is required. We were unable to identify any studies that compared the clinical judgement of assisted breathing with clinical judgement of assisted breathing plus the additional use of a respiratory function monitor to reduce mortality and morbidity in newborn infants receiving resuscitation.
