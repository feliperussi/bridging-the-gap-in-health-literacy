The use of drugs to slow or stop progression of arthritis related to cystic fibrosis
Arthritis is not a common complication of cystic fibrosis, but it can cause major problems when it does occur. There are two distinct types of arthritis in cystic fibrosis: cystic fibrosis‐related arthropathy and hypertrophic pulmonary osteoarthropathy. The best treatment for these types of arthritis is not clear because of cystic fibrosis and its intense treatment. Some drugs can treat the symptoms of arthritis by reducing inflammation of the joints and relieving pain, but only disease modifying anti‐rheumatic drugs can stop or slow progression of the disease. We planned to report evidence from clinical trials which compared different disease‐modifying drugs compared with placebo (or dummy treatment), with each other or with no treatment. However, we were disappointed that we could not find any completed randomised controlled trials of these treatments or any evidence from non‐randomised controlled trials. We suggest that there should be a randomised controlled trial to look at the effects and the safety of using disease modifying anti‐rheumatic drugs to slow or stop the progression of arthritis in people with cystic fibrosis.
