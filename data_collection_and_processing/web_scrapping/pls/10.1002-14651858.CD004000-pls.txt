Intravenous immunoglobulin for the treatment of Kawasaki disease in children
Good evidence that intravenous immunoglobulin treatment within the first 10 days of symptoms reduces coronary artery abnormalities (heart damage) in children with Kawasaki disease. Kawasaki disease is a disease that primarily affects children under five years old. The cause of Kawasaki disease is not known. Its symptoms are persistent fever, red eyes and lips, strawberry tongue, rash and swollen lymph nodes. If not detected and treated immediately, Kawasaki disease can result in heart damage and occasionally death. Intravenous immunoglobulin involves injecting antibodies purified from donated blood. The review of trials found that intravenous immunoglobulin given within the first 10 days of the disease reduces the risk of damage to the coronary arteries of the heart in children, without serious adverse effects.
