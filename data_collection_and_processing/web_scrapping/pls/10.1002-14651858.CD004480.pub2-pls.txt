Evidence on beneficial or harmful effects of bicyclol for chronic hepatitis C is not found 
Bicyclol is a novel synthetic 'anti‐hepatitis' drug, used primarily in China for patients with chronic hepatitis B. No well‐designed randomised clinical trials were found evaluating the benefits or possible harms of bicyclol for patients with chronic hepatitis B. Clinicians should be aware of this lack of evidence for bicyclol.
