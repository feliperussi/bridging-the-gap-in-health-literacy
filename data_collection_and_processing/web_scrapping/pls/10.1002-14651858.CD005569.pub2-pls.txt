Chuanxiong‐type preparations for acute ischemic stroke
Stroke is a common disorder. It is due either to blockage of an artery in the brain or to bleeding in the brain. Chuanxiong is a Traditional Chinese Medicine. It is widely used in China for the treatment of patients with stroke. Two poor quality trials involving 161 participants were included in this review. The authors did not find any strong evidence about its effects. Well‐designed and conducted trials will be needed to provide reliable evidence to show whether this intervention does more good than harm.
