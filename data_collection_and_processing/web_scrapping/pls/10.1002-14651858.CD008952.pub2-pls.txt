Pain management for rheumatoid arthritis with cardiovascular or renal comorbidity
This summary of a Cochrane review presents what we know from research about the safety of using pain‐relieving drugs in people with rheumatoid arthritis who also have either heart or kidney disease, or both. 
What is rheumatoid arthritis and what is pain management? 
When you have rheumatoid arthritis, your immune system, which normally fights infection, inflames the lining of your joints making them painful, stiff and swollen. People with rheumatoid arthritis often need to use painkillers and anti‐inflammatories such as paracetamol or ibuprofen to control this pain and inflammation. 
Pain can be managed with several drugs including non‐steroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), (e.g. ibuprofen, diclofenac and COX‐2s (e.g. celecoxib)); opioids and opioid‐like drugs (e.g. tramadol, morphine and others), paracetamol (also known as acetaminophen), and neuromodulators (including anti‐depressants, anti‐convulsants, and muscle relaxants). 
The review shows that in people with rheumatoid arthritis and heart or kidney problems: 
We do not have precise information about side effects and complications because no studies were found that looked at side effects of pain drugs in these people. There are well documented side effects with many commonly used pain medications such as stomach, kidney and heart problems associated with NSAID use, and gastrointestinal problems associated with the use of opioids.
