Early versus late discontinuation of oxygen in preterm or low birth weight infants
Not enough evidence to show the benefits or adverse effects of early oxygen weaning in preterm or low birthweight babies. Babies born either prematurely (before 37 weeks) or with a low birthweight often have breathing problems and need extra oxygen. Oxygen supplementation has provided many benefits for these babies and the ability to measure oxygen levels accurately can help reduce adverse effects. The correct time to wean babies off oxygen supplementation has been unclear but is usually measured by their age, weight gain and breathing ability. The review did not find enough evidence from trials to show the benefits or adverse effects of early oxygen weaning in preterm or low birth weight babies. More research is needed.
