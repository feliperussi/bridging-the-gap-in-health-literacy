Early volume expansion for prevention of morbidity and mortality in very preterm infants
Early volume expansion for very preterm babies has not been shown to improve their outcomes but more research is needed. Low blood pressure and blood flow have been linked to brain injury in preterm babies. They can also cause permanent injury to other organs and developmental problems. One way of trying to increase the blood pressure and flow of blood is to increase the amount of fluid in the blood stream (volume expansion). This can be done with products such as albumin (a protein) and salt solutions. The review of evidence from trials found that volume expansion has not been shown to improve outcomes for preterm babies. More research is needed.
