Exercise and mobilisation interventions for carpal tunnel syndrome
Carpal tunnel syndrome is a common condition where one of two main nerves in the wrist is compressed, resulting in pain to the hand, wrist and sometimes arm, numbness and tingling in the thumb, index and long finger. In advanced cases the muscles of the hand can become weak. The condition affects approximately three per cent of the population, more commonly women. While carpal tunnel syndrome can be treated with surgery, people with mild to moderate symptoms are sometimes offered non‐surgical interventions such as exercises or mobilisation. Based on the 16 studies identified, there is limited and very low quality evidence of benefit for all of a diverse collection of exercise and mobilisation interventions for improving symptoms, functional ability (for example hand grip strength), quality of life, and neurophysiologic parameters, and for minimising adverse effects and the need for surgery in people with carpal tunnel syndrome. More research is needed to investigate the effectiveness of exercises and mobilisation for people with carpal tunnel syndrome, especially the sustainability and long‐term effects of this treatment.
