Early Intervention for psychosis
Schizophrenia typically begins in young adulthood and may lead to disability that lasts a lifetime. The onset of psychosis is usually preceded by a period of non‐psychotic symptoms, known as prodromal symptoms. The symptoms of full‐blown schizophrenia include hallucinations, delusions, disordered thinking and emotional withdrawal. There is some evidence that a delay in receiving adequate treatment reduces the chances or the extent of recovery. 
In broad terms, early intervention has two objectives: the first is to prevent the onset of schizophrenia in people with prodromal symptoms; the second is to provide effective treatment to people in the early stages of schizophrenia, with the goal of reducing the ultimate severity of the illness. Early intervention services are now widespread in America, Europe and Australia. 
We sought to review all trials that involved early intervention for people with prodromal symptoms, or a first episode of psychosis. We identified 18 studies, most were underpowered and at present we have insufficient data to draw any definitive conclusions, although further trials are expected.
