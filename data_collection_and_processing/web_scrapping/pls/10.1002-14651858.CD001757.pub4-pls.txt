Surgery for faecal incontinence in adults
Faecal incontinence (the inability to control the release of stool) can be debilitating, and is a common reason for older people to need nursing home care. It can happen for many reasons including malformations of the rectum (lower part of the intestine) or anus, neurological (nerve) diseases, or damage during childbirth or surgery. Treatments include pelvic floor muscle training, electrical stimulation, drugs and surgery. Surgery is used in selected groups of people, particularly (but not exclusively) when the defects in the muscles surrounding the anal canal can be corrected mechanically. The review found that there is still not enough evidence on which to judge whether one type of surgical operation was better or worse than another one, or better than different types of treatment for faecal incontinence. However, many of the techniques originally reviewed are now no longer in general use.
