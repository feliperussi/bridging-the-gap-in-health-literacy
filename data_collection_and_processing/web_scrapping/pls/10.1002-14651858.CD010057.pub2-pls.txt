Citrate salts for preventing and treating calcium containing kidney stones in adults
Kidney stones are one of the most common disorders of the urinary tract. They typically affect people aged 40 to 60 years of age and are twice as common in men than women although recent data suggest the risks are more equal. Calcium stones are the most common type of kidney stone and occur in two major forms: calcium oxalate and calcium phosphate. Kidney stones can cause severe abdominal pain and may require urgent treatment; they are one of the main causes of unscheduled admissions in urological practice. 
Following treatment even first time stone formers have a risk for recurrence which increased with each subsequent stone. This increased risk of recurrence of stones is mainly attributed to altered composition of urine i.e. low citrate levels. Various prevention strategies including increased fluid intake and oral citrate supplements have been tried to modify the chemical composition of the urine. Citrate therapy is believed to stop crystals from growing into stones. The uncertainty of the true benefit of citrate therapy prompted this review. 
We included seven studies (477 participants) in this review. Citrate salts significantly reduce stone size, prevent new stone formation, and results in stone size stability. People experienced more side effects, such as gastrointestinal disturbance, when using citrate salts than when using placebo, however the need for retreatment for stone removal was significantly less with citrate therapy.
