Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) for phantom pain and stump pain following amputation in adults 
Pain may present in a body part that has been amputated (phantom pain) or at the site of amputation (stump pain), or both. Phantom pain and stump pain are complex conditions and affect up to 80% of amputees.The underlying causes are not fully understood. Drug therapy is the most common treatment yet the condition remains poorly managed. The need for non‐drug interventions has been recognised and TENS may have an important role to play. 
TENS is an inexpensive, safe and easy to use analgesic technique. TENS is administered using a battery‐powered portable device, which generates electrical currents that are delivered to the skin to activate underlying nerves. 
An updated search of various databases in March 2015 found no studies that met the eligibility criteria for inclusion in this review. 
It was not possible to judge the effectiveness of TENS for phantom pain and stump pain. 
It was not possible to assess the risk of harm from using TENS for phantom pain and stump pain. 
A large, multicentre randomised controlled trial of TENS for phantom pain and stump pain is needed.
