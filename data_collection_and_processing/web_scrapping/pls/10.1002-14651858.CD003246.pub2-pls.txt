Oxytocin for induction of labour
Sometimes it is necessary to bring on labour artificially, because of safety concerns either for the pregnant woman or her baby. Oxytocin is the most common drug used to induce labour and has been used either alone, with other drugs or after artificial rupture of the membranes. In this review we looked at the use of oxytocin alone for inducing labour. The review included 61 studies with more than12,000 women. Overall, oxytocin seems to be a safe method of inducing labour. Compared to waiting to see whether labour starts naturally (expectant management), giving oxytocin led to more women having their babies within 24 hours, but more women needed an epidural for pain relief. Most of the studies recruited women with ruptured membranes and the number of babies with an infection was lower with oxytocin compared with expectant management. 
A comparison of oxytocin with other drugs to induce labour (vaginal or intracervical prostaglandins) showed that women were more likely to have their babies within 24 hours with prostaglandin. Fewer women had epidurals with prostaglandin. Side effects for the mother were similar in the two groups.
