Yoga as an additional treatment option for people with asthma
Background 
Asthma is a common chronic disease that affects about 300 million people worldwide. Yoga, the popularity of which has expanded globally, has the potential to relieve some asthma‐related problems. However, the effects of yoga for asthma need to be confirmed due to the inconsistent findings of existing studies. 
Study characteristics 
We reviewed 15 studies that compared the effects of yoga with usual treatment or a 'sham' yoga in 1048 participants. 
Results 
We found that yoga probably improves quality of life and asthma symptoms to some extent. However, our confidence in the results is low as most of the studies were flawed in various ways. The effects of yoga on lung function were inconsistent, and we found a small amount of evidence indicating that yoga can reduce medication usage. Information on unwanted side effects was very limited; more studies are needed to assess this. High‐quality studies involving large numbers of participants are required for us to be able to draw a firm conclusion about the effects of yoga for asthma.
