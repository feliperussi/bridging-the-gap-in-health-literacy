Antibiotics at the time of removal of a central line to reduce complications in newborn infants 
Review question 
Does giving antibiotics at the time of removal of a central line reduce death and other serious complications in newborn infants? 
Background 
Central lines are specialised catheters that are inserted into a vein so that the tip of the catheter lies in the central veins close to the heart. Central lines are necessary to provide life‚Äêsaving medications and nutrition to sick babies. However, their use is sometimes associated with complications, and infection is one of the most common and important of these. It has been noted in some studies that infections occur as central lines are being removed, and it is hypothesised that giving antibiotics as the central line is removed may help prevent infection and associated complications. 
Study characteristics 
We found only one small trial of low quality that considered antibiotics at the time of removal of a central line. 
Key results 
Researchers found no significant differences in complication rates between babies who were and were not given antibiotics. 
Conclusion 
At present, review authors have not found enough evidence to recommend giving antibiotics at the time of removal of a central line to prevent complications in newborn babies.
