Low‐concentration capsaicin applied to the skin for chronic neuropathic pain in adults
Neuropathic pain is caused by damage to nerves, either from injury or disease. Pain is described as chronic if it has been experienced on most days for at least three months. It is unlikely that topical (rubbed on the skin), low‐concentration (< 1%) capsaicin provides any useful pain relief in neuropathic pain conditions. It is known to cause local skin irritation such as burning and stinging.
