Alternative magnesium sulphate regimens for women with pre‐eclampsia and eclampsia
This review found that not enough research has been carried out to show what is the best dose for magnesium sulphate for women with pre‐eclampsia or eclampsia, and how best to give it. 
Pre‐eclampsia (or toxaemia) is a disorder that is usually associated with raised blood pressure (hypertension) and protein in the urine. It can occur at any time during the second half of pregnancy or in the first few weeks after delivery. Magnesium sulphate is effective in preventing eclampsia (a fit or seizure) in women who have pre‐eclampsia, and for treating women who experience an eclamptic convulsion. The review authors included six trials (866 women). Two of the trials (451 women) recruited women with eclampsia and four trials (415 women) recruited women with pre‐eclampsia. These randomised trials are too small to give reliable guidance on the advantages or disadvantages of the different regimens used. The included studies were carried out in both high‐income and low‐income countries.
