Telephone follow‐up by a hospital‐based health professional after hospital discharge
Many patients encounter a variety of problems in the first weeks after they have been discharged from hospital to home. Telephone follow‐up, initiated by hospital‐based health professionals, is considered to be a good means of exchanging information, providing health education and advice, managing symptoms, recognising complications early and giving reassurance to patients after discharge. Some research has shown that telephone follow‐up is feasible, and that patients appreciate such calls. However, until now it was not clear whether telephone follow‐up is also effective. Our systematic review identified 33 relevant studies, almost all of which were of low methodological quality (a major limitation of the review). We found that telephone follow‐up has been applied in many patient groups. There is great variety in the ways the telephone follow‐up has been performed. Many different outcomes have been measured. Some studies found effects in favour of the telephone follow‐up intervention, but overall studies identified no statistically significant differences between the telephone follow‐up and control groups. For as far as the results of studies could be pooled together, we could draw no firm conclusions about the effects of telephone follow‐up. No studies identified adverse effects of the intervention.
