There is high level evidence to support the safety and effectiveness of Botulinum toxin ‐A (BoNT‐A) as an adjunct to managing the upper limb in children with cerebral palsy. 
When injected into muscles BoNT‐A reduces muscle tightness. When used in conjunction with occupational therapy, the aim of BoNT‐A injections in the arms and hands is to improve movement and function in treated limbs. This review demonstrated improvements on a range of measures with the combined treatment. In the absence of significant side effects, injection of BoNT‐A has been identified as a safe and effective treatment for upper limb spasticity when used in combination with occupational therapy in children with cerebral palsy.
