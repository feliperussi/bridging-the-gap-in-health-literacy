Self‐help and guided self‐help for eating disorders
The eating disorders (anorexia nervosa (AN), bulimia nervosa (BN), binge eating disorder (BED) and eating disorder not otherwise specified (EDNOS)) are disabling conditions and specialist treatment is not always easily accessible. Self‐help may bridge the gap. This review aimed to evaluate pure self‐help (PSH) and guided self‐help (GSH) interventions for eating disorders for all ages and genders, compared to psychological, pharmacological or control treatments and waiting list. Fifteen trials were identified, all focused on BN, BED or EDNOS, using manual‐based self‐help. There is some evidence that PSH/GSH reduce eating disorder and other symptoms in comparison to waiting list or control treatment and may produce comparable outcomes to formal therapist‐delivered psychological therapies. PSH/GSH may have some utility as a first step in treatment. In the future there need to be large well‐conducted effectiveness studies of self‐help treatments with or without guidance incorporating cost evaluations and investigation of different types of self‐help in different populations and settings.
