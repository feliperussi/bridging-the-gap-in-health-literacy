Strategies to improve disease management and increase adherence to iron chelation therapy in people with thalassaemia 
Review question 
We wanted to see if there were any interventions using computer and mobile technology (e.g. cell phone, the Internet) that would help people manage their thalassemia better and adhere more to their iron chelation therapy. 
Background 
People with thalassaemia, who receive regular transfusions, are exposed to excess iron in their body. This can result in medical complications, including organ damage and death. Some medications are used to remove excess iron in the body, but these treatment schedules can be difficult to follow and have undesirable side effects. 
Search date 
The evidence is current to 20 June 2019.
Study characteristics 
We searched the literature for both randomized and non‚Äêrandomized studies, and found none which were eligible for inclusion. 
Key results 
We found no eligible studies of computer and mobile technology intervention strategies for individuals with thalassemia. 
Quality of evidence 
We did not identify any evidence for inclusion in the review.
