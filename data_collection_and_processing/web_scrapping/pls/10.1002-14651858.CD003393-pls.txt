Oestrogens alone or with amniotomy for cervical ripening or induction of labour
There is not enough evidence, from randomised controlled trials, to show the effects and safety of oestrogen to ripen the cervix and help bring on labour. 
Sometimes it is necessary to bring on labour artificially, because of safety concerns for either the pregnant woman or baby. Oestrogen is a hormone involved in the ripening of the neck of the womb (cervix) and preparing it for the birth of the baby. It is possible that oestrogen increases the release of other local hormones (prostaglandins) which help ripen the cervix. A variety of oestrogen preparations have been used (such as tablets, creams and infusions). They have been used for inductions when women are inpatients and outpatients. There is not enough research from the review of seven studies (with 465 women) to show the true effect of oestrogen. Oestrogen is not commonly used in current clinical practice as alternative agents that are known to be effective are available.
