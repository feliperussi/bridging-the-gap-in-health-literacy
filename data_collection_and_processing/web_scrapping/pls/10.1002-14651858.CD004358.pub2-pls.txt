Anticholinergics for prolonged non specific cough in children
Children with non‐specific cough, (non‐productive cough in the absence of identifiable chest disease) are commonly treated with a variety of medications for control of cough symptoms. This review examined the effect of inhaled anti‐cholinergic drugs in children with non‐specific cough. Currently there is no evidence to support the use of inhaled anti‐cholinergics as no randomised‐controlled trials of inhaled anti‐cholinergic medications in the management of prolonged non‐specific cough in children were found.
