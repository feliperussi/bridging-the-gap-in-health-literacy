Not certain that people are better off giving their own blood before surgery in case they need transfusion, when there is a safe blood bank 
Although in developed countries the safety of blood supplies is high, there is still concern about contracting illness from transfusion. People often give their own blood before surgery for use if transfusion is needed (autologous donation). However, the review of trials found that it is not certain that people benefit. While pre‐operative donation may reduce the chances of needing someone else's blood, it increases the chances of transfusion overall. It may be that donation causes some anaemia (low red blood cells), or surgeons are more likely to transfuse if autologous blood is available. Over‐transfusion has risks, especially for older people.
