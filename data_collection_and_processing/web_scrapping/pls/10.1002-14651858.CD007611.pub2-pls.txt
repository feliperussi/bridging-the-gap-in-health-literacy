No evidence to evaluate the potential benefits and harms of cryotherapy in the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma 
Liver cell cancer (hepatocellular carcinoma) is the most common primary cancer of the liver. Liver cancer is regarded as the third most common cause of death from cancer. Only a minority of the patients are candidates for liver surgery or liver transplantation. Cold therapy (cryotherapy), where rapid freezing causes cancerous cells' destruction and death, is one of several 'minimally invasive treatment techniques' that have been recently developed. Currently, no large well‐planned clinical investigations have been conducted to establish the potential benefits and harms associated with treating liver cell cancer patients with cryotherapy. Nor have any such investigations been undertaken to establish the superiority or inferiority of cryotherapy compared with other treatments for liver cell cancer. At present, there is no evidence to support or refute the alleged and potential benefits of cryotherapy. Large well‐designed randomised clinical trials are feasible and are necessary to define the role of cryotherapy in the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma.
