Low glycaemic index diets for cardiovascular disease
Background 
The glycaemic index (GI) is a measure of the ability of a carbohydrate (for example sugar or starch) to affect blood sugar levels. 
Study characteristics 
In this review update, we examined 21 randomised studies that assessed the effects of low GI diets compared to diets with a similar composition but a higher GI on cardiovascular disease events and levels of cholesterol in the blood or blood pressure (major risk factors for cardiovascular disease, such as heart attacks or stroke). Studies were included up to July 2016. 
Results 
Participants were adults with a mean age of between 19 and 69 years. In most studies, participants had cardiovascular risk factors such as overweight or obesity or abnormal blood fat levels, and one study included participants with existing heart disease. The diets were followed for at least 12 weeks but most studies had unclear of bias and some of the compared diets only had small differences in GI. Cardiovascular disease events were not reported and no evidence of differences in effects of the diets on blood cholesterol and blood pressure were seen. Most studies did not report harms but the two that did found no harmful effects of the diets, however the evidence was poor. 
Conclusions 
There was insufficient evidence from randomised controlled trials to recommend consumption of low GI diets for the purpose of improving blood lipids or blood pressure.
