Inhaled cromones for prolonged non‐specific cough in children
Children with non‐specific cough (coughing not due to a diagnosed respiratory disease), are commonly treated with a variety of medications to treat the symptoms of cough. This review examined whether there was any evidence for children with non‐specific cough to inhale cromoglycate and nedocromil (commonly called 'cromones'). There were no randomised controlled trials identified that assessed inhalation of cromones for prolonged non‐specific cough in children. In two non‐randomised studies, the researchers found that improvements were seen within two weeks of taking cromones. Because cromones have few adverse effects, they are an attractive treatment for children. However, there is no evidence to support their routine use for the symptoms of non‐specific cough in children. Further research examining the effects of this treatment is needed.
