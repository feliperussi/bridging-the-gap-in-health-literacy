Computed tomography angiography or magnetic resonance angiography for detecting blood vessel abnormalities in patients with intracerebral haemorrhage 
Blood vessel abnormalities are the leading cause of bleeding in the brain (known as intracerebral haemorrhage) in young adults. Early detection of blood vessel abnormalities may improve outcome if treatment can prevent bleeding recurrence. This review looked at different tests used to identify blood vessel abnormalities in the brain. Intra‚Äêarterial digital subtraction angiography (IADSA) is the standard test used and involves positioning a tube, introduced through a blood vessel in the groin, into blood vessels near the brain. Dye is directly injected into the brain's blood vessels using this tube. Computed tomographic angiography (CTA) and magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) are newer tests that may be done without any injections (MRA) or only through an injection into the arm (CTA and MRA). This review investigated the accuracy of CTA or MRA, or both, compared with IADSA after intracerebral haemorrhage. We found eight studies (involving 526 participants) that compared CTA with IADSA and three studies (involving 401 participants) that compared MRA with IADSA. Both CTA and MRA appear to have good accuracy when compared with IADSA. However, the studies were small and were limited in many cases by their design. Further research that looks at accuracy, practicality, and costs is needed.
