Not enough evidence on whether hyperventilation therapy improves outcomes for people with traumatic brain injury 
Traumatic brain injury is a major cause of premature death and disability. Severe head injury can trigger brain swelling, thereby increasing pressure on the brain (raised intracranial pressure, ICP). Raised ICP increases the likelihood of brain damage or death. Treatment to lower people's ICP commonly involves hyperventilation therapy (increasing blood oxygen levels) following the brain injury. While hyperventilation therapy can reduce ICP after traumatic brain injury, the review of trials found there is no strong evidence about whether this improves outcomes. More trials are needed.
