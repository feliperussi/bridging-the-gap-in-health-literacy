Hepatitis B vaccines achieve antibody production in patients with chronic renal failure, but we do not know if the vaccines are protective 
Patients with chronic renal failure are at increased risk of hepatitis B virus infections. This review was undertaken to determine the beneficial and harmful effects of vaccination against hepatitis B and of a reinforced recombinant vaccination series. None of the trials had high methodological quality. Plasma vaccine was significantly more effective than placebo in achieving hepatitis B antibodies. Yet no statistically significant difference was found between the use of plasma vaccine or placebo in preventing hepatitis B virus infections. No trials comparing recombinant vaccine with placebo were identified. There was no significant difference between recombinant and plasma vaccines or between a reinforced vaccination series and routine vaccinations of three inoculations using recombinant vaccine regarding achieving hepatitis B antibodies.
