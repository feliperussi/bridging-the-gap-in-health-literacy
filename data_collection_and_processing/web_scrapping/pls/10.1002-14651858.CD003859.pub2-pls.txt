Disclosing to parents newborn carrier status identified by routine blood spot screening
No guidance is available on the best approach to disclosing to parents newborn carrier status inadvertently identified by routine newborn blood spot screening. 
Newborn screening programs may inadvertently identify infants who are unaffected by serious in‚Äêborn errors such as sickle cell disorders or cystic fibrosis, but who are genetic carriers. This will not affect the health of the child but may have important health, social and/emotional effects on the family. No trials were found about the impact or effects of disclosing newborn carrier status. There is an urgent need to develop clear guidance as how best to communicate this information effectively.
