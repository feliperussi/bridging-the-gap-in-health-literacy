Plasma transfusion strategies for critically ill patients
Plasma transfusions are a frequently used treatment for critically ill patients, and they are usually prescribed to correct abnormal coagulation tests and to prevent or stop bleeding. Although plasma transfusions are frequently prescribed for critically ill patients, some of the reasons for their use are not supported by evidence from medical research. Some research has found an association of plasma transfusions with worse outcomes, and other studies have suggested that plasma transfusions do not help to return blood to its normal thickness. It is important to identify which patients, if any, may benefit from plasma transfusions. 
We searched the medical literature for reports of randomised controlled trials of plasma transfusion in people with a critical illness. Upon reading 843 study records, we found that currently no randomised trials have compared different plasma transfusion strategies. Such studies are needed to help physicians prescribe plasma transfusion only for patients who will benefit from them. 
Two main obstacles are associated with designing a randomised controlled trial on this topic, but they can be overcome. Currently, no consensus has been reached on the best way to determine whether a patient requires a plasma transfusion. Another obstacle is the difficulty involved in identifying important bleeding, as one must consider not only the amount of bleeding but also its location, the body's own response to the bleeding (haemodynamic response) and the need for red blood cell transfusions.
