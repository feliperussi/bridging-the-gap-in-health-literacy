Malaria is a parasitic disease, spread by mosquitoes. It affects millions of people worldwide, and causes significant illness and mortality. Uncomplicated malaria presents with symptoms such as fever, headache, muscle pain, and vomiting. The parasite has become resistant to a number of previously effective drugs, and so combinations of drugs are used to try increase cure and to prevent further resistance. Artemether‐lumefantrine is one such drug combination. This review of trials showed that the six‐dose regimen of artemether‐lumefantrine was associated with high cure rates and was more effective that most other drug combinations used for uncomplicated malaria. Further research is needed to properly assess adverse outcomes.
