This review assesses the usefulness surgery for anal fissure, a painful ulcer at the anal opening, by comparing the efficacy of various surgical procedures and how likely they are to result in complications. 
Does surgery provide a long term cure for anal fissure? Yes, in better than 90% of patients having recommended operative procedures. Such operations include principally partial division of the anal sphincter, or controlled dilation of the narrowed anal opening. The technique for cutting the muscle has been refined in recent years and appears to improve cure and diminish the risk of bowel control problems. The method of achieving controlled anal dilation needs further investigation. 
Can surgery cause anal incontinence? In the past, definitely, though in a minority of patients, and certain procedures were more prone to cause this complication. In recent years the risk appears to be diminishing as operative procedures have improved and is now a risk of less than 5%. Usually, in those affected individuals, there are only problems controlling flatus.
