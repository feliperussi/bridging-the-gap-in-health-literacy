Nutritional interventions for liver transplanted patients
Poor nutritional status is a common problem in patients waiting for liver transplantation and it is a risk factor for post‐transplant morbidity and mortality. Nutritional status can worsen rapidly in the postoperative period due to preoperative malnutrition, the stress of the surgical procedure, immunosuppressive therapy, and in some patients liver or kidney dysfunction or sepsis. Nutritional interventions for people on a waiting list for liver transplantation include nutritional supplements providing additional protein, fat, and carbohydrates as well as liver‐adapted formulas also containing branched‐chain amino acids. Nutritional interventions after liver transplantation consist of parenteral or enteral nutrition and oral nutritional supplementation during the postoperative phase. 
This systematic review of 13 randomised clinical trials found that there is no convincing evidence for beneficial effects of nutritional interventions for liver‐transplanted patients. Accordingly, we could not recommend any specific intervention. More research is needed to identify effective nutritional interventions for patients before and after liver transplantation.
