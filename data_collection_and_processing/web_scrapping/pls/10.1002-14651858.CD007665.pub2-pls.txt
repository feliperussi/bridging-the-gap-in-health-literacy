Treatment for leiomyosarcoma and leiomyoma in children with HIV infection
There is a lack of reliable evidence on interventions for treating leiomyosarcoma and leiomyoma in children with HIV/AIDS. Smooth muscle tumour (SMT) is a type of cancer composed of leiomyoma and leiomyosarcoma. Although there are many more cases among adults with HIV infection than with children, an increasing number of SMTs have been described in HIV‚Äêinfected children. Leiomyosarcoma has become the second most frequent malignancy in children with HIV infection or other immunodeficiency diseases in the United States; however, there is a lack of uniform and effective therapies and their efficacy and safety still are unknown. No randomised controlled trials and clinical controlled trials of interventions for leiomyosarcoma and leiomyoma in children with AIDS were found that rigorously evaluated effectiveness.
