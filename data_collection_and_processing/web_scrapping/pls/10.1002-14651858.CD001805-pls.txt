Plasma volume expansion for treatment of pre‐eclampsia
Not enough evidence to show the effects of plasma volume expansion for women with pre‐eclampsia. 
Blood plasma volume increases gradually in women during the second half of pregnancy. The increase is usually greater for women with multiple pregnancies and less for those with small babies. Plasma volume is reduced in women with pre‐eclampsia (pregnancy induced complication that includes high blood pressure). It is possible that women with pre‐eclampsia might benefit from expanded plasma volume if it were to increase blood circulation for the mother and baby. The review of trials found there was not enough evidence to show the effects of plasma volume expansion for women with pre‐eclampsia. More research is needed.
