Interventions for motor apraxia following stroke
People with motor apraxia after stroke often have difficulty carrying out everyday activities such as making a hot drink. Some people cannot select the right object at the right time or have difficulty using objects (such as a spoon) correctly. Apraxia is not due to muscle weakness or sensory loss. Instead it seems to be a loss or disturbance of the conceptual ability to organise actions to achieve a goal. This review of three studies, including 132 participants, suggests that further high quality research is required before specific treatment techniques can be accepted or rejected. Patients with apraxia should continue to receive general stroke rehabilitation services but better quality research is needed to identify optimal apraxia treatments.
