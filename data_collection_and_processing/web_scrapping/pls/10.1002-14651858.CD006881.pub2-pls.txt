Androgens for the anaemia of chronic kidney disease in adults
Anaemia, which occurs when red blood cell and haemoglobin levels fall below normal, is a common problem among adults with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Anaemia can cause breathlessness, dizziness and chest pain (angina); reduce ability to think clearly; limits ability to exercise; and contributes to sexual problems, poor appetite and reduced quality of life. Anaemia may also cause longer hospital stays, and sometimes death. 
There are several approaches to correct anaemia in people with CKD, including drugs to stimulate red blood cell production, dialysis to remove waste and excess water from the blood, blood transfusions, dietary management, and supplementary iron and folate agents. 
Other drugs, such as androgens ‐ which are male steroid hormones ‐ may be given in some settings to help reduce undesirable effects of treatments. Another possible benefit of androgen therapy for people with CKD, especially in regions with limited health resources, is that these drugs have lower costs than some other treatments. 
We assessed eight small studies that presented data from 181 adults with CKD‐related anaemia that investigated use of androgen therapy. Limitations and flaws in the evidence lead to our conclusion that androgen therapy for adults with CKD‐related anaemia was not associated with substantial benefits.
