Evidence on beneficial or harmful effects of bicyclol for chronic hepatitis C is not found 
Bicyclol is a novel synthetic 'anti‐hepatitis' drug, used primarily in China for patients with chronic hepatitis C. Only one small, short‐term randomised clinical trial was found evaluating the efficacy of bicyclol for patients with chronic hepatitis C. Clinicians should be aware of the lack of evidence for bicyclol.
