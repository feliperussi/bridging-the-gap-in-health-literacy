Polyethylene Glycol should be used in preference to Lactulose in the treatment of Chronic Constipation. 
Constipation is a common clinical problem, encompassing much more than reduced stool frequency. In this review we compared two commonly used osmotic laxatives, Lactulose and Polyethylene Glycol (PEG).  The findings of our work indicate that PEG is better than lactulose in outcomes of stool frequency per week, form of stool, relief of abdominal pain and the need for additional products. This is seen in both adults and children. Only exception is for relief of abdominal pain, where PEG is better than lactulose in children, but not in adults (no difference is seen).  We conclude that Polyethylene Glycol should be used in preference to Lactulose in the treatment of Chronic Constipation.
