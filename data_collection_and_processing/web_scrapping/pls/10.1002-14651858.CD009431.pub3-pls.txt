Medications which promote stomach movement to relieve upper abdominal discomfort that does not have a specific cause 
Background 
Functional dyspepsia occurs in people with upper abdominal discomfort that does not have an obvious, specific cause. Prokinetics may help people with functional dyspepsia, by promoting stomach movement. 
Study characteristics 
We included 43 studies that compared prokinetics with either placebo (powder that has the appearance similar to drug) or another prokinetic for treatment of functional dyspepsia. The studies were limited to those which assessed only adults who presented with upper abdominal discomfort but who did not have a specific cause after investigation. 
Key results 
We are uncertain whether prokinetics reduce dyspeptic symptoms, compared to no prokinetic treatment. We are also uncertain which prokinetics had the most efficacy in reducing dyspeptic symptoms, improving post‚Äêtreatment symptom scores, or improving the mean difference of symptom score. We are uncertain whether prokinetic treatment can improve quality of life. We are uncertain whether prokinetics (except cisapride) differ from no prokinetic in producing unpleasant symptoms. The most common unpleasant symptoms from prokinetics were diarrhoea, abdominal discomfort and nausea. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the evidence was graded as low or very low. We need more research to prove the benefit of prokinetics for treatment in people with functional dyspepsia.
