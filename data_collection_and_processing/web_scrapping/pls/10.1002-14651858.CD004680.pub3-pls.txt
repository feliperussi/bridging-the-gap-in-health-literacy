Catheter type, placement and insertion techniques for preventing peritonitis in peritoneal dialysis patients 
What is the issue? 
People with kidney failure may be treated with peritoneal dialysis where a catheter is permanently inserted into the peritoneum (lining around abdominal contents) through the abdominal wall and sterile fluid is drained in and out several times overnight or during the day. The most common serious complication is infection of the peritoneum ‚Äê peritonitis. This may be caused by germs which may be accidentally introduced via the catheter into the peritoneum resulting in peritonitis. 
What did we do? 
We conducted a review of the literature to examine the effects of different methods of catheter insertion and different types of catheter in prevention of peritonitis in PD patients. 
What did we find? 
We identified 42 studies (3144 participants) examining the effects of different methods of catheter insertion and types of catheter on peritonitis. The risk of peritonitis was not affected by different types of insertion methods or types of catheters inserted. 
Conclusions 
There is no evidence to support a specific catheter insertion technique or type of catheter with the aim to prevent peritonitis in peritoneal dialysis patients.
