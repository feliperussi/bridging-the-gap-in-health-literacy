The use of Nitrous Oxide gas during Colonoscopy procedures
Colonoscopy is now the main investigation for large bowel illnesses, including cancer, but it can be an uncomfortable or painful procedure. To help reduce the pain/discomfort, endoscopists use narcotics or hypnotics with or without other analgesics, but this, in turn, comes with risks on the heart as well as on breathing. This review found that Nitrous Oxide gas works as good sedation, it leads to faster recover after the procedure and a short stay at the endoscopy unit, with little risk to breathing or the heart.
