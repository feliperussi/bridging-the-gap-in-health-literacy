Topiramate for juvenile myoclonic epilepsy
Background 
Juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (JME) is characterized by involuntary (uncontrolled) twitching of muscles in the shoulders and arms after awakening, often starting in childhood. 
Study characteristics 
We searched scientific databases for clinical trials comparing the antiepileptic medication, topiramate, with placebo (a pretend treatment) or another antiepileptic drug in people with JME. We wanted to evaluate how well topiramate worked and if it had any side effects. 
Key results 
We included and analyzed three randomized controlled trials (clinical studies where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups) with 83 participants. Based on the information in these trials, it seems that topiramate is better tolerated than valproate, but is no more effective than valproate. Topiramate seemed to work better than placebo, but this result was based on a small number of included people. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the evidence from the studies was very low and the results should be interpreted with caution. More randomized controlled trials with large numbers of participants are required to test how effective and well tolerated topiramate is in people with JME. Future trials should be well‐designed and double‐blinded (where neither the participant nor the researcher know which treatment has been given until after the results have been collected). 
ConclusionsThis review does not provide sufficient evidence to support topiramate for the treatment of people with JME. 
The evidence is current to August 2021.
