A daily low dose of cotrimoxazole for preventing opportunistic infections in adults with HIV 
Cotrimoxazole helps to prevent infections in adults who are HIV‐infected but may increase resistance to the drug and more trials are needed. 
Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) attacks the immune system, leaving people vulnerable to infections. Such infections often cause death or serious complications. Anti‐viral drugs can slow HIV. However, most HIV‐infected people live in developing countries without access to these treatments. Preventing infections is therefore the main aim of HIV treatment in developing countries. A daily low dose of cotrimoxazole , an antibiotic (a drug that fights bacterial infections), is used to try to prevent infections and improve survival, but with unknown effectiveness for HIV‐infected people. The review found cotrimoxazole improved survival in some areas of Africa and found improvements in other outcomes, but adverse effects and possible drug resistance are unclear. More trials are needed.
