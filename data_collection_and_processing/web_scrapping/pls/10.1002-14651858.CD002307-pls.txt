Mast‐cell stabilising agents to prevent exercise‐induced bronchoconstriction
Exercise‐induced bronchoconstriction, also commonly called exercise‐induced asthma, is associated with symptoms such as cough (locker room cough), wheezing, shortness of breath, and chest tightness following exercise. While an episode is generally self‐limiting, it can cause those afflicted to avoid vigorous activity and serious athletes to under‐perform by limiting endurance and prolonging recovery time. The combined results from the studies, determined that short‐acting beta‐agonists inhaled prior to exercise reduced the severity of attacks in both adults and children when compared to mast cell stabilizers alone. In addition, the mast‐cell stabilizers were slightly more effective than anticholinergic bronchodilators. Combining short‐acting beta‐agonists and mast‐cell stabilizers was no more effective than the agents administered alone. There were no significant adverse effects reported with the short term use of any of the drugs.
