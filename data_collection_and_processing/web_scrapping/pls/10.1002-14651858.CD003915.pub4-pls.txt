More chemotherapy helps women with advanced endometrial cancer; however, the best combination of chemotherapy drugs is still not clear 
Using more chemotherapy drugs in combination seems to help women with advanced or recurrent endometrial cancer to live for longer and to delay the cancer from spreading or getting worse. However, giving these extra drugs may cause more serious short‐term side effects. We do not know what effect using more drugs has on long‐term side effects, control of symptoms or quality of life because they were poorly studied in the individual trials included in this review.
