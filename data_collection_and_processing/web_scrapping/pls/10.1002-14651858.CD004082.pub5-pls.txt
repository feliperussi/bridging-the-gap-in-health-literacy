Perioperative increase in global blood flow to explicit defined goals and outcomes following surgery 
Death and serious complications commonly occur following major surgery and are a significant public health problem. These outcomes might be prevented by using fluids and drugs to maintain the supply of oxygen and other nutrients to vital organs. Global blood flow, adjusted to maintain specific targets, might serve as a proxy in determining whether administered fluid and drugs maintain critical nutrient supply. In this Cochrane review of 31 studies conducted in 5292 patients undergoing major surgery, the use of fluids, with or without additional drugs, to achieve defined targets associated with increased total blood flow did not reduce mortality. There was a reduction in the number of patients with complications and the length of time patients stayed in hospital (by 1.2 days). However, the quality of the studies in this area was mediocre.
