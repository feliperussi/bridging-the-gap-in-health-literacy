Cognitive behavioural therapy for older adults (aged 60+) with sleep problems
Sleep problems become more common with age, affect quality of life for individuals and their families, and can increase healthcare costs. Older people are often prescribed a range of drugs for their health problems (including with sleep) many of which have side effects. This review considered the effectiveness of cognitive and behavioural treatments (CBT). These aim to improve sleep by changing poor sleep habits and by challenging negative thoughts, attitudes and beliefs about sleep. Reviewers report that there is only limited evidence available, and what data there is suggests a mild effect of CBT.
