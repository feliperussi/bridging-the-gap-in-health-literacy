Cholinesterase inhibitors (ChEIs), donepezil, galantamine and rivastigmine are efficacious for mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease 
Alzheimer's disease is the commonest cause of dementia affecting older people, and is associated with loss of cholinergic neurons in parts of the brain. Cholinesterase inhibitors (ChEIs), donepezil, galantamine and rivastigmine, delay the breakdown of acetylcholine released into synaptic clefts and so enhance cholinergic neurotransmission. The three cholinesterase inhibitors are efficacious for mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease. Despite the slight variations in the mode of action of the three cholinesterase inhibitors there is no evidence of any differences between them with respect to efficacy. The evidence from one large trial shows fewer adverse events associated with donepezil compared with rivastigmine.
