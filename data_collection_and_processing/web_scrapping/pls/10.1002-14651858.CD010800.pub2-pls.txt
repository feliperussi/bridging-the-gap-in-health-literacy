Terbutaline pump maintenance therapy after threatened preterm labour for reducing adverse neonatal outcomes 
Babies born too early (preterm birth) are at high risk of poor outcomes, and the earlier they are born the greater their risk. Preterm babies are more likely to die or have serious disability as children, including cerebral palsy and other similar conditions. Women who go into very early labour (before 34 weeks) and have their contractions stopped by intravenous drugs are at high risk of going back into preterm labour. Terbutaline is a drug that can relax the uterus and possibly stop contractions. Taken orally, though, it does not seem to prevent contractions returning. Another option is to use a small portable pump that feeds a continuous dose of terbutaline under the skin. This has the advantage of using a lower daily dose with faster onset of action and good tolerability because of fewer side effects than when taken by mouth. We found four studies involving 234 women who had been in preterm labour and had their contractions stopped. We found no evidence of terbutaline maintenance therapy offering any advantages over saline placebo pump or oral terbutaline maintenance therapy in reducing adverse neonatal outcomes by prolonging pregnancy among women with arrested preterm labour. The review found there are not enough large trials to show whether terbutaline pump maintenance therapy is safe or effective.
