Treatment for meralgia paraesthetica, a condition causing numbness and sometimes pain in the thigh 
Meralgia paraesthetica is a common clinical condition caused by damage to the lateral cutaneous nerve of the thigh, resulting in pain, numbness and tingling in the front and outer side of the thigh. The diagnosis is easy to make clinically. Although not life‚Äêthreatening, the condition can cause a lot of discomfort to the affected individual. A number of interventions are in common use and we wanted to examine the evidence in the literature for their efficacy. We found no randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in the original review or when searches were updated in 2010 and 2012. Local injections of corticosteroid and surgical operations were found to be effective treatments in observational studies. However, a single observational study also showed that meralgia paraesthetica improved spontaneously in the majority of cases. RCTs of treatments for meralgia paraesthetica are needed.
