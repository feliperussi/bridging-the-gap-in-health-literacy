Multidiscliplinary care for Guillain‐Barré syndrome
Guillain‐Barré syndrome (GBS) is a neurological disease which generally presents with worsening weakness and altered sensation and, not uncommonly, difficulties with breathing. It can cause long‐term disability which is amenable to rehabilitative treatment, delivered by a 'multidisciplinary' team that is made up of different disciplines (for example, doctors, nurses, therapists) working in a co‐ordinated and organised manner. 
This review did not find any randomised controlled trials that examined the effectiveness of such multidisciplinary care. The evidence from very low quality non‐randomised studies suggests that such care may improve disability and quality of life in the short term. 
The gap in current research should not be interpreted as proof that multidisciplinary care is ineffective. Further research into types of appropriate studies, caregiver needs and various aspects of multidisciplinary care in the Guillain‐Barré syndrome population is needed.
