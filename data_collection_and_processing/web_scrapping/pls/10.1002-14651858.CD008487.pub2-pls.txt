Acupuncture for treating functional dyspepsia
Functional dyspepsia (FD) has been a worldwide gastric disorder. More effective therapies are needed with fewer adverse effects than are seen with conventional medications. In the East, acupuncture has been recognized for a long time as a positive therapy for the treatment of functional gastric disorders. To date, no robust evidence on its efficacy and safety has been found. The evidence obtained has overwhelmingly supported no significance of acupuncture compared with medications and superiority of acupuncture compared with sham acupuncture in FD treatment; however, the low quality of evidence obtained has not permitted a robust conclusion concerning the efficacy and safety of acupuncture in the treatment of FD.
