Oral versus injectable ovulation induction agents for unexplained subfertility
For many couples who cannot become pregnant, no reason is apparent after investigation (unexplained infertility). One treatment option for these couples is for the woman to be given medications to increase the number of eggs she produces each cycle. This treatment is also sometimes combined with a technique of purifying the partner's sperm and injecting it through the woman's cervix at her fertile time. This review of trials looked at which type of these medications, oral‐form or injection‐form, were the best in producing the most successful outcome. The review found no significant benefit of using one type of medication (oral or injectable) over the other, although there were insufficient data from trials. More research is needed to examine this question.
