Treatments for acute central retinal artery occlusion (blockage of the blood supply to the retina of the eye) 
Central retinal artery occlusion occurs when the blood supply to the inner part of the retina (the light sensitive layer inside the eye) is suddenly stopped. If the blockage is removed in time, and the blood supply returns to the retina, full recovery is possible. However, if the blockage is prolonged the retina dies. Various methods have been tried in an attempt to remove the blockage including massaging the eye, lowering the pressure inside the eye and dissolving clots with drugs. Which of these methods is best for re‐establishing the blood supply is not known and some of the treatments can be associated with serious adverse effects. This review did find two studies that suggested that the blood supply to the retina could be improved with the treatments they tested ‐ although vision was not shown to be improved with either method in the study population. These were, however, small studies and did have potential flaws so more research is still needed.
