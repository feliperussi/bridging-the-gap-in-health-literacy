Photorefractive keratectomy (PRK) versus laser assisted in situ keratomileusis (LASIK) for correction of long‐sightedness 
Hyperopia (long‐sightedness or far‐sightedness) is the condition where the relaxed eye brings parallel light to a focus behind the retina instead of on it. In order to correct hyperopia a variety of surgical techniques can be applied including PRK and LASIK. There exists an uncertainty as to which technique provides more accurate, stable and safe results. As no randomised controlled trials were found that met the inclusion criteria, we could not find definite answers to these questions and therefore concluded that more research is required.
