Laparoscopy ( "keyhole" surgery ) has fewer complications than other forms of tubal ligation ( tying the tubes for contraception ), but requires more skills and equipment 
Tubal ligation or sterilisation ( tying the tubes ) is a common method of fertility regulation. It is usually done by using the following methods: mini‐laparotomy ( through a small cut in the abdomen ), laparoscopy ( "keyhole" surgery ‐ through a tube inserted through the umbilicus ( belly button ) or a very small cut ), or culdoscopy ( using a tube, but through the vagina ). The review found that overall, laparoscopy had fewer complications than mini‐laparotomy, but it requires more sophisticated expensive equipment and greater skills. Culdoscopy has higher rates of complications.
