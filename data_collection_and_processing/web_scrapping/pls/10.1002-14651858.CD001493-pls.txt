Inhaled beta2‐agonists for asthma in mechanically ventilated patients
During an asthma attack, the airways narrow, causing breathing problems, wheezing and coughing. A small number of people with asthma need medications given by tubes during mechanically assisted breathing (ventilation). Inhaled bronchodilators help relieve asthma attacks in people who can breathe on their own. However, it is not known if inhaled beta2‐agonists (commonly used as bronchodilators), work well for people on ventilation. This review of trials did not find enough evidence to show the effect of inhaled beta2‐agonists on people who have mechanically assisted breathing or tubes. More research is needed.
