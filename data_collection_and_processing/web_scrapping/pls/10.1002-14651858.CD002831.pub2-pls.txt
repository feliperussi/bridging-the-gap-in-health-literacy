Psychoeducation added to standard treatment for schizophrenia reduces relapse
The purpose of patient education/teaching (or psychoeducation) is to increase patients' knowledge and understanding of their illness and treatment. It is supposed that increased knowledge enables people with schizophrenia to cope more effectively with their illness. Psychoeducational interventions involve interaction between the information provider and the mentally ill person. This review compares the efficacy of psychoeducation added to standard care as a means of helping severely mentally ill people with that of standard care alone. The evidence shows a significant reduction of relapse or readmission rates. There seems to be some suggestion that psychoeducation may improve compliance with medication, but the extent of improvement remains unclear. The findings show a possibility that psychoeducation has a positive effect on a person's well being and promotes better social function. In the medium term, treating four people with schizophrenia with psychoeducation instead of standard care resulted in one additional person showing a clinical improvement. The scarcity of studies made the comparison between the efficacy of different formats (programmes of 10 sessions or less or 11 or more, individual or group sessions) weak.
