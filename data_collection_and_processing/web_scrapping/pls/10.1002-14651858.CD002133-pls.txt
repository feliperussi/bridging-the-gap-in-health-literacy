Ticlopidine plus aspirin is better than oral anticoagulants alone for reducing the risk of revascularization, non‐fatal myocardial infarction and bleeding following stenting of coronary arteries 
Stents are placed in arteries around the heart (coronary arteries) to keep formerly blocked arteries open. A blood clot (thrombus) may form in the coronary artery after stenting and cause acute myocardial infarction (fatal or non‐fatal) or more surgery. Blood thinners must be given for a short time to prevent clotting. Ticlopidine plus aspirin reduce the risk of complications after coronary stenting with less bleeding when compared to standard treatment (oral anticoagulants). Ticlopidine plus aspirin have other side effects such as bone marrow toxicity. Strict monitoring of blood‐cell counts is recommended during treatment.
