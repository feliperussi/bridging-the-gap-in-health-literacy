Interventions for age‐related visual problems in patients with stroke
As people get older they are more likely to develop age‐related visual problems (such as age‐related macular degeneration, cataracts, glaucoma and diabetic retinopathy). As the incidence of stroke increases with age, a significant proportion of stroke patients will have age‐related visual problems. This review aimed to determine if interventions for age‐related visual problems improve functional ability following stroke. We were specifically interested in whether people with stroke responded differently from the general population when treated for age‐related visual problems and also whether assessment and interventions for age‐related visual problems could improve functional ability during stroke rehabilitation. After a complex search we identified no studies for inclusion in this review. Currently best evidence comes from a series of Cochrane reviews which evaluate the effect of specific interventions for different age‐related visual problems (in the general population). We recommend that analyses are carried out within these reviews to explore the impact of these interventions on the subgroup of people with stroke. We encountered a number of methodological problems during this review, relating to selection criteria for including studies; we recommend that this is clarified before future updates of this review are carried out.
