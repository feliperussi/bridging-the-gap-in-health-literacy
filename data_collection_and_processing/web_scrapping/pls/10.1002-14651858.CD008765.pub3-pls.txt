Surgery to remove tumour so that it is not visible with the naked eye prolongs survival in women with recurrent epithelial ovarian cancer 
Epithelial ovarian cancer is a disease in which malignant cells form in the tissue covering the ovary. It accounts for about 90% of ovarian cancers; the remaining 10% arise from germ cells or the sex cords and stroma of the ovary. Women with epithelial ovarian cancer that has returned after primary treatment (recurrent disease) may need secondary surgery to remove all or part of the cancer. When ovarian cancer recurs after more than six months it is considered suitable for further treatment with platinum chemotherapy (platinum sensitive). 
The results of this review suggest that surgery may be associated with improved outcomes in terms of prolonging life in some women (platinum‐sensitive disease). In particular, surgery removing all visible disease is associated with a significant improvement in survival, although this may be due to the cancer biology facilitating surgery, rather than the surgery itself. We conclude from the current evidence that surgery with the aim of removing all visible disease should be considered in women with recurrent ovarian cancer on an individual basis. However, the data are limited to non‐randomised studies with a median age of women in their 50s and early 60s, which may not be representative of all women with ovarian cancer. The risks of major surgery need to be carefully balanced against potential benefits on a case‐by‐case basis.
