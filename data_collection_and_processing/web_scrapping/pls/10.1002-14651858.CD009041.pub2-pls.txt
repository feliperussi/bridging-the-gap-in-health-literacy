Breathing exercises for dysfunctional breathing/hyperventilation syndrome
Background  Dysfunctional breathing/hyperventilation syndrome (DB/HVS) is a breathing problem that involves breathing too deeply and/or too rapidly (hyperventilation). There are many possible causes of DB/HVS and if left untreated it can lead to a variety of unpleasant symptoms such as breathlessness, dizziness, pins and needles and chest pain. 
Review question  The aim of this review was to investigate whether breathing exercises are useful in the treatment of dysfunctional breathing/hyperventilation syndrome. The overall aim of all breathing exercises is to teach the patient to breathe gently using the lower part of their chest, at a rate that matches their activity level. 
Key results  Only one study met the criteria for inclusion in this review, in which participants also received relaxation therapy. This study had a small number of participants and provided very little detail as to how it was undertaken. Although the trial report suggested that breathing exercises may be beneficial in the treatment of this particular patient group no numerical data were presented so we could not be sure. No reliable conclusions can be drawn from this small, isolated study.
