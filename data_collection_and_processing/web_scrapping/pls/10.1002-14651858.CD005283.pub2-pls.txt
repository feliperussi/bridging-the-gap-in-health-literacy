The use of biocompatible dialysis membranes compared with biocompatible membranes does not appear to have a different effect on mortality in patients with acute renal failure (ARF) 
ARF is a common complication of critically ill patients. Death rates are high despite technological advances in kidney replacement treatments, including the use of a dialyzer or artificial kidney to remove toxins from the blood. Dialyzers are manufactured with different materials and are classified as bioincompatible (BICM) or biocompatible (BCM), as they elicit different biological responses when they come into contact with blood. An initial reported benefit of BCM over BICM, was not confirmed by subsequent studies. In this systematic review, a meta‐analysis combining results of several studies of patients with dialysis‐requiring ARF, no clinical advantage was demonstrable with the use of BCM.
