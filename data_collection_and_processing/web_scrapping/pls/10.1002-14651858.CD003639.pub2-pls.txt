Alpha‐glucosidase inhibitors for type 2 diabetes mellitus
Alpha‐glucosidase inhibitors may be used for patients with type 2 diabetes. They delay the absorbance of carbohydrates ('complex form of sugar') in the gut. In this review we present data from meta‐analyses that show (among other things) a decrease in glycated haemoglobin, fasting and post‐load blood glucose and post‐load insulin. But we found no evidence for an effect on mortality or morbidity. We found clues that with higher dosages the effect on glycated haemoglobin, in contrast to post‐load blood glucose, remains the same. This might be because a lower compliance due to increasing side‐effects.
