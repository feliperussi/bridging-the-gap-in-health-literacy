Decongestants, antihistamines and nasal irrigation for acute sinusitis in children
Review question 
The goal of this review was to determine whether there is any evidence in the medical literature for or against the use of decongestants, antihistamines and nasal irrigation for acute sinusitis in children. 
Background 
Young children experience an average of six to eight colds per year. Out of every 10 children with a cold, one develops sinusitis. Sinusitis occurs when the sinuses, which do not drain properly during a cold, become secondarily infected with bacteria. Instead of getting better, children with sinusitis often have worsening or persistent cold symptoms. In order to alleviate the symptoms of sinusitis, parents and physicians often resort to using decongestants, antihistamines and nasal irrigation. These treatments are available without requiring a prescription and are widely used. 
Previous studies have shown that the use of antihistamines and decongestants in children is associated with significant side effects. 
Search date

Study characteristics
