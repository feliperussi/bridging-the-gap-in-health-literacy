Thiazide diuretics and hip fracture
Twenty‐one studies of observational nature with nearly four hundred thousand participants were included in this systematic review. Studies looked for an association between thiazide diuretic use and hip fracture. The majority of included studies have low to moderate risk of bias. Thiazide diuretic use was associated with a reduction in risk of hip fracture. Randomized controlled trials are needed to confirm these findings.
