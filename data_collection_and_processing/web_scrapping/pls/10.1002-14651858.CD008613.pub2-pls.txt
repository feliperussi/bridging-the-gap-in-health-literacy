Hormone replacement therapy for women with type 1 diabetes mellitus
There are increasing numbers of people living with type 1 diabetes mellitus. The main aim of treatment for diabetes is to maintain good quality of life and to minimise, or prevent, the development of diabetic complications by controlling blood glucose levels. Women with type 1 diabetes frequently express difficulties in controlling their blood glucose levels during the menopausal phase of their lives. However, the cause of this has not been explored. 
Hormone replacement therapy is a treatment that is prescribed to many women to alleviate the symptoms associated with the menopause. 
The literature surrounding hormone replacement therapy and type 1 diabetes has never been systematically searched and reviewed. 
The evidence available for healthcare professionals to call upon relating to the management of menopausal women with type 1 diabetes is vague. There is conflicting literature regarding the use of hormone replacement therapy in women with type 1 diabetes, as many of the studies also included women with type 2 diabetes. We found one study with a type 1 diabetes subgroup involving 56 participants receiving either hormone replacement therapy or placebo over 12 months. No statistically significant differences were found between hormone replacement therapy and placebo. Patient‐important outcomes like death from any cause, cardiovascular disease (for example, heart attack, stroke), diabetic complications (for example, diabetic eye disease, diabetic kidney disease) or health‐related quality of life were not investigated.
