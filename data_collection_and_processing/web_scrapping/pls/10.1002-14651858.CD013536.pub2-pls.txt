Parenting programmes for parents with schizophrenia or related serious mental illness
Review question 
How effective are parenting programmes for people with schizophrenia or related serious mental illness? 
Background 
Around one third of people with schizophrenia are a parent. Parenting programmes aim to provide support and training for parents to help manage their child's behaviour. Targeted parenting programmes for this group could have a positive effect for both the parents and their children. This review aimed to gather the current evidence for parenting programmes for people with schizophrenia or related mental illness to understand whether such support is effective at improving parenting skills or parent‚Äêchild interaction. 
Searching 
We ran an electronic search in March 2020 and February 2021 for randomised controlled trials of parenting programmes aimed at people with schizophrenia or related serious mental illness. We found 36 studies and checked these to see if they were relevant to our research. 
Available evidence 
One trial met the review requirements but did not provide usable data. Therefore, there is not enough robust evidence to know anything about the effectiveness of parenting programmes for people with schizophrenia or related mental illness. 
Conclusions 
There is not enough evidence to make recommendations about parenting programmes for people with schizophrenia or related serious mental illness. Future research should conduct rigorous studies to test the effectiveness of parenting programmes that have already been designed.
