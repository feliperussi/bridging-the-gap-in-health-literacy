Lycopene for the prevention of prostate cancer
Prostate cancer is a common form of cancer affecting men worldwide. Pharmaceutical interventions, such as 5‐alpha reductase inhibitors, have been identified as potentially preventing prostate cancer incidence in men. Many men modify lifestyle and consume complementary and alternative medicines to maintain better health and prevent disease. Lycopene is a supplement that has been suggested may assist in the prevention of prostate cancer due to its antioxidant effects. The objective of this systematic review was to identify the effectiveness of lycopene in the prevention of prostate cancer. This review identified 3 relevant studies, comprising 154 participants in total. Two of the studies were assessed to be of 'high' risk of bias. Meta‐analysis of two studies indicated no statistical difference in prostate specific antigen (PSA) levels between men randomised to receive lycopene and the comparison group (MD ‐0.34, 95% CI ‐2.01 to 1.32). None of the studies assessed prostate cancer mortality. No other meta‐analyses were possible since other outcomes assessed only had one study contributing data.
