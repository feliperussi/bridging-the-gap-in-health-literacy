Vitamin A for non‐measles pneumonia in children
Acute respiratory infections, mostly in the form of pneumonia, are the leading cause of death in children under five years of age living in low‐income countries. Vitamin A supplementation has been found to reduce mortality and the severity of respiratory infections in children with measles. This updated review was undertaken to assess the effectiveness of vitamin A adjunctive therapy in children with non‐measles respiratory infections, particularly pneumonia. 
We found six trials (1740 participants) that used vitamin A adjunctive therapy in children with non‐measles pneumonia. There was no significant reduction in mortality or duration of hospital stay. Supplementary high‐dose vitamin A may result in a worsening of the disease, and low‐dose vitamin A significantly reduces the recurrence of bronchopneumonia. Moderate‐dose vitamin A significantly reduces the time to remission of signs in children with normal serum retinol. The possible reason of the lack of benefit of vitamin A in non‐measles pneumonia is that the effects of vitamin A may be disease‐specific, with vitamin A only being effective when pneumonia is complicated with measles. Further high‐quality research is required.
