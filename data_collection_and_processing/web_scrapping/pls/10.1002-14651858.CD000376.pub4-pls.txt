Long chain polyunsaturated fatty acid supplementation in infants born at term
Review question: Does feeding full‐term babies with formula milk enriched with long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCPUFA) result in improved vision and overall neurodevelopment compared with feeding formula milk not enriched with LCPUFA? 
Background: LCPUFA is a type of fat that is essential for the development of brain and vision in newborn babies. Breast milk contains adequate amounts of LCPUFA and hence is considered better than formula milk. Some milk formulae with added LCPUFA are commercially available. 
Study characteristics: This review analysed studies that compared outcomes of full‐term babies (born at ≥ 37 weeks of pregnancy) who were given formula milk enriched with LCPUFA versus outcomes of full‐term babies fed formula milk without enrichment with LCPUFA. 
Key results: Review authors found that full‐term babies fed formula milk supplemented with LCPUFA did not have better outcomes than were reported for full‐term babies fed formula milk without LCPUFA. 
Quality of evidence: We considered the overall quality of evidence to be low.
