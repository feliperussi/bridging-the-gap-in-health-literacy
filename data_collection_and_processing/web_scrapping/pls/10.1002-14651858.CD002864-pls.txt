Intravenous prostaglandin for induction of labour
Inducing labour with intravenous prostaglandin is effective but has adverse effects. Induction of labour is common when continuing the pregnancy poses a greater risk to the mother or her unborn child. Prostaglandins, produced naturally by the body, can ripen the cervix and stimulate contractions. This review found that giving prostaglandins intravenously during the third trimester of pregnancy is effective in inducing labour, but is more expensive and causes more adverse effects than oxytocin (another hormone for inducing labour).
