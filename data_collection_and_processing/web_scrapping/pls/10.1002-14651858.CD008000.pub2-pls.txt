Rheum officinale (a traditional Chinese medicine) for the treatment of chronic kidney disease 
Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a long‐term, life threatening illness that is becoming more common. People who have CKD are monitored closely and treated with therapies that are determined according to the stage of their illness and whether they have other health problems. Treatment for CKD often involves drugs to control blood pressure and aid kidney function ‐ often angiotensin‐converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) ‐ along with restricting the amount of protein consumed. Practitioners of traditional Chinese medicine often use Rheum officinale (Da Huang, a type of rhubarb) to treat people with CKD. 
We analysed evidence from nine studies conducted in China that compared Rheum officinale with no treatment or treatment with captopril, an ACEi. We looked at reported changes in two important blood markers ‐ serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen ‐ that indicate progression of CKD. 
We found no high quality evidence to indicate that treatment with Rheum officinale can improve CKD or delay its progression. Rheum officinale was not found to cause any serious health problems in patients with CKD. Well‐designed randomised controlled studies are needed to provide robust, high quality evidence to assess if there are benefits from Rheum officinale for people with CKD.
