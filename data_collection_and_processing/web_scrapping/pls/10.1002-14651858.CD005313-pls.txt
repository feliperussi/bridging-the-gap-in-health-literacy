In people who have had a heart attack because of blocked heart arteries insertion of thin metal tubes (stents) were better than using small balloons to open the arteries up again 
Arteries can become clogged and narrowed with deposits of fat, cholesterol and other substances. This is called atherosclerosis and can cause heart attack. Two methods to open narrowed or clogged arteries in people who have had a recent heart attack are inserting a deflated small balloon in the artery and expand it to open the vessel (balloon angioplasty) or to insert a thin metal tube or sleeve (stent) into the artery to scaffold the artery open. This review compared these treatments and found both were equally effective at preventing death but using stents was better than balloon angioplasty because fewer arteries needed to be re‚Äêcleared and stents prevented more heart attacks than balloon angioplasty.
