Laparoscopic (minimally invasive) repair for perforated peptic ulcer disease
A perforated peptic ulcer can be repaired using either open surgery or laparoscopy, a minimally invasive surgical technique sometimes known as 'keyhole' surgery. Three randomized controlled trials were identified that compared the two methods. These trials included patients with clinical suspicion of perforated peptic ulcer that was confirmed at surgery. Both laparoscopic and open repairs were made with an omentum patch or fibrin sealant. The primary outcomes assessed were septic abdominal and extra‚Äêabdominal complications. Secondary outcomes assessed were mortality, operation time and hospital length of stay. The quality of the trials was acceptable. There were no statistically significant differences in septic abdominal complications between laparoscopic and open repair of perforated peptic ulcer. More randomized controlled trials with a greater number of patients are needed to confirm such an assumption, guaranteeing a long learning curve for participating surgeons.
