Antibiotic use before amniotomy (artificially rupturing the membranes) for reducing infections in mother and infant 
The artificial rupture of the membranes (amniotomy) is a common obstetrical procedure. It may be done to either initiate or to augment labour, with or without oxytocin. This invasive procedure allows vaginal micro‐organisms access into the uterine cavity, which can in turn lead to infections in both the mother and the infant. A greater time interval between rupture of membranes and delivery, as with induction of labour, increases the chances of an infection. 
The purpose of this review was to evaluate the routine use of antibiotics immediately prior to amniotomy for both initiation and augmentation of labour using randomised controlled trials. However, our search only identified one trial which did not meet the inclusion criteria for this review. 
Consequently, there is no evidence to support or refute the routine use of antibiotics prior to amniotomy. Randomised controlled trials on this topic are needed, especially in resource‐constrained settings where amniotomy is still used as a means of inducing labour, to evaluate the routine use of antibiotics at amniotomy in such settings. Future research in this area should also consider cost effectiveness and side effects of antibiotic use including the emergence of antibiotic‐resistant strains.
