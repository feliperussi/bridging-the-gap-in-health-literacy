Postnatal phenobarbital for the prevention of intraventricular haemorrhage in preterm infants 
Large bleeds in the centre of the brain can cause disability or death in preterm babies. Unstable blood pressure and blood flow to the brain are believed to cause intraventricular haemorrhage (IVH) (bleeding into the fluid‚Äêfilled cavities of the brain (ventricles). The drug phenobarbital is believed to stabilise blood pressure and, therefore, potentially help prevent IVH. The review of trials found that there was not enough evidence that postnatal phenobarbital is effective in preventing IVH. Furthermore, phenobarbital suppresses breathing in infants who are breathing spontaneously, causing a need for mechanical ventilation.
