Family‐based alcohol misuse prevention for young people can be effective
We conducted a Cochrane systematic review of 12 randomised controlled trials that examined the effectiveness of family‐based universal programs for the prevention of alcohol misuse in young people. In family settings, universal prevention typically takes the form of supporting the development of parenting skills including parental support, nurturing behaviours, establishing clear boundaries or rules, and parental monitoring. Social and peer resistance skills, the development of behavioural norms and positive peer affiliations can also be addressed with a universal family‐based preventive program. 
Most of the studies included in this review reported positive effects of family‐based universal programs for the prevention of alcohol misuse in young people. Two studies, each with a large sample size, reported no effects. In conclusion, in this Cochrane systematic review we found that that the effects of family‐based prevention interventions are small but generally consistent and also persistent into the medium‐ to longer‐term.
