Alternative materials injected into the vocal fold (cord) for unilateral vocal fold paralysis 
Paralysis of one of the vocal folds (vocal cords) can have a significant impact upon a patient's quality of life. The affected patient may suffer with poor voice, breathlessness and problems with their swallowing. The treatment options include voice therapy, injection to the vocal cord or open surgery. The injection of a material into the affected vocal fold aims to improve voice, breathlessness and prevent episodes of aspiration (choking). There are a wide variety of injectable materials available and this review aimed to assess their effectiveness. 
Our systematic review of the relevant literature could not identify any randomised controlled trials of sufficient quality to include in this review. There is currently insufficient high‐quality evidence to support the effectiveness of any particular injectable material. Further, well‐designed, robust research is required in this area.
