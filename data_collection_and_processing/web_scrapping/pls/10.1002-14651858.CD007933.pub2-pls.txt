Genital ulcer disease treatment for reducing sexual acquisition of HIV
The presence of a genital ulcer would provide an entry point for the HIV virus if an HIV‐negative individual with an ulcer has unprotected sexual intercourse with an HIV‐infected person. Treatment of the condition causing the genital ulcer would allow the ulcer to heal and therefore reduce the chances of HIV acquisition. This review assessed whether giving treatment for diseases that present with ulcers in the genital region would reduce sexual acquisition of HIV. Three studies were identified involving 173 HIV‐negative patients with genital ulcers. These studies did not provide sufficient evidence that treatment of genital ulcer diseases reduces sexual acquisition of HIV infection. However, genital ulcer diseases are public health problems in their own right and patients with these conditions should be treated appropriately; whether the treatment reduces the risk of HIV infection or not.
