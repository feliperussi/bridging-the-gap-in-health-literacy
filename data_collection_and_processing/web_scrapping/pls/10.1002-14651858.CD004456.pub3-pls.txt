Home visits during pregnancy and after birth for women with an alcohol or drug problem
Not enough information on home visiting in pregnancy and after the birth for women with an alcohol or drug problem. 
Women with an alcohol or drug problem in pregnancy are at increased risk of miscarriage, low birthweight babies, infections and postnatal depression, and the babies of withdrawal symptoms or impaired development. Home visits by individuals, teams of health professionals or trained lay people are aimed at improving health and social outcomes for mothers and babies. The review of seven trials, 803 women, found evidence that home visits after the birth may increase the engagement of these women in drug treatment services and their use of contraception, but there were insufficient data to say if this improved the health of the baby or mother. Further research is needed, with visits starting during pregnancy.
