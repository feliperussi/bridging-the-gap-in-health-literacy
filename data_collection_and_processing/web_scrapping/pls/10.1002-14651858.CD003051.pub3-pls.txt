The use of sealants after lung cancer resection reduce postoperative air leaks and, in many cases, the length of hospitalization 
Air leak (air coming out of the remaining lung tissue) after lung removal for lung cancer is a common postoperative complication that prolongs hospital stay. Surgical sealants (glue), synthetic or made from blood products, have been developed to prevent or to reduce the incidence of air leaks. They are applied during the operation over the lung surfaces that show air leaks. This review of randomized trials found that the use of surgical sealants seems to reduce postoperative air leaks and length of hospitalization. Nevertheless, more and larger randomized trials are needed to clearly determine the effects of surgical sealants, especially on length of hospitalization.
