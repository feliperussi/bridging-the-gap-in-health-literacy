Can community interventions reduce smoking among adults
Although intervention communities often showed substantial awareness of their programme, this rarely led to higher quit rates. Similarly, increased knowledge of health risks, changes in attitudes to smoking, more quit attempts, and better environmental and social support for quitting were not accompanied by reductions in community smoking levels. In the best designed trials, light to moderate smokers did slightly better than heavy smokers (the US COMMIT study), and men did a little better than women (the Australian CART study), but overall smoking rates remained similar between intervention and control communities.
