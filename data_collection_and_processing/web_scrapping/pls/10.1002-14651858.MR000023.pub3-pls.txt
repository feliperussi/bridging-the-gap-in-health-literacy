When and how to update systematic reviews
Systematic reviews are most useful when they are regularly updated. It is not clear, however, when updating should be done and which strategies and methods are most cost‚ÄêeffectiveThis review identified strategies and methods used to update systematic reviews. Fifteen articles that documented 4 strategies and 2 statistical methods for updating systematic reviews were found. The 4 strategies have not been compared to one another so their practical performances are unclear. 
Little research has been conducted on when and how to update systematic reviews and the feasibility and efficiency of the identified approaches is uncertain. These shortcomings should be addressed in future research.
