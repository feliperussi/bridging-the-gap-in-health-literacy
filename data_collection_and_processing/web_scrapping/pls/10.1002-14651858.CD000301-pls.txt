Corticosteroids for maintenance of remission in Crohn's disease
The use of corticosteroids among patients with non‐active Crohn's disease does not appear to be effective in reducing the risk of disease recurrence over a 24 month period. Side effects associated with the long term use of corticosteroids include osteoporosis and cataracts. There may be subgroups of patients who would benefit from low dose corticosteroids but the long‐term effectiveness of this type of treatment has not been studied.
