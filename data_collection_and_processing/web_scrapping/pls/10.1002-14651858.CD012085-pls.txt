Motor control exercise for acute non‐specific low back pain
Review question 
To evaluate the effectiveness of motor control exercise (MCE) for patients with acute non‐specific low back pain (LBP). 
Background 
LBP is a common disorder that is often associated with pain and disability. One common intervention for patients with LBP is exercise therapy, and MCE is widely used for these patients. However, its effectiveness for patients with acute LBP remains unclear. 
Search date 
Evidence is current to April 2015.
Study characteristics 
We included in this review three trials evaluating acute or subacute pain in patients with LBP (n = 197 participants). Most participants were middle‐aged and were recruited from primary or tertiary care centres. Duration of treatment programmes ranged from four weeks to six weeks. 
Key results 
MCE showed no benefit over spinal manipulative therapy, other forms of exercise or medical treatment for reducing pain or disability among patients with acute and subacute LBP. Whether MCE can prevent recurrences of LBP remains unclear. 
Quality of the evidence 
Results of this review include evidence of very low to moderate quality. We downgraded all comparisons for imprecision due to small study sample sizes.
