Acyclovir can reduce the number of days with fever in otherwise healthy children with chickenpox, but its effect on sores and itching is not yet certain 
Chickenpox (varicella) is caused by a virus. It begins with a fever, followed by a rash of red pimples which become itchy sores that form scabs. Chickenpox usually affects children from one to 14 years. In young babies, adults or people with impaired immune system, chickenpox is more severe. Treatments include lotions to relieve itchiness, paracetamol (acetaminophen) for fever and the antiviral drug acyclovir. The review of trials found that acyclovir reduces the number of days of fever from chickenpox in otherwise healthy children, usually without adverse effects. It is not clear whether it improves sores and itching.
