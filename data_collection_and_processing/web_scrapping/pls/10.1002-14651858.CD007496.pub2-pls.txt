Male circumcision for prevention of homosexual acquisition of HIV in men
At present there is no completed randomised controlled trial that has assessed the effects of male circumcision on acquisition of HIV and other sexually transmitted infections among men who have sex with men (MSM). Results from observational studies suggest that circumcision may be protective among MSM who practice primarily insertive anal sex, but the role of male circumcision overall in the prevention of HIV and other sexually transmitted infections among MSM remains to be determined.
