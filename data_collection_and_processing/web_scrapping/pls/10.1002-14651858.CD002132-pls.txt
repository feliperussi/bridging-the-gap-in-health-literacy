Low molecular weight heparins reduce the number of heart attacks and cause fewer complications after an acute coronary syndrome compared to unfractionated heparin 
Blood clots in the arteries leading to the heart can cause acute coronary syndrome: unstable angina (a feeling of tightness in the chest) or a type of heart attack. Drugs that dissolve clots (such as aspirin) or thin the blood (such as heparin) can relieve the problem. Unfractionated heparin (UFH) thins the blood, but can cause a serious but rare adverse effect. Low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) is a new type of heparin. The review of trials found that UFH and LMWH were equally effective in preventing death, but LMWH prevented more heart attacks and caused fewer complications.
