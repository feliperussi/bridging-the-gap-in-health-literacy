Progestagens and anti‐progestagens for pain associated with endometriosis
Endometriosis is a painful condition where tissue from the lining of the womb (uterus) is found outside the uterus as well. It can cause pain in the abdomen, generally and during periods (menstruation) or sex. Endometriosis can also lead to infertility. Treatments include surgery or drugs to try and shrink the tissue. Progestagens and anti‐progestagens are some of the hormonal drugs used for treatment. This systematic review of trials found limited evidence for the effectiveness of these drugs in the reduction of pain from endometriosis. This was due to the limited number of randomised controlled trials comparing each drug.
