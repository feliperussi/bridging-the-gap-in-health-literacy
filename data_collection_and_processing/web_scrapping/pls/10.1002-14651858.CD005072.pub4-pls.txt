Use of a levonorgestrel‐releasing intrauterine device (LNG‐IUD) for reducing pain in women who have had surgery for endometriosis 
What is endometriosis? 
Endometriosis is a chronic pain syndrome associated with the presence of endometrial (womb‐like) tissue outside the womb, usually in the pelvis, that can lead to infertility and pelvic pain (pain below the belly button). 
How is endometriosis treated? 
Endometriosis is usually managed with hormonal medications, surgery, or a combination of both. The progestogen levonorgestrel is one such hormonal medication that is believed to stop the growth of endometrial tissue outside the womb. 
What is the aim of the review? 
The aim of this review was to assess whether the use of a LNG‐IUD was beneficial for managing associated painful symptoms and improving the quality of life and patient satisfaction in women who have recently had surgery for endometriosis. 
What did the review find? 
At this stage, there is not enough evidence to support the use of LNG‐IUD after surgery to reduce pain caused by endometriosis.  Although there was some evidence of a benefit in reducing painful periods and improving quality of life and satisfaction when using LNG‐IUD after surgery, the certainty of evidence was low to very low, due to the small numbers of studies and study participants, as well as flaws in study design. This suggests that further studies are required before a recommendation can be made for its use.
