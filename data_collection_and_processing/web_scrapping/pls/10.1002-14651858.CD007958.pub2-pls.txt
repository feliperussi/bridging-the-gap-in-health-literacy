Angiogenesis‐inhibitors for metastatic thyroid cancer
There is currently no reliable evidence from randomized controlled trials demonstrating that the beneﬁts of angiogenesis‐inhibitors outweigh their risks in treating advanced thyroid cancer. Angiogenesis (that is blood supply of tumors and new blood vessel formation in tumors) plays an important role in tumor growth and metastasis. Currently, four randomized controlled trials are ongoing. Despite the potential beneﬁts of angiogenesis‐inhibitors, various undesirable side effects have been reported. These include rash, diarrhea, fatigue, nausea, proteinuria, stomatitis or mucositis, and hypertension. We will update this review as data from the ongoing trial become available.
