Feeding by tube into the stomach or intestine versus feeding by mouth for children with cerebral palsy 
Children with cerebral palsy can have problems with sucking, chewing and swallowing. This can make it difficult to eat and lead eventually to undernutrition or problems caused by food going down the wrong way and getting into the lungs. Mealtimes may be long and distressing for the child and for their carer. Increasingly, feeding by a surgically‐inserted tube into the stomach (gastrostomy) or via a tube inserted into the middle of the small intestine (jejunostomy) is used to provide such children with nutrition. These processes can be costly, as well as being emotionally difficult for families, and complications are possible. We searched 12 databases in July 2012 but did not find any studies that randomly put children into two groups to investigate the effects of tube feeding via gastrostomy (or jejunostomy) compared to feeding by mouth only. Well‐designed studies are needed to help medical professionals and families make difficult decisions about how to treat children with cerebral palsy and physical difficulties in eating.
