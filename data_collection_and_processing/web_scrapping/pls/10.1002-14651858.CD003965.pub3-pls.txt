Immunosuppressive agents for treating IgA nephropathy
What is the issue? IgA nephropathy is a common kidney disease that often leads to decreased kidney function and may result ultimately in kidney failure for one‚Äêthird of affected people. The cause of IgA nephropathy is not known, although most people with the disease have abnormalities in their immune system. 
What did we do? We searched for all the research trials that assessed the effect of immunosuppressive therapy in people with IgA nephropathy in September 2019. We measured the certainty we could have about the treatments using a system called "GRADE". 
What did we find? We found 58 studies involving 3933 adults and children who were treated with immunosuppressive therapy. Patients in the studies were given either steroids or other forms of therapy to reduce the actions of their immune system. The treatment they got was decided by random chance. Steroid therapy taken for 2 to 4 months appeared to slow damage to the kidney and probably prevents patients from developing kidney failure. It is really uncertain whether steroids cause side effects such as serious infection. One study was stopped early because patients who received steroid therapy had more infections than those patients who were given placebo. Other medications like cyclophosphamide, azathioprine, and mycophenolate mofetil did not clearly protect kidney function in people with IgA nephropathy. 
Conclusions 
Steroid therapy may prevent kidney failure in IgA nephropathy but the risks of serious infections are uncertain with treatment.
