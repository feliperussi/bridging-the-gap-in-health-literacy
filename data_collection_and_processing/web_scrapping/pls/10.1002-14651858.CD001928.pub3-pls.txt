Calcium antagonists for acute ischemic stroke
Question 
Are calcium antagonist drugs beneficial for people who have had an acute ischemic stroke?  Background Most strokes are due to reduced blood flow with obstruction of large and small arteries. As a result, calcium ions flood into the brain cells and contribute to brain cell death. Calcium antagonists may reduce the damage by preventing the influx of calcium ions. In the past 20 years, there have been many clinical trials focusing on various calcium antagonists for acute ischemic stroke. We reviewed the evidence about the effects of these medicines compared with placebo or control in people with acute ischemic stroke.  Study characteristics We identified 34 studies to February 6, 2018 that met our inclusion criteria; they involved 7731 participants and investigated different kinds of drugs. Twenty‐six trials tested nimodipine, and three trials assessed flunarizine. One trial each used isradipine, nicardipine, PY108‐608, fasudil, and lifarizine.  Key results There was no difference in deaths or dependency between participants who received calcium antagonists or not.  Quality of the evidence There is no evidence that calcium antagonists after acute ischemic stroke could save lives or reduce disability. The evidence was moderately reliable, which means that further research is unlikely to change our conclusions.
