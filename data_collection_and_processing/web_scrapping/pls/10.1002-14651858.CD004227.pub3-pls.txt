Antioxidants for preventing pre‐eclampsia
Pre‐eclampsia can occur during pregnancy when women have high blood pressure and protein in their urine. In some cases, it can lead to poor growth for the baby and premature birth. There can also be serious complications for the woman, sometimes affecting the liver, kidneys, brain or blood clotting system. Both mother and baby are at risk of mortality. A possible contributing factor to the development of pre‐eclampsia may be the presence of excessive amounts of chemicals called 'free radicals'. Antioxidants, such as vitamin C, vitamin E, selenium and lycopene, can neutralize free radicals. The review covered 10 trials, involving 6533 women, and looked at several antioxidants. Overall the review found no reduction in pre‐eclampsia, high blood pressure or preterm birth with the use of antioxidant supplements. When antioxidants were assessed separately, there were insufficient data to be clear about whether there was any benefit or not, except for vitamin C and E. The current evidence does not support the use of antioxidants to reduce the risk of pre‐eclampsia or other complications in pregnancy, but there are trials still in progress.
