Effects of memory training in healthy older adults and older adults with mild cognitive impairment 
There is an increasing interest in information on the effectiveness of cognitive training interventions to improve memory in normal and mildly cognitively impaired older adults (60 years and older). We analyzed all cognitive interventions between 1970 and 2007 to determine their effectiveness. The results suggest that cognitive interventions do lead to performance improvements and that the size of the effects differs for different kinds of memory skills in healthy older adults and people with mild cognitive impairment. In particular, immediate and delayed verbal recall improved significantly through training compared to a no‚Äêtreatment control condition but the improvements observed did not exceed the improvement in the active control conditions.
