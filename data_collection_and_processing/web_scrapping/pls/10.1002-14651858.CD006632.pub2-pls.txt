Clinical pathways in hospitals.
Decision‐making in hospitals has evolved from being opinion‐based to being based on sound scientific evidence. This decision‐making is recognised as evidence‐based practice. Perpetual publication of new evidence combined with the demands of every‐day practice makes it difficult for health professionals to keep up to date. Clinical pathways are document‐based tools that provide a link between the best available evidence and clinical practice. They provide recommendations, processes and time‐frames for the management of specific medical conditions or interventions. Clinical pathways have been implemented worldwide but the evidence about their impact from single trials is contradictory. This review aimed to summarise the evidence and assess the effect of clinical pathways on professional practice (e.g. quality of documentation), patient outcomes (e.g. mortality, complications), length of hospital stay and hospital costs. 
Twenty‐seven studies involving 11,398 participants were included for analysis. The main results were a reduction in in‐hospital complications and improved documentation associated with clinical pathways. Complications assessed included wound infections, bleeding and pneumonia. Most studies reported a decreased length of stay and reduction in hospital costs when clinical pathways were implemented. Considerable variation in study design and settings prevented statistical pooling of results for length of stay and hospital costs. Generally poor reporting prevented the identification of characteristics common to successful clinical pathways. 
The authors concluded that clinical pathways are associated with reduced in‐hospital complications
