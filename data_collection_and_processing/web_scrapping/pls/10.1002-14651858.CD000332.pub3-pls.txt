Erythropoiesis‐stimulating agents for anemia in rheumatoid arthritis
Researchers in the Cochrane Collaboration conducted a review of the effect of erythropoiesis‐stimulating agents for anemia in patients with rheumatoid arthritis.  After searching for all relevant studies, they found three studies covering 133 people. Their findings are summarised below: 
The review shows that in people with anemia and rheumatoid arthritis:
‐ it is uncertain whether erythropoiesis‐stimulating agents improve quality of life or hemoglobin levels. ‐ it is unknown whether erythropoiesis‐stimulating agents improve fatigue, as this was not measured by the studies. 
We do not have precise information about side effects and complications. This is particularly true for rare but serious side effects, which may include thromboembolic complications.  
What is anemia in rheumatoid arthritis and what are erythropoiesis‐stimulating agents?  
When you have rheumatoid arthritis, your immune system, which normally fights infection, attacks the lining of your joints. This makes them swollen, stiff and painful. The small joints of the hands and feet are usually affected first.  As the disease progresses, other complications may appear, including anemia (low hemoglobin level). Hemoglobin is a protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen.  Anemia is a condition in which the body does not have enough healthy red blood cells.  Erythropoietin is a hormone produced in the kidney, which increases the production of red blood cells. Erythropoiesis‐stimulating agents work to increase red blood cell production.
