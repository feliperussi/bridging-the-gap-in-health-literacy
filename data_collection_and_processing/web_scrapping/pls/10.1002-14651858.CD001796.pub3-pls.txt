Aerobic exercise for adults living with HIV/AIDS
Performing aerobic exercise or a combination of aerobic exercise and resistive exercise for at least 20 minutes, at least three times per week for at least five weeks appears to be safe and may improve fitness, body composition, and well‐being for adults living with HIV. 
Exercise is used by many people living with HIV to improve fitness, well‐being, and body image. Exercise also is used as a strategy to diminish the health‐related consequences of HIV and associated treatments. This review of 14 trials found that performing constant or interval aerobic exercise, or a combination of constant aerobic exercise and progressive resistive exercise, for at least 20 minutes, three times per week for at least five weeks appears to be safe and may be able to improve fitness, body composition, and well‐being for adults living with HIV. More high‐quality studies are needed to better evaluate the evidence on under‐represented groups, such as women and older adults living with HIV, and those who discontinue their exercise programs.
