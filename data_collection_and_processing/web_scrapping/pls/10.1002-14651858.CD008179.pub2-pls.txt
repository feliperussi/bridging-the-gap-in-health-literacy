Services to help people who look after or provide help and support to stroke survivors
People who look after or provide help and support to stroke survivors have a very important part in the life of a stroke survivor. However, looking after or giving help and support to a stroke survivor can affect the health and well‚Äêbeing of the person who is the main carer. Therefore, it is important that health and social care professionals, policy makers and, more importantly, carers of stroke survivors and stroke survivors are aware of what educational, respite or other type of services might help carers. Based on the results of this review, which included eight studies involving 1007 participants, there is currently not enough information available to help us work out what services might be best for informal caregivers of stroke survivors. However, another 11 studies are currently underway, which may help us find out what works best.
