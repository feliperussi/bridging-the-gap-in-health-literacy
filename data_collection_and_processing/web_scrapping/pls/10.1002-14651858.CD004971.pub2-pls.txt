Different types of powered toothbrushes for plaque control and healthy gums
Powered brushes were first introduced commercially in the 1960s. A previously published Cochrane systematic review suggested one type of powered brush was superior to manual toothbrushing for the removal of plaque and reduction of gum inflammation.That review did not allow direct comparison between the different types of powered toothbrushes. 
This review included data from 17 trials with 1369 participants. Brushes with a rotation oscillation action reduced plaque and gingivitis more than those with a side to side action in the short term. However, the difference was small and it's clinical importance unclear. Due to the low numbers of trials using other types of powered brushes, no other definitive conclusions can be drawn regarding the superiority of one type of powered toothbrush over another. Only minor and transient side effects were reported. Cost and reliability of the brushes were not reported in the trials. 
Further trials of good quality are required to establish if other types of powered brush are better at reducing plaque and gingivitis.
