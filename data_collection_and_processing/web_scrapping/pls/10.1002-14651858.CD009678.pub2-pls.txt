Nutritional interventions for survivors of childhood cancer
Background 
Survivors of childhood cancer are at a higher risk of chronic health conditions such as, osteoporosis, metabolic syndrome (including obesity and type II diabetes), and cardiovascular disease. These diseases have the potential to be reduced or prevented with targeted nutritional interventions. 
Objective 
This review looks at three randomised controlled trials that studied the effects of interventions designed to improve the dietary intake of children who have completed treatment for cancer. 
Study Characteristics 
The three studies included 616 participants who had completed their therapy for childhood cancer. All of the participants were less than 21 years of age at study entry. The interventions ranged from the promotion of health behaviours to vitamin and mineral supplementation. The follow‐up ranged from one month to 36 months from the initial assessment. 
Key results 
There was low quality evidence that those who received a health behaviour intervention decreased their self‐reported intake of “junk food”. They also increased their intake of dairy foods, as well as increasing their calcium supplementation. The interventions did not appear to translate to an improvement in their dietary intake, body composition, or bone mineral density. 
Quality of the evidence 
The results from this review do not provide enough evidence regarding the effectiveness of nutritional interventions for childhood cancer survivors. There was low quality evidence overall. Further well designed research is needed in this area.
