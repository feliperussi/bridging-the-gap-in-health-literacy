No evidence to show whether removing nail polish and finger rings prevents wound infection after surgery 
People having surgery can get a serious wound infection from bacteria (germs) on the hands of operating theatre staff (doctors, nurses, and assistants). Theatre staff scrub their hands intensively before operations to reduce the number of bacteria on them. It may be that nail polish (varnish) and rings (jewellery) hide bacteria and reduce the effectiveness of hand scrubbing. This review could not locate any trials that investigated the effect of theatre staff wearing rings, but did find one small trial that investigated the number of bacteria before and after scrubbing on the hands of theatre staff with varnished and unvarnished nails. This trial did not identify any clear differences between the number of bacteria on varnished and unvarnished nails, but evidence from more trials is required before we can be certain that this is a true result.
