Paliperidone palmitate for schizophrenia
Paliperidone palmitate is a long‐acting intramuscular formulation of paliperidone, an active metabolite of risperidone that was previously available only in an oral formulation. We evaluated the efficacy, adverse effects, and safety of paliperidone palmitate in the treatment of people with schizophrenia and schizophrenia‐like illnesses. In short‐term studies, paliperidone palmitate is a more effective antipsychotic than placebo. The adverse effects of paliperidone palmitate are similar to those of oral paliperidone, oral risperidone, and risperidone long‐acting injection. In two short‐term studies, flexibly‐dosed paliperidone palmitate is roughly equivalent in efficacy and tolerability to flexibly‐dosed risperidone long‐acting injection.
