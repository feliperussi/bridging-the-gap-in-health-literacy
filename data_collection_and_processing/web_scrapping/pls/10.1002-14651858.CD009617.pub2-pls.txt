Anti‐D administration after spontaneous miscarriage for preventing Rhesus alloimmunisation
A Rhesus‐negative (Rh‐negative) pregnant woman might develop Rh antibodies in her blood stream when she carries a Rh‐positive baby. The subsequent antibody formation has the potential to attack the red blood cells of a Rh‐positive baby during pregnancy. This might make the baby anaemic and in severe cases, the baby might die. Other Cochrane reviews provide clear evidence that giving anti‐D immunoglobulin (anti‐D) within 72 hours of the birth to a Rh‐negative mother of a Rh‐positive baby and during the third trimester reduces Rh antibody formation in future pregnancies. The chances of developing Rh antibodies may also be reduced if anti‐D is given to Rh‐negative women following a spontaneous miscarriage or a dilatation & curettage (D&C) for incomplete miscarriage after 12 weeks. However, our review only identified one poor quality randomised controlled trial (involving 48 women) that considered anti‐D administration after therapeutic D&C or spontaneous miscarriage for preventing Rh alloimmunisation (development of antibodies in response to antigens from a non‐self protein). The included study did not report any data on the review's primary or secondary outcomes. More high‐quality research is needed in this field.
