Electrical stimulation of nerves with permanently implanted devices for adults with abnormal urine storage or voiding 
Many people have urinary problems that are difficult to control by non‐surgical means. Most surgical treatments are for people with stress incontinence only. Implants that provide continuous electrical stimulation to the nerves that control the bladder have been used in people with other types of incontinence. These devices are expensive, the surgery is invasive, and many people need another operation. It is not clear how best to use these devices. However, implantable stimulators that provide continuous electrical stimulation to the nerves or nerve roots supplying the bladder and pelvis, or to the peripheral nerves that share the same nerve roots, can benefit carefully selected patients with difficult‐to‐control urinary problems.
