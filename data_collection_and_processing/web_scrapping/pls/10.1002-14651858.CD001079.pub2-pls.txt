Prophylactic protein free synthetic surfactant for preventing morbidity and mortality in preterm infants 
Pulmonary surfactant is a substance that prevents the air sacs of the lungs from collapsing by reducing surface tension. Surfactant is essential to normal lung function in newborn babies. Sometimes it is absent in immature lungs and respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) can develop. Protein free synthetic surfactants have been developed and can be used for babies born prematurely (before 34 weeks) who are at risk of developing RDS. The review of trials found evidence that synthetic surfactant reduced the risk of RDS in babies considered at risk. Babies who receive prophylactic synthetic surfactant have a decreased risk of RDS, pneumothorax (air in the lung cavity) and death. However, babies who receive prophylactic synthetic surfactant have an increased risk of developing lung hemorrhage and patent ductus arteriosus, an open vessel that channels blood from the lungs to the body. Although this can lead to potentially life threatening complications, the overall benefits of surfactant treatment outweigh the risks.
