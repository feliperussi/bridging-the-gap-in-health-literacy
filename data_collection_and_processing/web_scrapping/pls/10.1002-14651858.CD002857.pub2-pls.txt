Uterine muscle relaxant drugs for threatened miscarriage
Not enough evidence to say if drugs that relax the muscles of the uterus can prevent threatened miscarriage. 
Miscarriage is the loss of a baby in the very early weeks of pregnancy (before 20 weeks), before the baby would be able to survive on its own. This can be a devastating loss to expectant parents. Threatened miscarriage is when there is vaginal bleeding, and sometimes pain, but when the cervix remains closed. The review of studies found just one small trial on uterine relaxant drugs to prevent miscarriage, but the study provided insufficient data to be able to assess its effect adequately. More research is needed.
