Restricted versus liberal water intake for preventing morbidity and mortality in preterm infants 
Most babies born before 37 weeks of pregnancy (preterm babies) are not developed enough to take all the water and nutrients they need by mouth. As a result, they are unable to regulate their intake of water. Inadequate water intake can cause the baby to become dehydrated. Excessive water intake can cause heart and lung problems or intestinal damage. Systematic review of trials related to this issue leads to the conclusion that careful restriction of water for preterm babies, to amounts that meet their physical needs without causing dehydration, reduces the risk of certain complications. More research on this topic is needed.
