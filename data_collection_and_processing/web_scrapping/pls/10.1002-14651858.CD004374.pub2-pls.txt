Short term urinary catheter policies following urogenital surgery in adults
Urinary catheters are often used after urological or gynaecological surgery to check on urine output, to allow patients to pass urine, to allow washing out of the bladder and to help tissues heal. They can be inserted via the urethra (tube between the bladder and the outside) or suprapubically (through the abdomen). Different designs or materials may be used for the catheters, and different ways of managing the catheters and their removal are available. This review assesses the evidence for these options.   Five trials suggested that it might be better to use a catheter after surgery than not to use one as fewer people needed to be re‐catheterised if a catheter was used at first. Information from six trials suggested that fewer people needed to be re‐catheterised for urinary retention if a suprapubic catheter was used instead of a urethral one. People in up to 11 trials had fewer urinary tract infections if the catheters were removed sooner rather than later.   Although 39 trials were included in the review in total, the evidence in general was poor and came from small studies, which often did not provide enough information to draw firm conclusions. Much larger trials with many more participants must be conducted.
