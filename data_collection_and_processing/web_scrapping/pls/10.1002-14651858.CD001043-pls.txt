Herbal medicines containing beta‐sitosterols may help to relieve the urinary symptoms and urinary flow problems caused by an enlarged prostate gland (benign prostatic hyperplasia) 
Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), enlargement of the prostate gland, is common in older men. An enlarged prostate can interfere with urination, increasing the frequency and urge, or causing problems emptying the bladder. Both surgery and drugs are used to try to treat BPH. However, using herbal medicines to try to relieve the symptoms of BPH is becoming common. One popular herbal treatment for BPH contains active ingredients called beta‐sitosterols. The review found that beta‐sitosterol treatments were well tolerated and improved urinary symptoms and flow measures in men with mild to moderate BPH. More research into long‐term effects of beta‐sitosterols is needed.
