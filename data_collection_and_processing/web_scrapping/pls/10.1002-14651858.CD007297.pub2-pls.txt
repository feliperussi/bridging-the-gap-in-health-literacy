Shared decision making interventions for people with mental health conditions
Mental health conditions are common and can have serious consequences for both affected individuals and society. Current clinical guidance encourages mental healthcare practitioners to involve patients in treatment decisions. This is advocated on the basis that people have a right to self‐determination and also in the expectation that it will increase treatment adherence. 
We conducted thorough searches for randomised controlled trials (RCTs), quasi‐randomised controlled trials (q‐RCTs), controlled before‐and‐after studies (CBAs); and interrupted time series (ITS) studies of interventions to increase shared decision making in people with mental health conditions. We found two studies that met the inclusion criteria. Both studies were of good quality and made attempts to reduce potential sources of bias. 
We examined whether interventions to increase shared decision making affected patient satisfaction with treatment or care, led to better health outcomes or to patients being less likely to be readmitted to hospital. One of the studies indicated that the intervention increased patient satisfaction in the short term. One study indicated that doctor facilitation of consumer involvement in decision making was increased by the intervention, but no effects were found on the clinical or health service outcomes in either study. Neither study reported that shared decision making for people with mental health conditions is harmful. However, no firm conclusions can be drawn from these two studies on any of the outcomes measured and further research is needed.
