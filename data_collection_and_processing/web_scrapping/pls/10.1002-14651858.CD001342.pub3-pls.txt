Vitamin K antagonists versus antiplatelet therapy after transient ischaemic attack or minor ischaemic stroke of presumed arterial origin 
People who have a stroke due to a blockage of an artery have a higher risk of having another possibly fatal stroke, or a heart attack. Treatment with antiplatelet drugs (like aspirin) definitely reduces this risk. Blood thinning treatment (anticoagulation by vitamin K antagonists) was believed to provide added protection. We reviewed eight trials involving 5762 participants that compared anticoagulants with antiplatelet agents for preventing recurrent stroke and found no benefit of low intensity anticoagulation over aspirin, and an increased risk of bleeding with high intensity anticoagulation.
