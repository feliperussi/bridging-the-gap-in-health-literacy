Prophylactic antibiotics to reduce the risk of urinary tract infections after urodynamic studies 
Urodynamics is an invasive test which involves inserting a catheter into the bladder in order to help with diagnosis of bladder symptoms. It carries the risk of causing a urinary tract infection. We need to balance the risk of a urinary tract infection and the symptoms associated with such an infection (such as fever, pain passing urine) against the risk and cost of giving prophylactic antibiotics. Some people also pick up an increased number of bacteria in the urine but do not develop the signs of an infection (asymptomatic bacteriuria). We looked at the use of prophylactic antibiotics for the prevention of urinary tract infections and bacteriuria. We identified nine trials including 973 people. We found that people were less likely to have bacteria in their urine after urodynamic studies if they had antibiotics (4% versus 12%). While they did have fewer urinary tract infections (20% compared with 28% with no antibiotics), this did not reach statistical significance. There were too few adverse effects, such as fever, pain when passing urine or a reaction to the antibiotics, for the findings to be reliable. However, people were less likely to have blood in their urine with antibiotics. There was no information about other treatments which might help reduce infections, nor about different doses or types of antibiotics.
