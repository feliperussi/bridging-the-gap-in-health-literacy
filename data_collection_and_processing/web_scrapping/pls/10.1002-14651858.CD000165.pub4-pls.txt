Does advice from doctors encourage people who smoke to quit
Advice from doctors helps people who smoke to quit. Even when doctors provide brief simple advice about quitting smoking this increases the likelihood that someone who smokes will successfully quit and remain a nonsmoker 12 months later. More intensive advice may result in slightly higher rates of quitting. Providing follow‚Äêup support after offering the advice may increase the quit rates slightly.
