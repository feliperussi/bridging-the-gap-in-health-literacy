Education programmes for people with diabetic kidney disease
Adherence to complex regimens is often poor in patients with diabetes and chronic kidney disease (DKD). Interventions to enhance adherence require both intensive education and behavioural counselling. This review looked for randomised trials (RCTs) comparing education programmes with other strategies in patients with DKD. Only two studies involving patients with DKD were identified. Although education programmes seemed to have some beneficial effects on improvement of patients' knowledge of diabetes, self‐efficacy, belief changes and self‐management behavioural changes, the small (207) numbers of patients enrolled in the two identified studies and their low methodological quality resulted in cautious assessment. Larger, high‐quality RCTs are needed.
