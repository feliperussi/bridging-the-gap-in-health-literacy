Nedocromil sodium versus sodium cromoglycate for preventing exercise‐induced bronchoconstriction
Exercise‐induced asthma can limit people's endurance, prolong recovery time after exercise, and lead to people avoiding exercise. The episode involves symptoms such as coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath and chest tightness. Two drugs, nedocromil sodium (Tilade) and sodium cromoglycate are sometimes used before exercise to prevent asthma. The review of trials found that both were similarly effective in relieving exercise‐induced asthma for both children and adults. More people have sore throats and an unpleasant after‐taste after using nedocromil sodium.
