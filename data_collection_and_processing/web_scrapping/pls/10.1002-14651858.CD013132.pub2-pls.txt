Pharmacological treatment for continuous spike‐wave during slow wave sleep syndrome and Landau‐Kleffner syndrome 
What was studied in the review?Continuous spike‐wave during slow wave sleep syndrome (CSWS) is characterised by a regression of mental function and clinical seizures, and usually shows up in children around five years old. Landau‐Kleffner syndrome usually shows up in children aged three to eight years, who have previously developed normally. It is characterised by an inability to understand or express language, resulting in decreased communication skills. Treatment may include different drugs (pharmacological treatment), such as antiepileptic drugs and immunotherapies. 
What is the aim of this review?The aim of this Cochrane Review was to find out the benefit and adverse effects of drug treatment for CSWS and for LKS. To answer this question, we searched scientific databases for randomised controlled trials (clinical studies where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups; these are considered the gold standard for trial design). 
ResultsWe did not find any relevant, completed studies. We identified one ongoing study, which was terminated because of lack of enrolment. 
ConclusionsThere was no evidence to support or refute the use of drug treatment for continuous spike‐wave during slow wave sleep syndrome or Landau‐Kleffner syndrome. 
The evidence is current to September 2020.
