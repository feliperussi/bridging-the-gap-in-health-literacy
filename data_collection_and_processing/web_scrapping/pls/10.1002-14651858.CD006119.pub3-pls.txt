Evaluation of follow‐up strategies for patients with epithelial ovarian cancer following completion of primary treatment 
Ovarian cancer is the sixth most common cancer and seventh commonest cause of cancer death in women worldwide. Traditionally, many people who have been treated for cancer undergo long‐term follow‐up in a hospital outpatient setting. However, it has been suggested that the use of routine review (check‐ups) may not result in women with ovarian cancer living longer. We set out to review the evidence for different types of follow‐up for women who have completed treatment for the commonest type of ovarian cancer. Only one randomised study was found, and it did not find that immediate treatment with chemotherapy for relapse (identified by a tumour marker ‐ CA125 ‐ blood test) produced a benefit compared to delaying treatment until the women developed symptoms. The limited evidence suggests that there may be no benefit from early detection of recurrence of ovarian cancer and starting chemotherapy before symptoms develop. In addition, early treatment of recurrence with chemotherapy may reduce overall quality of life. 
Randomised controlled trials are needed to compare different types of follow‐up, looking at survival and quality of life outcomes. If new treatments become available for relapsed ovarian cancer, the methods of follow‐up may need to be re‐assessed to see if earlier intervention improves survival.
