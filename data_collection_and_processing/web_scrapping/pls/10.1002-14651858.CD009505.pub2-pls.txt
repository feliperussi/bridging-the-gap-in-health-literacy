Aromatase inhibitors for women with uterine fibroids
Review question 
Are aromatase Inhibitors safe and effective for treating uterine fibroids?
Background 
Uterine fibroids are the most common benign tumours in women of reproductive age. By causing heavy or irregular bleeding, subfertility or pelvic pressure symptoms, uterine fibroids have a major impact on women's health and on their quality of life. Traditional surgical treatments have a high recurrence rate and high risk of postoperative complications (e.g. pain, infertility); therefore, safer and more effective medical therapy has been sought. It has been suggested that aromatase inhibitors may shrink uterine fibroids by blocking the production of oestrogen. A review of the evidence was conducted by researchers in The Cochrane Collaboration, who searched in August 2013 for all relevant randomised controlled trials and found only one eligible study. 
Study characteristics 
Only one RCT study, consisting of 70 participants, was found. The study was conducted in teaching hospitals in Iran and Germany. It did not report on changes in fibroid‚Äêrelated symptoms or on the source of study funding. 
Key results 
The review authors concluded that, to date, evidence is insufficient to allow any conclusions to be drawn about the effectiveness and safety of AI drugs in treating women with uterine fibroids.
