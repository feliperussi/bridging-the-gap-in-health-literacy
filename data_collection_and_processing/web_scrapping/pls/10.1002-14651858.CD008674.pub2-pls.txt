Immediate versus delayed reconstruction following surgery for breast cancer
Curative treatment of breast cancer requires surgery, which can involve a mastectomy to remove the entire breast. Breast reconstruction following mastectomy can be carried out either immediately or as a delayed procedure. Immediate reconstruction is carried out at the same time as surgery while delayed reconstruction may be performed at any time following mastectomy. Several non‐randomised studies have reported differences in the psychological benefits, aesthetics and complication rates based on the timing of reconstruction. This review sought to compare the effects of the timing of reconstruction on morbidity and mortality, patient satisfaction and psychosocial well‐being. Only one eligible randomised controlled trial (RCT) was found, which involved 64 women. However, because a substantial number of participants in the study chose not to undergo delayed reconstruction, it was not possible to make a fair comparison of the mixed group with those participants who underwent immediate reconstruction. Methodological flaws and a high risk of bias also diminished the quality of evidence found in the RCT. Since we have only identified one RCT in this area, an updated version of this review will evaluate other study designs specifically good quality cohort and case‐control studies. Further research should aim to provide reliable evidence for people to make informed decisions as to the best and most appropriate timing of breast reconstruction following surgery for breast cancer.
