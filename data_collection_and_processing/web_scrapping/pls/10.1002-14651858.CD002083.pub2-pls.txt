Molindone for schizophrenia and severe mental illness
Molindone is an older antipsychotic drug with a receptor binding profile similar to that of quetiapine, a novel atypical antipsychotic. We sought to determine the effects of molindone compared with placebo, typical and atypical antipsychotics for treating schizophrenia and related psychoses. We included fourteen randomised controlled trials. When compared to other typical antipsychotics molindone shows no difference in effectiveness and is no more or less likely than typical drugs to cause movement disorders, it does however cause significantly more weight loss. At present there is no evidence to suggest that it may have an atypical profile.
