Quick versus standard vaginal birth when a baby is bottom‐down
What is the issue? 
The best outcomes in childbirth for both mothers and babies are when babies are born head‐first. If the baby is in another position, there is a higher risk of complications including the need for caesarean section. In a ‘breech presentation’ the unborn baby is bottom‐down instead of head‐down. This review looked for evidence about whether a quicker birth might be better in such cases. 
Doctors call the quicker birth ‘expedited delivery’. It means that the baby’s head appears just one contraction after its tummy has appeared. 
Why is this important? 
Quicker births might prevent babies from not getting enough oxygen. This is a risk in breech births because the cord can get squashed. If the cord is squashed, not enough blood gets to the baby. However, the methods used to make the birth quicker might harm the baby or the mother. 
What evidence did we find? 
No reliable studies were found ‐ (we searched for studies up to May 2015).
What does this mean? 
There is no evidence from reliable studies about whether speeding up the birth (‘expedited delivery’) is helpful if the baby is bottom down.
