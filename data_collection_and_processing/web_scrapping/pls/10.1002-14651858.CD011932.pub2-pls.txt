Stem cells for the prevention and treatment of bronchopulmonary dysplasia in preterm infants 
Background 
Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a chronic lung disease that often complicates the course of babies who are born too early. Bronchopulmonary dysplasia can lead to serious health issues during childhood and later in life. There is currently no effective and safe treatment for BPD. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), cells that can multiply and turn into a different type of cell, can protect the damage to newborn lungs in experimental models of BPD. Mesenchymal stem cells may bring new hope for untreatable health issues in babies born too early, including BPD, and thus improve their survival and quality of life. 
Review question 
Are MSCs, administered intravenously or endotracheally, safe and effective in preventing or treating BPD, or both, in preterm infants? 
Study characteristics 
We found no clinical trials that addressed the use of MSCs for prevention or treatment of BPD in premature infants. However, some studies are currently underway. 
Key results 
There is insufficient evidence to determine the safety and efficacy of MSCs for the treatment or prevention of BPD in premature infants. The results of the ongoing trials are expected in the near future.
