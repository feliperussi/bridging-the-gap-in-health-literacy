Recombinant growth hormone for children and adolescents with Turner syndrome
Turner syndrome (TS) is a genetic disorder affecting the sexual development and appearance of girls and women. Women with TS are much shorter than other women (by about 21 cm or eight inches). To try to overcome slow growth, recombinant growth hormone (hGH) has been given. The hormone is injected under the skin several times a week until final adult height is achieved. The review found some evidence that hGH does increase short‚Äêterm growth in girls with TS and adult height (an increase of perhaps five centimeters or two inches). However, girls treated with hGH are still substantially shorter than other women as adults. Final height in 61 treated women was 148 cm and 141 cm in 43 untreated women.
