Radioiodine treatment for pediatric Graves' disease
Graves' disease is a common cause of hyperthyroidism in children and adolescents which excessive amounts of thyroid hormones circulating in the blood. Affected children and adolescents suffer from increased heart beats, warm moist skin, fatigue, weight loss, raised body temperature, eye and other problems. Application of radioactive iodine (radioiodine), surgical removal of the thyroid gland or drugs that interfere with the production of thyroid hormones (antithyroid drugs) are used to treat this disease.  Two relevant trials with 167 patients were identified. The limited data suggest that a gland specific lower dosage of radioiodine treatment is potentially effective for pediatric GD, but a significant higher incidence of hypothyroidism compared with ATD was observed. However, all of the analysed studies were of low quality. No trial evaluated mortality, health related quality of life, economic outcomes or compliance with treatments.
