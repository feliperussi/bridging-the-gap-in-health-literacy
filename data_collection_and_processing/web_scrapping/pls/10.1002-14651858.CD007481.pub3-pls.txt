Chemicals for sticking the outer lung surface to surrounding membranes compared to surgery to stop air persistently collecting in the chest 
Cystic fibrosis is an inherited disease which irreversibly damages the lungs. People with cystic fibrosis are prone to getting a pneumothorax. A pneumothorax is defined as the presence of air in the space between the two linings of the lungs. It can potentially kill people with cystic fibrosis because of the added stress on the heart and lungs. It can be treated by surgical and non‐surgical interventions. However, although these treatments are generally effective, they are far from perfect. Certain treatments work in some people but not others. Also, the treatments do have side effects and can be dangerous for people with cystic fibrosis. Currently, physicians do not know the safest and most effective way of treating pneumothorax in people with cystic fibrosis. We did not find any randomised controlled trials that compared the surgical and non‐surgical treatments for pneumothorax in people with cystic fibrosis. Therefore, more research is needed in this field. Future studies should compare the safety and efficacy of surgical and non‐surgical interventions for pneumothorax in people with cystic fibrosis. There is currently no research being undertaken in this area. We will continue to search for evidence, but will not be updating the review until we find new evidence.
