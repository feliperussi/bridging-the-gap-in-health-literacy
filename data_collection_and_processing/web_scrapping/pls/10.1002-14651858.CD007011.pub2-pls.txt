Risperidone for ADHD in people with intellectual disabilities
Attention‐deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is more common in people with intellectual disability than in the general population.  As in the general population, ADHD adversely affects the ability to learn and is associated with behavioural disturbance, and therefore any intervention to reduce these symptoms is important. 
Risperidone is a 'newer' atypical antipsychotic medication, prescribed to people with ID for many reasons, including disruptive behaviour, ADHD and psychosis. Most of the research into using risperidone for hyperactivity or disruptive behaviour has been performed in people with autism who do not have a clear diagnosis of ADHD. The aim of this review was to examine the effectiveness of risperidone in people (children and adults) with intellectual disability and ADHD. 
No trials were found, and therefore there is no randomised controlled trial evidence to support or warn against the use of risperidone in this group of people.  It is important that this reseearch question is answered as many people with intellectual disability and ADHD are prescribed this medication.
