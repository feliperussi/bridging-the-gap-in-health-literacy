Antiretroviral regimens for patients with HIV who fail first‐line antiretroviral therapy
Highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has greatly reduced the illness and deaths of HIV‐infected people worldwide. There are many options for first‐line antiretroviral therapy (ART), but second‐line therapy is necessary for people who fail the first‐line treatment. This review attempted to assess the best ART regimen for HIV‐infected people in low‐ and middle‐income countries following treatment failure; however, the review found limited studies addressing this topic. One randomised trial and one abstract of an observational study evaluated whether or not to maintain lamivudine in second‐line regimens; both suggested no difference in outcomes. There were no studies comparing boosted PI‐containing second‐line regimens in patients failing an NNRTI‐based first‐line regimen, nor any evaluating NRTI combinations after first‐line with non‐thymidine analog combinations. While such trials are difficult to conduct for a variety of reasons, randomised controlled trails comparing second‐line therapies are needed, especially in resource‐limited settings.
