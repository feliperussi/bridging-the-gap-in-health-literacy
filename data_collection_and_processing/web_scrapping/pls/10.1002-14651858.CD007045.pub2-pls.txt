Radioactive beads given in addition to chemotherapy does not improve control of cancer nor survival in patients with colorectal cancer and metastasis in the liver. 
Bowel cancer commonly spreads to the liver. In most patients this cannot be removed by an operation and cure is not possible. Chemotherapy treatment can help control the growth of the cancer and improve survival. Radioactive beads can be injected into the blood vessels of the liver to try and control the cancer in the liver. In one study that had 21 participants, radioactive beads (injected into the blood vessels of the liver) given with chemotherapy (into the veins of the arm) was more effective at controlling the cancer and improving how long people lived than chemotherapy given on it's own. However, in this study more people who received the radioactive beads suffered from side effects and this study used an older type of chemotherapy that is less effective than the newer treatments that are now available. In a second study with 63 participants, radioactive beads were given with chemotherapy that was injected directly into the blood vessels of the liver. In this study there was no extra benefit in the control of cancer growth or survival for those participants who received radioactive beads in addition to the chemotherapy. More studies are needed with a particular focus on whether radioactive beads provides extra benefit when given with newer chemotherapy treatments, and if radioactive beads provide benefit when given on their own.
