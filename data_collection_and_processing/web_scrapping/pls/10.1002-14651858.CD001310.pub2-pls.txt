Electrical stimulation for faecal incontinence in adults
Faecal incontinence (inability to control bowel movements or leaking stool from the anus) can be a very embarrassing and socially restricting problem. There are many possible causes, including childbirth damage to the muscles which control bowel movements. Direct electrical stimulation of these muscles has been used to try to help people with faecal incontinence. The review found that there is not enough evidence from trials to judge whether electrical stimulation is helpful. Exercises and electrical stimulation used in the anus may be more helpful than vaginal exercises for women with faecal incontinence after childbirth.
