Use of alprazolam for treatment of essential tremor
Essential tremor (ET) is the most common movement disorder. Although benign in term of its effect on life expectancy, it is typically progressive and is potentially disabling. Treatment is based primarily on pharmacological agents (propranolol and primidone as first‐line therapy) that could be ineffective in 25% to 55% of patients. Alprazolam has been suggested as potentially useful in ET. The authors of this review tried to assess its efficacy and safety in people with ET. One randomized study, which compared alprazolam and placebo in 24 people with head and/or limb ET, was included. Alprazolam produced a reduction in tremor severity associated with a high frequency of adverse events. However, the small number of studies and evidence of many methodological limitations in the one included study prevent firm conclusions on the benefit‐risk profile of this treatment. Further research is needed to confirm efficacy and to assess long‐term safety of alprazolam for treatment of patients with ET.
