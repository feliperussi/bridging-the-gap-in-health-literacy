Benperidol for schizophrenia
Benperidol is a relatively old drug that is used for the treatment of schizophrenia in several European countries. We identified only one small, poorly reported, unpublished, randomised trial comparing benperidol with another antipsychotic. Unfortunately the quality of reporting is so poor that the results cannot be considered reliable. Although benperidol was first marketed in 1966, more trials on this drug are justified as with the advent of new compounds there is a danger that inexpensive drugs such as benperidol remain under‚Äêresearched and overlooked.
