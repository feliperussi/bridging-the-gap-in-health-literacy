Techniques for pelvic surgery to improve fertility
Damage to the fallopian tubes is a common cause of women having difficulty conceiving. Until assisted conception techniques such as in‚Äêvitro fertilisation (IVF) were developed the only medical treatment available to improve the chances of getting pregnant in this situation was by operating on the tubes. Such surgery has become much less common since the advent of IVF and most of the data about the results of this intervention are more than 20 years old. Women today still undergo tubal surgery if the doctor considers the prognosis is good or if IVF is not available to patients. If surgery is undertaken, various techniques have been advocated to try to enhance surgery and the pregnancy rate. These include the use of magnification including microsurgical techniques, laparoscopic surgery, laser or electrodiathermy to minimise blood loss and scarring and positioning a prosthesis around the tube. The purpose of this review is to determine the evidence to justify the use of tubal surgery, and the techniques used. 
Very few good quality studies were found that could be included in this review. There were no trials which compared the results of tubal surgery to no treatment, IVF or alternative treatment. The small studies found did not give evidence of benefit or disadvantage of any of the techniques advocated to enhance results. More studies should be undertaken to investigate the role of tubal surgery and techniques to enhance the results of surgery.
