[Transparent Cap Colonoscopy versus Standard Colonoscopy to Improve Caecal Intubation]
Fourteen randomised controlled trials were included in the review comparing Colonoscopy with the Transparent Cap with Standard Colonoscopy in the investigation of gastrointestinal tract conditions. The findings of our work suggest that there is improvement in time to caecal intubation (which indicates that the colonoscopy is complete) when using the transparent cap compared with standard colonoscopy, although this is not statistically significant. We conclude that further research is required to assess the clinical significance of this result, especially considering that there have been no adverse events noted.]
