Both hormone replacement therapy and danazol stop the loss of bone density that occurs when women take gonadotrophin‐releasing hormone analogues for endometriosis 
Endometriosis is a painful condition caused where tissue from the lining of the uterus (womb) is outside the uterus as well. It can be treated with gonadotrophin‐releasing hormone analogues (GnRHas). Possible adverse effects of GnRHas include loss of bone density, loss of sex‐drive and hot flushes. The decrease in bone density is particularly important because it increases the risk of osteoporosis. The review found that taking hormone replacement therapy with GnRHas can prevent this adverse effect. Danazol can also prevent loss of bone density, but adverse effects of danazol can include acne, weight gain and headaches.
