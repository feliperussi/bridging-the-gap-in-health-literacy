Loop diuretics for patients receiving blood transfusions
Blood transfusions are often complicated by water retention, which may worsen lung function, heart function and/or kidney function. Loop diuretics, medications that reduce body water by making the kidneys excrete more urine, are thought to prevent water retention. Accordingly, many doctors pre‐medicate their blood transfusion recipients with loop diuretics. 
The goal of our review was to determine whether pre‐medicating blood transfusion recipients with loop diuretics prevents complications of blood transfusion. Our review of four studies and 100 participants determined that there is not enough high‐quality evidence about the clinically relevant benefits or harms of using loop diuretics to prevent complications of blood transfusion.
