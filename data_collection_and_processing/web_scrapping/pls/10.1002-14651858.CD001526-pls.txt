Maximal androgen (hormone) blockade therapy may improve chances of longer survival in men with advanced prostate cancer, but may not be suitable for all men. 
The prostate gland is a common site of cancer in older men. Treatments for prostate cancer include surgery and radiation therapy. Male hormones (androgens) stimulate prostate cancer growth. Hormone suppression therapy, which decreases hormone levels, is therefore also used to try to treat the cancer. Maximal androgen blockade (MAB) uses drugs to completely block male hormones. The review found that there is modest evidence that MAB improves the chances of longer survival for men with advanced prostate cancer. However, there are also adverse effects of MAB treatment that may mean that it is not a suitable treatment for all men.
