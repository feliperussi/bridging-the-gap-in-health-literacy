Effects of using email to coordinate healthcare appointments and attendance reminders
Email is now a popular method of communication but it is not commonly used in health care. Where email has been used in health care, this has included use for coordinating healthcare appointments and attendance reminders. This review searched for high quality research studies to try to determine the effects of using email for coordinating healthcare appointments and attendance reminders, on patients, healthcare professionals and health services. This included research studies where patients could make appointments, receive reminders about their healthcare appointments and coordinate any future appointments. We did not find any studies that examined these questions and so we cannot present any results. We recommend that high‚Äêquality research is carried out to examine the use of email for this purpose.
