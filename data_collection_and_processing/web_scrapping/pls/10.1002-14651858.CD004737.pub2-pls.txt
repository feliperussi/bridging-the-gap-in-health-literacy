Placenta delivery at caesarean section
There are various methods of delivery of placenta at caesarean section. These include placental drainage with spontaneous delivery, cord traction and manual removal. The last two methods: cord traction (usually combined with massage or expression of the uterus) and manual removal are frequently used. The review identified 15 studies involving 4694 women. Delivery of the placenta by cord traction at caesarean section has more advantages compared to manual removal. These are less endometritis; less blood loss; less decrease in haematocrit levels postoperatively; and shorter duration of hospital stay.
