Surgical versus non‐surgical treatment for carpal tunnel syndrome
Carpal tunnel syndrome is caused by compression of the median nerve which goes through the carpal tunnel in the wrist. It causes tingling, numbness and pain, mostly in the hand. Treatment is controversial. This review aimed to compare surgical decompression with non‐surgical treatments such as splinting or corticosteroid injections. Four trials were found and included, while three are awaiting assessment. The results suggest that surgical treatment is probably better than splinting but it is unclear whether it is better than steroid injection. Further research is needed for those with mild symptoms.
