There is currently insufficient evidence of the effects of Huperzine A for Alzheimer's disease (AD). 
Huperzine A is derived from Chinese club moss Huperzia serrata, and is described as having several properties which may be beneficial for AD. This review looked for randomized trials comparing Huperzine A with control in patients with AD. Six trials were identified but most trials were of low methodological quality. Although Huperzine A seemed to have some beneficial effects on improvement of general cognitive function, global clinical status, behavioral disturbance and functional performance for patients with AD, the small trials with limited numbers of patients and the low methodological quality resulted in cautious assessment of the results. More large, high‚Äêquality randomized trials are needed.
