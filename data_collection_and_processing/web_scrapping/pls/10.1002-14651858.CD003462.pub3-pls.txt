Heparins reduce the number of heart attacks but caused more minor bleeding after non‐ST elevation acute coronary syndromes compared with placebo 
Blood clots in the arteries leading to the heart can cause acute coronary syndromes: unstable angina (a feeling of tightness in the chest) or a type of heart attack (non‐ST segment myocardial infarction ‐ NSTEMI). Drugs that prevent clots from forming (such as aspirin) or thin the blood (such as heparin) can relieve the problem. Unfractionated heparin (UFH) and low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) are two types of heparin. This review of trials found that UFH and LMWH when given to patients with high‐risk unstable angina or NSTEMI in the acute phase of treatment, in addition to standard therapy with aspirin, prevent more heart attacks than placebo but do not reduce mortality, the need for revascularization procedures or recurrent angina. Although there was limited reporting of side‐effects, heparins caused more cases of minor bleeding.
