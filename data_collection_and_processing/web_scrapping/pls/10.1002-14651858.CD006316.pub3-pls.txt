Pneumonia (pneumococcal) vaccines for children and adults with bronchiectasis
In many countries pneumonia vaccination (for the protection against infection of the bacteria pneumococcus), is part of the immunisation schedule for infants as well as for people with bronchiectasis. In this review, our search for randomised control trials that examined the effectiveness of pneumococcal vaccines for people with bronchiectasis revealed one randomised and one quasi‐controlled trial. We conclude that, albeit the limitations of the review, adults and children (when age appropriate) with bronchiectasis should be vaccinated with the 23‐valent polysaccharide pneumococcal vaccine as suggested in many national guidelines. Due to absence of data on how often the vaccine should be given, we recommend that national guidelines be followed until further evidence is available.
