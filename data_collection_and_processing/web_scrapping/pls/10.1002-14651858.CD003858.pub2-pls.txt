Information to encourage pregnant women to attempt vaginal birth has not been shown to change caesarean birth rates 
Caesarean births have become more common in many countries. Women need information to know what to expect after surgery and to help them make decisions. Women's choices are thought to contribute to the rise in caesarean births. Information given to pregnant women may affect their choices. Shortcomings in the included studies mean the evidence is inconclusive, although the trials found that information to encourage women to attempt vaginal birth did not affect caesarean birth rates. More research is urgently needed.
