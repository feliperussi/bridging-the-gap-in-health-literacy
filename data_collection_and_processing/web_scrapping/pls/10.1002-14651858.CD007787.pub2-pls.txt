Drugs for treating giardiasis
Giardiasis is an infection of the small intestine caused by a microscopic organism called Giardia lamblia. The infection is passed from person to person by ingesting faecally contaminated water or food. Symptoms frequently include diarrhoea, abdominal pain, flatulence, bloating, vomiting, and weight loss. In this review, we assess alternatives to the most commonly used treatment for giardiasis; metronidazole given orally for five or more days. 
We identified 19 trials involving 1817 participants, of which 1441 were children. Most trials had a small number of participants and were at high risk of bias. Albendazole is probably of similar effectiveness to metronidazole, probably has fewer side effects, and has the advantage of a simplified regimen. Large, high quality trials, assessing clinical outcomes are required to assess further alternatives.
