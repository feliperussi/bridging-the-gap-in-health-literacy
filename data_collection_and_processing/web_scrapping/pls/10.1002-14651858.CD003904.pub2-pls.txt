Exercise for treating people with diseases of their peripheral nerves (peripheral neuropathy) 
Peripheral neuropathies are a wide range of diseases (both genetic and acquired) affecting the peripheral nerves. Symptoms can include pain, altered sensation such as tingling or numbness, muscle weakness and fatigue. Exercise therapy, with a view to improving strength and stamina, forms part of many rehabilitation programmes after a peripheral neuropathy. This review found inadequate evidence from randomised controlled trials to evaluate the effect of exercise in disability in peripheral neuropathy. There was evidence that strengthening exercises moderately improve muscle strength in people with a peripheral neuropathy.
