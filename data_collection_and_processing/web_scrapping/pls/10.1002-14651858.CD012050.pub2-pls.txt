Statin withdrawal in people with dementia
Dementia (including Alzheimer's disease) is a global healthcare concern; there are approximately 24 million people worldwide with dementia, and this is likely to increase to 81 million by 2040. Dementia is a slowly progressing condition, and persons affected may experience a gradual decline over eight to ten years. Medications that are appropriately prescribed when someone has mild dementia may no longer be appropriate as dementia progresses to severe. Statins are prescribed to lower cholesterol levels in the blood; in most cases, they help prevent myocardial infarctions (heart attacks) or strokes, but the benefits are only seen after using them for a period of months or years. They have well known side‚Äêeffects, such as muscle pain, and it is not known if the benefits of these medications outweigh the risks in persons with advanced dementia. 
Study characteristics 
We searched several medical databases on 11 February 2016 to look for clinical trials that compared continuing a statin to withdrawing a statin, in persons with dementia. 
Key findings 
We found no studies that were suitable for our review. This highlights the need for further high quality research into this area.
