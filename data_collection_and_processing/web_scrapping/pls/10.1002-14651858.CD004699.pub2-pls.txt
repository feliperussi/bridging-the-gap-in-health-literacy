Surgery may improve survival rates for non‚Äêsmall cell lung cancer limited to the lung and surrounding affected glands 
Surgical resection is currently considered to be the best treatment for some types of lung cancer limited to the lung and surrounding glands with tumour cells (lymph nodes). There is no compelling evidence to show that lung cancer surgery improves survival compared with other types of therapy such as radiotherapy or chemotherapy. Surgery is often performed in combination with removal of lymph nodes draining the lung with the tumour. There is some evidence that complete removal of all lymph nodes may improve survival compared with only removing a limited number of nodes. Individuals with small cancers localised to the lung appear to have an increased risk of local recurrence if treated with a limited resection rather than a more extensive resection of the involved lung. More research is needed to better understand the types of patients that might benefit most from surgery.
