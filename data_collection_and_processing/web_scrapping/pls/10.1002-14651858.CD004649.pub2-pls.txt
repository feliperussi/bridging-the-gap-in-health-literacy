Laxatives for the treatment of hemorrhoids
Symptomatic hemorrhoids are a common medical condition but what causes them is not completely understood. Minimizing constipation with its associated prolonged straining may affect both lifestyle measures and medicines used as treatments for symptomatic hemorrhoids.  This systematic review suggests a beneficial effect of laxatives in the form of fiber for improving symptoms of hemorrhoids, especially bleeding. The improvement, halving the risk of having overall symptoms, was consistent over up to three months follow up. The results for other symptoms such as prolapse, pain or itching were not clear from the included trials.  The relatively small number of patients enrolled in trials to date could argue for the need for additional larger trials.
