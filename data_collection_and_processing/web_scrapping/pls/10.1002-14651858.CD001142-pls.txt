Interventions for treating constipation in pregnancy
Mild laxatives help relieve constipation in pregnancy.
Constipation is a common problem in late pregnancy. The time taken for food to get through the gut to the bowel is increased in the second and third trimester and may be caused by an increase in the hormone, progesterone. Adding more fibre to the diet increases the frequency of defecation (bowel movement) and leads to softer stools. The review of trials found that laxatives which stimulate the bowel are more effective than those that add bulk but may cause more adverse effects such as diarrhoea and abdominal pain. Fibre supplements are effective and appear to have no adverse effects.
