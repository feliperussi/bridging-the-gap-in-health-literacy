Treatment with cyclosporine raises blood pressure
Cyclosporine is an immunosuppressive agent discovered in 1972. It was first used to prevent rejection after organ transplantation and more recently, for management of autoimmune diseases. Common side effects associated with cyclosporine therapy are nephrotoxicity and hypertension. To observe the magnitude of elevated blood pressure caused by cyclosporine compared to placebo, we searched the available scientific literature. We identified 17 trials that met our inclusion criteria and had extractable data. 
This systematic review found an important increase in blood pressure for patients treated with cyclosporine with a best estimate of the overall magnitude of 7 mmHg. A dose‚Äêrelated effect was also observed, with an average increase in mean blood pressure ranging from 5 mmHg with low doses to 11 mmHg with high doses of cyclosporine. This increase is of clinical importance and suggests that prescribers should try to find the lowest effective dose in all patients on chronic therapy.
