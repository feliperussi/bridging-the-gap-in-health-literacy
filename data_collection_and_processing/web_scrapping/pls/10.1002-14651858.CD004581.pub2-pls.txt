Closed tracheal suction systems versus open tracheal systems for mechanically ventilated adults 
The comparison of open and closed suction systems shows them to have similar results in terms of safety and effectiveness. 
Tracheal secretions in mechanically ventilated patients are removed using a catheter via the endotracheal tube. The suction catheter can be introduced by disconnecting the patient from the ventilator (open suction system) or by introducing the catheter into the ventilatory circuit (closed suction system). Although the literature reports several advantages for the closed suction system, the review did not show differences between the two systems in the main outcomes studied. These outcomes were ventilator‐associated pneumonia and mortality. This review identified few trials of high methodological quality. Future research should be of higher quality, clarify issues related to the patient's condition and to technique, and provide nurse‐related outcomes.
