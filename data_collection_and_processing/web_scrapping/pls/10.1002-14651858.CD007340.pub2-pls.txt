Bariatric surgery for non‐alcoholic steatohepatitis in obese patients
Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the liver manifestation of metabolic syndrome in which obesity and resistance to the insulin action are the hallmark. Fat accumulation in the liver produces inflammation and chronic liver damage, known as non‐alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Nowadays, the best strategy to treat NAFLD and NASH is weight loss. Surgical procedures to treat obesity (bariatric surgery) have shown good results to reduce fat accumulation and even improve other obesity‐related conditions. However, neither the benefits nor the harms of bariatric surgery in NASH have been assessed in any systematic review or meta‐analysis of randomised clinical trials. The present Cochrane review attempted to evaluate the benefits and risks of bariatric surgery for NASH in obese patients, but as no randomised clinical trials fulfilling the inclusion criteria of the review protocol were found, the review was not able to address the pre‐specified in the protocol aims. Prospective and retrospective cohort studies reported on beneficial effects on steatosis and inflammation, with potential increase of liver fibrosis, but the studies were too heterogenous and with a small number of patients. Hence, the data, which the latter studies contained, are with a high risk of bias, and a reliable summary of their data cannot be achieved. Due to the absence of trials, well‐designed randomised trials to assess bariatric surgery as a safe and effective treatment of NASH are required.
