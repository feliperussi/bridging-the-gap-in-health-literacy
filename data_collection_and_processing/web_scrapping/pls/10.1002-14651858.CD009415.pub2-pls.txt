Zinc supplements for thalassaemia and sickle cell disease
Zinc is an essential micronutrient, which is needed so that the immune system works at its best and helps the body fight off infection. People may not get enough zinc from food alone. Researchers have therefore looked at zinc supplements as a way of reducing anaemia and preventing infections and complications. The review authors searched the medical literature for randomised controlled studies in which people with sickle cell disease or thalassaemia received either zinc supplements or no supplements. We included nine trials in the review (459 participants). In people with thalassaemia, there is no evidence to indicate any benefit of zinc supplements on serum zinc level. However, there was an improvement in height in those who received the supplements. There is mixed evidence on the benefit of using zinc supplements in people with sickle cell disease. For instance, there is evidence that when supplements are given for one year the serum zinc levels increased; however, haemoglobin levels and body mass index did not differ significantly between groups. We also found that people with sickle cell disease who received zinc supplements (at both three months and at one year) had fewer sickle cell crises and infections. However, given that the total number of trials is small, these results should be treated with caution.
