The effects of singing for children and adults with bronchiectasis
People with bronchiectasis (a chronic lung condition) have chest symptoms that include chronic wet cough, fatigue and shortness of breath. Their lung function can also decline with time. Singing may support lung function and enhance quality of life in people with bronchiectasis. The review found no randomised controlled trials that evaluated the benefits of singing in bronchiectasis. As there is no data, we cannot conclude whether or not singing is a beneficial intervention for people with bronchiectasis.
