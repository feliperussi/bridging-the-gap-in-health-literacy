Surgical and non‚Äêsurgical methods of cleaning and removing dead tissue from sores on the feet of people with diabetes. 
People with diabetes often develop foot ulcers (open sores on the feet that go through the skin), which are a serious complication and can themselves result in serious consequences such as amputation. Cleaning and removing dead tissue and callus from the ulcers is a common procedure also know as "debridement" and can be done in several ways, including surgery and special dressings and gels (such as hydrogels). The review found that hydrogel results in faster healing than gauze or standard care. The evidence for other debriding strategies is unclear.
