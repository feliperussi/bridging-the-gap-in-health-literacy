Gangliosides for acute ischaemic stroke
There is no evidence that treatment with ganglioside reduces disability after stroke. Drugs which can reduce disability in people who survive an acute stroke are needed. Gangliosides are a component of cells membranes and can protect neurons against injuries and enhance their growth. Ganglioside treatment has been tested in many clinical trials, mostly on patients with stroke. The results of these studies were inconclusive. This review shows that there is no evidence in favour of this treatment for patients with acute stroke. Gangliosides can rarely cause damage to nerves (acute neuropathy).
