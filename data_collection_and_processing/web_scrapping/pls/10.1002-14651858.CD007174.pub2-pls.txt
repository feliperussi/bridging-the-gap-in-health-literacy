Immunonutrition as an adjuvant therapy for burns
With burn injuries involving a large total body surface area, damage and breakdown of tissues can result in a condition similar to that seen with severe malnourishment. In addition, destruction of the effective skin barrier leads to body temperature dysregulation and increased susceptibility to infection and fluid loss. Previous studies have investigated specific naturally occurring additives to nutritional support, which may lead to an increase in immune system function and therefore a reduction in infection, hospital length of stay and chance of death. These additives are termed immunonutrients and include glutamine, arginine, branched‐chain amino acids (BCAAs) and omega‐3 fatty acids (fish oil). The authors of this review searched for randomised controlled trials assessing the effects of immunonutrients in patients with severe burn injury. 
Results of this review show that only glutamine could potentially reduce risk of death. However, the total number of patients within the combined studies is too small; therefore conclusions may be imprecise. More studies are needed to determine the efficacy of immunonutrition.
