Electrical stimulation for preventing and treating post‚Äêstroke shoulder pain
Electrical stimulation of muscles improves shoulder stiffness after a stroke but there is not enough evidence to prove whether it reduces shoulder pain. Patients who have a stroke (a sudden catastrophe in the brain either because an artery to the brain blocks, or because an artery in or on the brain ruptures and bleeds) often develop shoulder pain. This adds to the difficulties caused by the stroke. Pain in the shoulder can cause weakness, loss of muscle tone and loss of feeling. Electrical neuromuscular stimulation (ES) is done by applying an electrical current to the skin. This stimulates nerves and muscle fibres and may improve muscle tone, muscle strength, and reduce pain. The review found that shoulder stiffness improved after ES. No adverse effects were noted. The review also found there was not enough evidence to decide if ES can reduce shoulder pain or not. More research is needed.
