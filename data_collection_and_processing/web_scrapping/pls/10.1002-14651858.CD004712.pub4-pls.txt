Using oxygen at high pressure (in a compression chamber) for the treatment of broken bones 
Broken bones (fractures) are very common and sometimes may take a long time to heal or in some cases may fail to heal. The resulting non‐union can result in long‐term pain and loss of function. The use of hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) has been suggested as a way to enhance healing and treat non‐union. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy involves the delivery of oxygen at high pressure to patients in a specially designed chamber (like those used for deep sea divers suffering pressure problems after resurfacing). The aim is to increase the supply of oxygen to the fracture site, which theoretically should improve healing. It should be noted that hyperbaric oxygen therapy may, albeit rarely, result in serious long‐term adverse effects. 
This review found no evidence from randomised trials to support or refute the use of hyperbaric oxygen therapy to avoid or treat poorly healing broken bones. However, in this update, we found three ongoing randomised trials that are likely to provide some evidence to inform on the use of hyperbaric oxygen therapy in the future.
