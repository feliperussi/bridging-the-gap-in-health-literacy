No clear evidence that Cisapride relieves symptoms related to constipation or irritable bowel disease. 
Cisapride has been used as a prokinetic to treat constipation, but was found to have some serious side effects and was directly associated with fatalities from those side effects. Though it has been removed from the market and has not been used in most of the world's health institutes, it can still be prescribed in certain situations and is easily purchased through dealers on the Internet. We conducted a systematic review to assess whether or not cisapride actually relieves constipation and controls the symptoms of irritable bowel disease, in addition to looking at whether or not these effects are worth its use compared to the risk of cisapride's dangerous side effects. Through a detailed look at the literature, we found no clear evidence to suggest that cisapride has a role in controlling symptoms related to constipation or IBS and believe its not worth the risk of its possibly fatal arrhythmia side effects.
