Interventions for the treatment of fractures of the mandibular condyle
Fractures of the condylar process of the mandible (lower jaw) are common. Two treatment options are available: either closed treatment (without surgery) or open reduction (involving surgery). Complications are associated with both treatment modalities. With a closed approach the complications include disturbances in the way the teeth meet, facial asymmetry, chronic pain and reduced mobility of the lower jaw. With an open approach the complications include a scar on the overlying skin and also the possibility of temporary paralysis of the nerve supplying some of the facial muscles involved in smiling and eye opening/closing. Currently there is much controversy regarding the most appropriate method for the management of fractured mandibular condyles. This review revealed that there is a lack of high quality evidence for the effectiveness of either approach, and that there is a need for further research to help clinicians and patients to make informed choices of treatment options.
