No evidence that insertion of drains after plastic and reconstructive surgery of the breast reduces complications 
Plastic and reconstructive surgery of the breast can include breast enlargement, breast reduction, and breast reconstruction (e.g. after breast removal in breast cancer patients). Such operations are routinely performed in most hospitals. The typical duration of hospital stay is about 3 days. These operations carry a risk of complications such as wound infection, fluid accumulation, death of parts of the breast tissue, and wound healing problems, These are often minor and do not affect the end result, but can result in a longer stay in hospital and extra medical treatment. For several decades surgeons have been inserting wound drains after these procedures expecting to minimize possible complications, although it is unclear whether there is any evidence to support this. We reviewed the limited evidence available from clinical trials, and found no evidence that the use of drains improves patient outcomes in breast reduction surgery. On the contrary, the use of drains seemed to be associated with a slightly longer stay in hospital of about one day. There were no trials in people undergoing breast augmentation or reconstruction.
