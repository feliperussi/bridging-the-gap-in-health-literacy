Early birth for babies with gastroschisis
Gastroschisis is where the bowel protrudes through a hole caused by a weakness in the abdominal wall and affects about one in 5000 babies. It can be detected on prenatal ultrasound scans. The defect is usually repaired surgically within a few hours of birth, and most babies eventually do well. Many, however, require prolonged intensive care support and artifical feeding, and some babies die. Some have long‐term bowel problems with malabsorption. Before the baby is born, the exposed bowel can be injured, and early birth may prevent this. However, early birth may also cause complications due to prematurity for the baby and possibly longer labour for the mother. There is currently no clear guidance. This review identified one small randomised controlled trials, involving 42 women. There were no significant differences in outcomes for mother or baby when pre‐term birth at 36 weeks was planned, compared with later birth. However, it was such a small trial that it does not rule out important benefits or harms from early birth. There was also small overall difference in gestational age at birth between the two groups in the trial, possibly because of the high rate of spontaneous preterm birth with this condition. Further trials are needed.
