Vitamin E for intermittent claudication
Intermittent claudication is a cramping pain, brought on by exercise and relieved by rest, that is caused by an inadequate blood flow to the calf and leg muscles. It is a symptom of atherosclerosis, a disease where fatty deposits build up in the arteries, blocking blood flow. It has been suggested that taking Vitamin E may improve blood flow and boost the body's ability to repair. The review of trials found that more research is needed to show if Vitamin E reduces the effect of intermittent claudication. No adverse effects were found.
