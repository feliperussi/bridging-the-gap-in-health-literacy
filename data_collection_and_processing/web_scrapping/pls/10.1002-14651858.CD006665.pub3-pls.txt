Vitamin C for preventing and treating tetanus
Tetanus is a disease caused by tetanus toxin, which is produced by the bacterium Clostridium tetani. This bacterium typically infects penetrating wounds contaminated by foreign material such as soil. In developing countries, poor hygiene after childbirth may cause tetanus in newborn babies. Even though vaccination has dramatically decreased the burden of tetanus, there are still about 1 million tetanus cases per year globally. We found one controlled trial that examined whether one gram per day of intravenous vitamin C would help in the treatment of tetanus patients. Vitamin C was used alongside standard treatments for tetanus. Intravenous vitamin C reduced the mortality of children aged between 1 and 12 with tetanus by 100% and that of 13 to 30 year old patients by 45%. The trial was not properly conducted and caution is required in the interpretation of the findings. Vitamin C cannot be recommended as a treatment for tetanus on the basis of this single study. Further investigation of the role of vitamin C in tetanus treatment is warranted.
