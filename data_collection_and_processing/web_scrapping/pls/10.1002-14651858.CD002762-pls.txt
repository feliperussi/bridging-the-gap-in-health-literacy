Piroxicam as a single dose in treating acute postoperative pain
There is insufficient evidence that single doses of piroxicam provide effective analgesia in adults with acute postoperative pain. This review assessed the efficacy of oral single‐dose piroxicam in adults with moderate/severe postoperative pain using information from randomised placebo controlled trials. The results were based on few data and were not robust. The results suggested that piroxicam (20 mg or 40 mg) was more effective than placebo and comparable to other non‐steroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs and intramuscular morphine 10 mg. Adverse effects were uncommon. The most frequently reported adverse effects were dizziness, nausea and vomiting.
