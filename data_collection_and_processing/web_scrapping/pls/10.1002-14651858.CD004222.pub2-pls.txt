Treatment for women with postpartum iron deficiency anaemia
Erythropoietin, a hormone, may help to treat women who develop anaemia after giving birth, but there may be rare adverse events. 
Women with anaemia after childbirth may feel tired and breathless and are at risk of infection. Traditional treatments include iron supplementation and blood transfusion for severe anaemia. A hormone, erythropoietin, may help improve iron levels in the blood and the woman's ability to lactate. However, rare adverse events (damage to red blood cells) have been reported. No studies examined the effects of oral iron supplementation alone, the most common treatment for this type of anaemia, or blood transfusions as treatments for women with anaemia after childbirth. More research, particularly of simple interventions such as oral iron supplementation, is required.
