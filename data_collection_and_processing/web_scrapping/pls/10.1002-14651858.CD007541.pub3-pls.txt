Progestin‐only pills for contraception
Progestin‐only pills, as their name implies, contain just one hormone. The more common birth control pills combine two hormones. How these one‐hormone pills compare to each other or to two‐hormone pills is not clear. Hence, we did this review to compare progestin‐only pills to other similar pills or to combined (two‐hormone) pills. Through October 2013, we did a computer search and literature search to find randomized trials of progestin‐only pills. 
We found six trials for the initial review. We have not found any more studies since then. Some studies are several decades old and not very relevant to pills available today. A newer pill containing the progestin desogestrel may work better to prevent pregnancy than an older pill with levonorgestrel. The newer pill caused more bleeding problems. Pills with levonorgestrel may be more effective than pills with other progestins that are no longer used. 
These studies are not adequate to tell how progestin‐only pills compare to each other or to combined (two‐hormone) pills. Larger studies with currently used pills are needed to answer these questions.
