Supportive devices for preventing and treating subluxation of the shoulder after stroke
There is insufficient evidence to conclude that supportive devices are effective in the prevention and treatment of subluxation of the shoulder after stroke. Shoulder subluxation is one of the most common secondary musculoskeletal problems after stroke which can cause pain and hinder the recovery of upper limb function. Supportive devices have traditionally been applied to treat shoulder subluxation. This review of four trials found insufficient evidence to conclude whether supportive devices prevent subluxation or not and found no evidence to conclude whether supportive devices can reposition the head of humerus in the glenoid fossa of an already subluxed shoulder.
