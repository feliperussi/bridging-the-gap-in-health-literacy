Whole‚Äêbody vibration platform training in patients with neurodegenerative diseases
Rehabilitation is considered to be a key symptomatic and supportive treatment for neurodegenerative diseases. Exercise training using vibratory platform (whole body vibration) has been recently introduced as a complementary treatment to rehabilitation.This review identified ten trials performing whole body vibration (WBV) in neurodegenerative diseases: six in Parkinson's disease and four in multiple sclerosis. Diversity in treatments and outcomes measures makes difficult to quantitatively compare the effect of WBV intervention across studies and to assess its efficacy. There is insufficient evidence to determine the potential benefits of WBV training in functional performance according to activities of daily life, body balance, signs and symptoms of disease, muscle performance, and quality of life in patients with neurodegenerative diseases. Adverse events were poorly reported in the included studies, but this kind of training seems to be a safe intervention. These conclusions are based on a small number of studies with a limited methodological quality.
