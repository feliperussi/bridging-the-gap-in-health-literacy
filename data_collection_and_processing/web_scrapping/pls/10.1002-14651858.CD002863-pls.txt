Oral beta‐blockers for mild to moderate hypertension during pregnancy
Pregnant women with mild to moderate hypertension taking beta‐blockers have reduced blood pressure, but these drugs may have adverse effects on the baby. 
While very high blood pressure (hypertension) in pregnancy can damage blood vessel walls and lead to serious complications, small rises in blood pressure may do little harm. The blood pressure level at which treatment should be started in pregnancy is not known. Beta‐blocker drugs cause the heart to beat more slowly and less forcefully, reducing pressure on blood vessels. This review of trials found that pregnant women with mild to moderate hypertension who take beta‐blockers have lower blood pressure, but the baby may grow more slowly than expected. There is not enough evidence on other effects. Further research is needed.
