This review did not find strong evidence to demonstrate the effect of traditional Chinese herbal products in the treatment of stable angina 
Traditional Chinese herbal products (TCHP) are often used to treat patients with stable angina but there is not sufficient evidence to show that TCHP are effective. The authors of this review undertook a systematic review of the potential benefits and safety of TCHP in patients with stable angina. Three randomised controlled studies with a total of 216 patients were identified. Only one small trial was able to detect benefits of using TCHP compared with nitrates in improving angina symptoms. The remaining two trials were inconclusive. Due to the very small number of included studies and participants in the studies, TCHP should be used with caution. We recommend that larger‚Äêscale high quality randomised controlled trials of TCHP are required to strengthen the evidence for the efficacy and safety of certain TCHP in treating angina.
