Intensity of stationary cycling, treadmill or ground walking as a mild form of exercise for people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) 
Supervised lower limb endurance training programmes for people with COPD involve stationary cycling or treadmill or ground walking. The intensity of training is considered a key component to improve exercise capacity. As we wanted to explore whether more or less intense training is better for improving exercise capacity, symptoms and quality of life, we examined trials with higher or lower levels of training intensity in people with COPD. 
Exercise training can be prescribed as interval or continuous. Interval training is brief periods (one to three minutes) of exercise at high intensity alternated with short periods of recovery whereas continuous training is completing the endurance training without a break. We compared interval training with continuous training to determine whether one type of training was superior to the other in gaining improvements in exercise capacity, symptoms and quality of life. 
Conclusions 
We found three studies comparing higher with lower‐intensity training. Due to a small number of studies and participants, data are limited in evaluating the effects of different levels of training intensity on exercise capacity, breathlessness and quality of life. We also found eight studies that compared continuous with interval training. There was no significant difference between continuous and interval training in improvements in exercise capacity, breathlessness and quality of life.
