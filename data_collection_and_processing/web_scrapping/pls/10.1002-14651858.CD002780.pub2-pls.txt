One topical fluoride (toothpastes, or mouthrinses, or gels, or varnishes) versus another for preventing dental caries in children and adolescents 
Topical fluorides such as mouthrinses and gels do not appear to be more effective at reducing tooth decay in children and adolescents than fluoride toothpaste.  Tooth decay (dental caries) is painful, expensive to treat and can seriously damage teeth. Fluoride is a mineral that prevents tooth decay. Fluoride is added to the water supply in many areas. It can also be applied in the form of toothpastes, mouthrinses, gels or varnishes. The review of trials found that fluoride toothpastes, mouthrinses and gels reduce tooth decay in children and adolescents to a similar extent. However, toothpastes are more likely to be regularly used. There is no strong evidence that varnishes are more effective than other types of topical fluoride.
