Hemodialysis for lithium poisoning
Background 
Lithium salts, particularly lithium carbonate, are frequently used to treat bipolar disorder and mania. Lithium poisoning, whether due to reduced excretion by the kidneys or overdose, can cause permanent injury to the nervous system. Hemodialysis is a process in which a person's blood is filtered outside of their body, by a machine, and then returned to the person's body. Hemodialysis effectively removes lithium from the body, and has been used to treat lithium poisoning for at least 40 years. However, it is not known whether hemodialysis, performed in addition to standard therapy with intravenous fluids, reduces or eliminates damage to the nervous system.

Study characteristics 
This review found no randomized controlled trials assessing the use of hemodialysis to treat lithium poisoning. 
Key results 
Although the use of hemodialysis to remove lithium from patients with lithium poisoning is logical, no randomized clinical trials support or disprove a benefit from this therapy.
