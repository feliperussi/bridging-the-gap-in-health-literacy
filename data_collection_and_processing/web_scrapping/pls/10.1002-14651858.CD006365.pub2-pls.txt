Problem solving skills for schizophrenia
People with schizophrenia often have lack the ability to solve problems arising from day to day living and stressful life events. These deficits can affect their ability to live independently, and contribute to disability and poor quality of life. Problem solving therapy is a psychological intervention designed to improve the ability of people with schizophrenia to approach problems in a systematic way and this therapy can be used in addition to antipsychotic medication and other supportive interventions. 
Problem solving therapy involves several key stages: (i) linking symptoms to problems, (ii) defining the problems, (iii) setting achievable goals, (iv) generating and choosing preferred solutions, (v) implementing preferred solutions and (vi) evaluating the result of the solution. If dealing more effectively with the problems of daily life were to reduce stress, it is possible that the risk of a relapse or increase in symptoms could be lowered. 
We evaluated the effectiveness of problem solving therapy compared with other comparable therapies or routine care for those with schizophrenia. We included three small randomised trials. The overall results were inconclusive and did not demonstrate a significant advantage for problem solving in affecting hospital admission, mental state, behaviour or social skills. We are currently unable, from the results of this review, to provide guidance to support or discourage the use of problem solving skills training as an additional treatment for people with schizophrenia.
