Training, experience and volumes on outcomes for persons living with HIV/AIDS: A systematic review 
The training and qualifications of providers treating patients with HIV/AIDS is very important. But equally important is an understanding of the impact of numbers of patients treated by providers on key medical outcomes (e.g. viral load measures, mortality, the receipt of anti‐retroviral medications, opportunistic infection (OI) prophylaxis as well as economic outcomes such as health care utilization or patient costs) in the care of persons living with HIV/AIDS. This systematic review examined studies from 1980‐2009 that identified both provider experience/qualifications as well as a volumes indicator (number of HIV/AIDS patients). Only four studies met the inclusion criteria for the final review. Given the varied methods of each study, a meta‐analysis was not possible.
