No evidence of the efficacy and safety of D‐cycloserine in the treatment of patients with Alzheimer's disease 
D‐cycloserine is a broad‐spectrum antibiotic formerly used at high doses (500‐1000 mg/day) for the treatment of tuberculosis (TB). It has been suggested that D‐cycloserine might improve memory and other cognitive processes through its desired effects on N‐methyl‐D‐aspartate (NMDA) receptor function. It was not possible to extract the results from the first phases of two included crossover studies of D‐cycloserine for Alzheimer's disease and therefore the meta‐analyses are based on the included two parallel group 6‐month studies. The lack of a positive effect of D‐cycloserine on cognitive outcomes in controlled clinical trials with statistical power high enough to detect a clinically meaningful effect means that D‐cycloserine has no place in the treatment of patients with Alzheimer's disease.
