Use of pregabalin for the treatment of essential tremor
Review question 
The authors of this review tried to assess the effectiveness and safety of pregabalin in people with essential tremor. 
Backgound 
Essential tremor is the most common movement disorder. Although benign in terms of its effect on life expectancy, it is typically progressive and potentially disabling. Treatment consists primarily of pharmacological agents (propranolol and primidone as first‐line therapy), which could be ineffective for 25% to 55% of patients. Some specialists have suggested that pregabalin could be a potentially useful drug for treating the condition. 
Study characteristics 
We found one study comparing pregabalin versus placebo, involving 22 randomised participants with essential tremor. 
Key results 
The impact of pregabalin on functional abilities and adverse effects is uncertain because the quality of the evidence is very low. 
Quality of the evidence 
The lack of studies and the significant limitations in the one included trial preclude firm conclusions about the risk‐benefit profile of this treatment.
