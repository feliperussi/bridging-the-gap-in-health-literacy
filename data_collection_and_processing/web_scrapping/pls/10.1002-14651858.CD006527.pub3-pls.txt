Educational interventions for preventing eye injuries
Eye injuries are a preventable cause of blindness, yet remain a significant disabling health problem that affects all age groups. Despite health and safety requirements and widespread legislation, injuries can still occur at home, in the workplace, during recreational activities or as a result of road crashes. 
The authors of this review searched for randomised controlled trials and controlled before‐and‐after studies looking at the effectiveness of educational interventions, such as written materials, video or audio tapes, for the prevention of eye injuries. The authors found five studies involving different types of people, using various educational interventions and based in different countries, that met the inclusion criteria. Due to the low quality of the studies identified, the authors concluded that there is no reliable evidence that educational interventions are effective in preventing eye injuries. 
The review authors recommend that further high quality randomised controlled trials, with longer follow‐up periods are conducted. More trials should be based in low and middle‐income countries in order to carry out a comparison with those in high‐income countries.
