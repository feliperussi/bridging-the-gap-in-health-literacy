Soy formula for prevention of allergy and food intolerance in infants
When babies are not exclusively breastfed, evidence suggests that using a soy formula instead of a cow's milk formula does not reduce allergies in infants and children. Infant formulas have been designed to try to lower the chances of developing allergy or food intolerance. These formulas include hydrolysed cow's milk and soy formulas. A review of trials found that in infants at high risk of allergy who are unable to completely breastfeed, there is no reduction in allergies in later infancy and childhood associated with feeding soy formula compared to a cow's milk formula. No eligible studies were found that compared a soy with a hydrolysed protein formula.
