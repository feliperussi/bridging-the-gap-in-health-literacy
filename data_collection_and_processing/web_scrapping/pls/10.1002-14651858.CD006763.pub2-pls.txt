Does altering dietary salt intake aid in the prevention and treatment of diabetic kidney disease? 
There is strong evidence that our current consumption of salt is a major factor in increasing blood pressure (BP), whether BP levels are normal or raised. Diabetes makes it more likely to develop high BP, which increases the risk of strokes, heart attacks and speeds up the progression of diabetic kidney disease. This review found 13 studies including 254 patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Reducing salt intake by 8.5 g/day lowered BP by 7/3 mm Hg. Public health guidelines recommend reducing dietary salt intake to less than 5‐6 g/day and people with diabetes would benefit from reducing salt in their diet to at least this level.
