There is not enough evidence about the safety and effectiveness of amantadine for people with dyskinesia in Parkinson's disease. 
Levodopa is regarded as the most effective treatment for Parkinson's disease but in many patients it causes abnormal involuntary movements known as dyskinesias. It is thought that amantadine may be added to levodopa to reduce dyskinesias in patients with Parkinson's disease without worsening Parkinsonian symptoms. This review found that there is not enough evidence from trials about the effects of amantadine for people with dyskinesia in Parkinson's disease. Adverse effects in trials so far have included confusion, worsening of hallucinations, the re‚Äêemergence of palpitations, nausea, dry mouth, swelling of feet and constipation.
