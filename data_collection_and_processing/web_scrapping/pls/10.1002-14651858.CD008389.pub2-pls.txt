Interventions for eye movement disorders in people with stroke
Eye movement disorders may affect over 70% of stroke patients and can make it difficult to keep both eyes in their normal position when looking straight ahead, or can make it difficult to move the eyes accurately to look in a different direction. This can affect patients' perception of depth, makes it difficult for them to take in their whole surroundings and can severely affect the ability to read. We found only two randomised controlled trials which investigated treatments for eye movement disorders. Both of these studies investigated the effect of drug treatments. A total of 28 participants were included but only five of these were people with stroke. One study found that the people with stroke responded differently to the drug treatment than people who had eye movement disorders due to other conditions. These studies provide too little evidence from which to reach any conclusions about the effectiveness of interventions for patients with eye movement disorders after stroke. Further research is urgently required.
