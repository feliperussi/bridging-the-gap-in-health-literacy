External counterpulsation for acute ischaemic stroke
Some studies have indicated that poor cerebral perfusion is related to unfavourable functional outcomes, precipitating strokes and other vascular events, which are often responsible for high mortality rates. External counterpulsation (ECP) is a non‐invasive and acceptable method which is known to improve perfusion of the brain. It provides pressure to the calves, thighs and buttocks by means of air‐filled cuffs. This helps to increase blood flow to the heart, brain and kidneys. This review identified two randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of ECP involving 160 participants with acute ischaemic stroke. There is no convincing evidence to support the routine use of ECP for the treatment of patients with acute ischaemic stroke. Further high‐quality and large‐scale RCTs are needed.
