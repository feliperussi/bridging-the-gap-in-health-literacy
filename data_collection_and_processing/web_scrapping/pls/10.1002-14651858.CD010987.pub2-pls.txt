Magnifying reading aids for children and teenagers with low vision
Background  Low vision in children and teenagers not only affects reading, learning and education but is also thought to have a significant effect on a child's general development. Magnifying reading aids can assist a child or teenager to make the best use of the vision they have. 
We reviewed the current evidence on the use of magnifying reading aids in children between the ages of 5 and 16 years of age with low vision, when compared to the use of glasses alone. We included magnifying aids such as hand‐ or stand‐held magnifying glasses, telescopes or binoculars but we excluded electronic reading aids which will be the subject of a separate review. 
Search date  The electronic databases were last searched on 8 January 2015. 
We found no studies which met our criteria for inclusion in this review. We recommend that future studies in this area consider the effect of magnifying reading aids on reading speed and accuracy as well as simply the size of text correctly seen, in order to assess more fully the effect of the reading aid on a child's normal function. We also recommend that the effect of the reading aid on the child's quality of life is investigated as this may have significant implications on its regular and/or long‐term use.
