Insufficient data to determine the efficacy of transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation for dementia 
Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) is rarely used for the treatment of dementia but has been studied in a number of randomized controlled trials. Although the available data suggests TENS may be beneficial for some neuropsychological and/or behavioural aspects of dementia insufficient data was available to these reviewers for definitive conclusions to be drawn.
