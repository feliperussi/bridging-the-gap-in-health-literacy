Corticosteroid injection for de Quervain's tenosynovitis
This summary of a Cochrane review presents what we know from research about the effect of Corticosteroid injections for de Quervain's tenosynovitis. 
This review shows that in people with de Quervain's tenosynovitis, 
We are uncertain whether Corticosteroid injections reduces pain because of the very low quality of the evidence. 
What is de Quervain's tenosynovitis and what are corticosteroid injections? 
De Quervain's tenosynovitis occurs when the tendon in your thumb and wrist becomes inflammed, painful and difficult to move.  A tendon is the part of your body that connects your muscles to your bones.  People with de Quervain's tenosynovitis have pain, tenderness, and swelling at the base of the thumb, especially when moving their wrist from side to side.    
Corticosteroid injections are shots with a needle into a joint (such as your wrist) or a tendon. Corticosteroids may work by reducing the inflammation of your wrist or thumb. The injection itself might also help to relieve the pressure on the tendon.
