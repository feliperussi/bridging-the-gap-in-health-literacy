There is currently no evidence of effects of heparin and related substances for preventing the onset of diabetic kidney disease (DKD) 
Heparin and related substances, including glycosaminoglycans, chondroitin, low‐molecular‐weight heparin (LMWH), heparinoids, heparitin sulfate, hyaluronic acid and keratan sulphate, have been demonstrated a few positive effects on delaying the progression of diabetic kidney disease (DKD). This review looked for randomised studies assessing the effect of heparin and related substances on preventing the onset of DKD. No study was available. Well designed and high quality randomised studies that address this issue are needed.
