Altered dietary salt for preventing pre‐eclampsia, and its complications
Low salt intake in pregnancy is unlikely to prevent pre‐eclampsia.
Pre‐eclampsia is a serious complication of pregnancy associated with poor health, or even death, for the mother and baby. Pre‐eclampsia is identified by raised blood pressure and protein in the urine during the second half of pregnancy. In the past, a low‐salt diet was often recommended, in the belief that it would help to prevent pre‐eclampsia. However, the review found just two trials that did not show any evidence of benefit for the mother or baby. Salt intake in pregnancy should be a matter of personal preference.
