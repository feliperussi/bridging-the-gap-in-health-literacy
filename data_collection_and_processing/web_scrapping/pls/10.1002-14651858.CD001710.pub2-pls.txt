Day centres for severe mental illness
The last 30 years have seen a large increase in the number of people with severe mental illness receiving treatment whilst living at home. Community care of the severely mentally ill is frequently enhanced by care provided by day centres run by non‐medical services (Social Services in the UK, or the charitable sector). In this review we sought, but could not find, any evidence from well‐conducted randomised trials of the effects of non‐medical day centres. Day centres are currently becoming prominent in service planning, but this is not based on good evidence as to their effectiveness for people suffering from severe mental illness. If a choice between facilities is available, people with serious mental illnesses and their carers are currently left to make their own judgements based on the evidence of experience and a few non‐randomised studies.
