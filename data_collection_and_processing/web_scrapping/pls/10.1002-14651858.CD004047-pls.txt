Drug treatments for dysthymia
Many drug treatments have been proposed for the treatment of dysthymia. There is a need to know whether the different classes of antidepressants have similar efficacy. The tolerability of treatments may be even more important, since dysthymia is a chronic condition characterised by less severe symptoms than major depression. A total of 14 trials were included in this review. All drugs promoted similar clinical responses, although with different side effect profiles. There are no significances differences in efficacy between different classes of antidepressants in the treatment of dysthymia, although side effect profiles may be different. The evidence for TCAs and SSRIs was the most robust. The conclusion is that the choice of drug must be made based on consideration of drug‚Äêspecific side effect properties.
