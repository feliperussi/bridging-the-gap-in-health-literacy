Protein restriction for diabetic renal disease
Based on 12 studies, including from eight to 160 people with type 1 and type 2 diabetes for at least an average four‐month period, restricted protein intake appeared to slow progression of diabetic kidney disease, but not by much on average. However, individual variation existed, therefore a low‐protein diet may benefit some individuals. A low‐protein diet can be difficult to adhere to, especially over the long term. Reducing the amount of animal protein is the usual method but some evidence suggests that a shift from red meat to white meat and fish or vegetables may give similar results. We found no data on the effects of low‐protein diet on health‐related quality of life and costs.
