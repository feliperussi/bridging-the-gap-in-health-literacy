Acupuncture for menopausal hot flushes
Review question: Is acupuncture safe and effective for reducing hot flushes and improving the quality of life of menopausal women with hot flushes? 
Background: Hot flushes are the most common symptoms related to perimenopause and menopause. Hormone therapy (HT) is considered to be the most effective treatment for symptoms. However, studies have reported that hormone therapies may have some negative health effects and many women are now choosing not to use these and are looking for alternatives such as acupuncture. Cochrane review authors examined the evidence, which is current to January 2013. 
Study characteristics: Sixteen randomized controlled trials, with 1155 women, were included in the review. Most were small and of short duration. 15 of the 16 included studies reported their funding sources. 
Key findings: When acupuncture was compared with sham acupuncture, there was no evidence of any difference in their effect on hot flushes. When acupuncture was compared with no treatment, there appeared to be a benefit from acupuncture, but acupuncture appeared to be less effective than HT. 
Quality of the evidence: These findings should be treated with great caution as the evidence was low or very low quality and the studies comparing acupuncture with no treatment or HT were not controlled with sham acupuncture or placebo HT. Data on adverse effects were lacking.
