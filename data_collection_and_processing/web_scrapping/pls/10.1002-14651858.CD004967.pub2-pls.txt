Not enough good quality trials to assess the most effective drug treatment for paracoccidioidomycosis
Paracoccidioidomycosis is a fungal infection that causes ulcers, swelling, fever, and pain. If it also gets into the lungs, it can produce coughing, shortage of breath, chest pain, weight loss, and sometimes death. Without treatment, those suffering this disease may die in a few months or years. There are endemic areas between Mexico and southern Argentina. Drug treatments need to go on for many months and maybe years. There are various drugs that are used, but this review found only two small trials with too few data to say which drug was best, and the drugs all seem to have adverse effects. More research is needed.
