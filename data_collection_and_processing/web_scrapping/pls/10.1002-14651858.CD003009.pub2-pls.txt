Neuroreflexotherapy for non‐specific low‐back pain
Neuroreflexotherapy, provided in specialized clinics in Spain, appears to reduce pain and disability for patients with chronic non‐specific low‐back pain. 
Clinicians use a wide range of treatments to manage chronic low back pain. There is often little scientific support that they work, or that they would be useful for a broader population. In this review, neuroreflexotherapy performed better than placebo or standard care. However, until research duplicates these results in different settings, there is no strong evidence that it will work as well outside the specialty clinics in Spain.
