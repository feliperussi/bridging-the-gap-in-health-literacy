Iron supplementation for the treatment of breath‐holding attacks in children
Iron may reduce the frequency and severity of breath‐holding attacks (or spells) in children but more research is needed to determine the extent of this effect. Breath‐holding attacks are a common disabling phenomenon during early childhood. They are distinct from seizures and it is common for them to spontaneously resolve by the time the child reaches seven years of age. This review of controlled clinical trials found that iron supplementation, which is generally well tolerated orally, may reduce the frequency and severity of breath‐holding attacks, particularly if the child is anaemic. It is not known if this benefit is sustained after three months or if iron therapy should be continued until the child grows out of the breath‐holding episodes.
