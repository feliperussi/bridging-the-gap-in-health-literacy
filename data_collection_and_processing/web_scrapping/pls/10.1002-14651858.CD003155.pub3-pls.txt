Metrifonate for Alzheimer's disease
Metrifonate cannot be recommended for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.
Metrifonate is a long‐acting irreversible cholinesterase inhibitor. We reviewed the evidence for its efficacy in Alzheimer's disease and assessed adverse events and tolerability. At various doses it was associated with significant cognitive improvement compared to placebo, improvement in clinical global impression, and activities of daily living. 
Neuromuscular dysfunction with life‐threatening respiratory failure and death was reported by the pharmaceutical company and FDA, and the drug will not be further developed.
