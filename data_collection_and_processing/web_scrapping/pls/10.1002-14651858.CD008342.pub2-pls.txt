Prophylactic vitamin K for the prevention of vitamin K deficiency bleeding in preterm neonates 
Review question 
Is vitamin K prophylaxis effective in preventing vitamin K deficiency bleeding (VKBD) in preterm infants? 
Background 
Preterm infants are potentially at greater risk for VKBD because of delays in feeding and, therefore, delays in colonization of the intestine with vitamin K producing bacteria as well as immaturity of liver function and clotting function of the blood. Preterm infants are routinely given prophylactic vitamin K through intravenous or intramuscular routes. 
Study characteristics 
In searches completed up to 5 December 2016, we found no studies in preterm infants that compare prophylactic vitamin K to non treatment and one study that compared dosage and route of vitamin K administration. 
Key results 
One study met the inclusion criteria compared dosage and route of administration. This study suggests that both intravenous and intramuscular routes are adequate in achieving measurable vitamin K levels and that doses as low as 0.2 mg lead to measurable levels of vitamin K without evidence of the protein induced by vitamin K deficiency. More high‚Äêquality studies are needed to determine the best dose and route to give preterm infants vitamin K. 
Quality of evidence 
Low quality evidence.
