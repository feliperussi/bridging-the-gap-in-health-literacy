Chinese medicinal herbs for acute bronchitis
We assessed the therapeutic effect of traditional Chinese herbal medicines commonly used in China for acute bronchitis. There is no evidence from randomised controlled trials (RCTs) to demonstrate that Chinese medicinal herbs are efficacious in treating acute bronchitis. 
We identified 74 studies involving 6877 participants which reported to randomly allocate participants to their treatment groups. However, we did not identify any true RCTs for inclusion. The common reasons for exclusion were a potential high risk of selection bias and conflict of interest. These design limitations resulted in us being unable to draw conclusions on the effects of Chinese herbal medicines for acute bronchitis. In addition, the safety of Chinese medicinal herbs is unknown due to the lack of toxicological evidence, although some adverse events, for example, slight gastrointestinal reactions, skin rash, etc., were reported in some case reports but not in the so called 'random' studies which we excluded. High quality RCTs are needed in the future.
