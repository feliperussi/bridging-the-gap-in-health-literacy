Botulinum toxin injectable drug for myofascial pain syndrome (a painful condition that could affect any muscle in the body) in adults 
Myofascial pain syndrome (MPS) is a regional muscular pain syndrome characterised by the presence of trigger points (painful points) in one or more muscles. The pain can be at the trigger point site or it can be felt away from that point when the muscle is pressed, which is called referred pain. Botulinum toxin is a potent chemical that blocks the communication between nerves and muscles and inhibits muscle contractions in the muscles where the trigger points are located, which may result in pain relief when it is injected into the area. The purpose of this review was to assess how effective botulinum toxin is at reducing pain in patients with MPS. We identified four studies, with 233 participants, comparing botulinum toxin A with placebo (control group). There was inconclusive evidence to support the use of botulinum toxin in the treatment of MPS. More high‚Äêquality randomised controlled trials of botulinum toxin for treating MPS need to be conducted before firm conclusions on its effectiveness and safety can be drawn.
