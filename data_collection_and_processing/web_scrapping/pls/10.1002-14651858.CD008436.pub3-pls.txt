Early removal versus expectant management of central venous catheters in newborn infants with bloodstream infection 
Review question: In newborn infants with a bloodstream infection who have a central venous catheter in place, does early removal of the catheter reduce the risk of complications, including death and long‐term disability? 
Background: Infection in the bloodstream is a frequent and harmful complication for newborn infants who have a central venous catheter (a cannula that extends several centimetres into the infant's blood vessels). Bloodstream infection may cause death and disability. When infants develop a bloodstream infection, clinicians need to decide whether or not to remove the catheter. While the catheter may provide a secure route for delivering drugs and nutrition, it may also be a place for infecting organisms to grow and cause long‐term or more severe infection. 
Study characteristics/key results: We did not find any randomised controlled trials that addressed this question. 
Conclusions: There are no trial data available to help clinicians to address this common clinical dilemma. Due to the potential for benefit and harm, such a trial is warranted.
