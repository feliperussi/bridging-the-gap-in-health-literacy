Role of ketamine for management of acute severe asthma in children
Children frequently visit the emergency department for acute exacerbation of asthma. Some of these children fail to respond to standard treatment (corticosteroids and bronchodilators) with increased morbidity. Ketamine has bronchodilatory properties and may be useful for acute exacerbation of asthma. We evaluated the efficacy of ketamine for management of severe acute asthma in children who had not responded to standard therapy. We found, through systematic search, only one study where investigators assessed the usefulness of ketamine for management of severe acute asthma in children. While this single study suggested that there is a lack of evidence for usefulness of ketamine in acute exacerbation of asthma in children, more trials are needed regarding the use of ketamine in acute asthma before more specific recommendations can be made.
