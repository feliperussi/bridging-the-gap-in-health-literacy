Umbilical artery catheters in the newborn: effects of position of the catheter tip
High positioning of umbilical artery catheters in babies in neonatal intensive care leads to fewer complications than low positioning. The umbilical artery catheters (tubes) (UACs) commonly used in neonatal intensive care to monitor babies, can sometimes cause them problems. They can be used with different accompanying doses of the drug heparin, and different catheter materials and design. The catheter can also be placed in a low or high position. This review found that high catheter positions led to fewer complications, and reduced the need for replacement and re‚Äêinsertion of catheters.
