Propofol for sedation during colonoscopy can lead to faster recovery after the procedure and higher patient satisfaction. 
Irrespective of the initial screening test, colonoscopy is the final step in colorectal cancer screening. With the advent of the colorectal cancer screening programs in many countries, an increasing number of colonoscopies are being performed each year. Sedation for colonoscopy can improve patients' tolerance of the procedure and enhance colonoscopy completion rates. There is no consensus on the preferred drugs for sedation during colonoscopy. This review found that use of propofol for sedation during colonoscopy can lead to faster recovery after the procedure and higher patient satisfaction, without any increase in side‚Äêeffects as compared to the use of drugs traditionally used (narcotics and/or benzodiazepines) for sedation during colonoscopy.
