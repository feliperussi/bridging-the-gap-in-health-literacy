Doubtful effect of lecithin as a treatment for dementia
Lecithin is a major dietary source of choline, a substance that may theoretically improve brain functioning in people with dementia or similar problems (including Alzheimer's disease). This review did not find any evidence that lecithin does have a benefit for patients with Alzheimer's disease or other forms of dementia. However, one small study has observed a dramatic benefit of lecithin in people with subjective memory problems, but there are no similar studies with which to compare it.
