Hormones for suspected impaired fetal growth
No evidence to show whether the unborn baby's growth improves when pregnant women take extra oestrogen. 
Babies in the womb growing more slowly than expected (impaired fetal growth) may be receiving too few nutrients from their mother's blood. Hormones are chemicals produced by glands in the body for growth, metabolism (how the body uses food) and reproduction. Oestrogen (the female hormone) is thought to increase blood flow from pregnant women to their babies, thus potentially providing more nutrients. The review of trials has found no evidence to show whether the baby's growth improves when pregnant women take extra oestrogen. There is no evidence from trials on the effects of oestrogen supplementation on women and their babies.
