Interventions for educating traditional healers about STD and HIV medicine
There is a strong argument for the importance of collaborating with traditional healers in the management of STIs such as HIV/AIDS. Political and health care systems have failed adequately to cope with the pandemic, and engaging every available resource is therefore crucial. One such potential resource is treatment by traditional healers. Certain traditional healer practices, however, could contribute to the spread of HIV/AIDS. Training and educational programmes have been developed as a possible way to improve traditional healer practices. 
This review found four studies that evaluated the effectiveness of HIV/AIDS training programs aimed at traditional healers; information about two of these studies is not yet available. Both of these studies found that workshops improved traditional healer knowledge about HIV/AIDS. However, an assessment of behaviour change in one study found that a training program improved traditional healer behaviour in terms of managing patients, but not in reducing risky behaviours and referral practices. 
Although the studies evaluated reported some positive outcomes, they were not of high quality. It is therefore difficult to be certain about the efficacy of interventions for educating traditional healers in the fundamentals of STI and HIV medicine.
