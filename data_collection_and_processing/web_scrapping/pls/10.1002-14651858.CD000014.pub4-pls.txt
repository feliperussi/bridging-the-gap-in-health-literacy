Amnioinfusion for meconium‚Äêstained liquor in labour
Amnioinfusion is not beneficial for babies releasing medium to heavy meconium during labour, except in settings with limited facilities to monitor the baby's condition during labour. 
A bowel movement (meconium) from the unborn baby during labour can enter the baby's lungs, causing breathing difficulties after birth. Extra liquid can be injected through the woman's vagina or abdomen into the womb (amnioinfusion) to provide more liquid to dilute the meconium and surround the baby. The review of 14 trials (4435 women) found that amnioinfusion with a salt (saline) solution is beneficial for babies only in settings in which babies are at high risk due to limited monitoring facilities. Further research into the effects on women is needed.
