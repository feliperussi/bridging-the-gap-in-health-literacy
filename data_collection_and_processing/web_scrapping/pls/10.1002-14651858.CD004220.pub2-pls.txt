Thyroid hormone supplementation for the prevention of morbidity and mortality in infants undergoing cardiac surgery 
There is insufficient evidence to advocate the use of triiodothyronine supplementation for the prevention of postoperative morbidity and mortality in infants who undergo cardiopulmonary bypass.Thyroid hormones are integral in cellular metabolism and haemodynamic stability. A transient acquired hypothyroidism occurs after cardiopulmonary bypass and is thought to be associated with low cardiac output, left ventricular dysfunction, increased vascular resistance and impaired ventilatory drives. Thyroid hormone supplementation has been postulated as a possible therapeutic option to improve postoperative outcome measures. This review highlights the lack of evidence concerning the benefits and harms of triiodothyronine supplementation in infants who undergo cardiopulmonary bypass.
