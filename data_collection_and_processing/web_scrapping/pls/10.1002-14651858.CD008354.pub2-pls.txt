Endothelin receptor antagonists for subarachnoid hemorrhage
Subarachnoid hemorrhage is an uncommon cause of stroke that often occurs at a young age, producing a relatively large burden of premature mortality. Delayed ischemic neurological deficit (DIND), a condition where the patient's condition deteriorates, has long been recognized as the leading potentially treatable cause of death and disability in patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage. Endothelin is a long‚Äêlasting agent that causes blood vessel constriction, which has been implicated in the cause of DIND. Drugs that reverse this effect (endothelin receptor antagonists, ETAs) have emerged as a promising treatment for subarachnoid hemorrhage. This review of four trials, involving 2024 participants, showed that ETAs reduced the risk of DIND but did not improve clinical outcomes and had potentially serious side effects, such as low blood pressure and chest infection. There is not enough evidence to conclude that ETAs are beneficial in SAH.
