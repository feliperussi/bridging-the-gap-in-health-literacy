Amnioinfusion for potential or suspected umbilical cord compression in labour
Infusing fluid into the uterus during labour may reduce fetal heart rate abnormalities and reduce caesarean sections. 
Most women have adequate amniotic fluid to protect their baby during pregnancy and labour. Occasionally the volume of amniotic fluid is reduced, and this may cause compression of the umbilical cord. This in turn might lead to intermittent slowing of the baby's heart rate during labour. Infusing fluid into the uterus through a catheter placed through the cervix, or a needle through the abdomen may reduce this problem and the incidence of caesarean section. In addition, it may improve the newborn baby's condition at birth and prevent infection of the womb. The 19 studies reviewed were of average quality, and too small to measure the risk of rare complications for the mother; all but two studies had fewer than 200 participants.
