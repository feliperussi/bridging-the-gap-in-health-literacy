Replacement of estrogens and progestins to prevent morbidity and mortality in preterm infants 
Preterm infants commonly have low levels of sex steroids (estrogen and progesterone) because of lack of placental supply. It is suggested that estrogens and progestins have a role in normal development. However, risks of giving sex hormones include abnormalities in babies such as vaginal cancers and narrowing of the urinary passage. The review authors searched the medical literature and found only one small controlled trial. Thirty female low birthweight preterm infants (less than 29 weeks gestational age and weighing less than 1000 g) were given combined estrogen (estradiol) and progesterone or placebo in the first six weeks of their life. There were no clinical benefits found with giving the sex hormones or any adverse effects during the study. The measured levels of estrogen and progesterone were similar to those found in babies in the womb.
