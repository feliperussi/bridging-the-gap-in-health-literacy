People who undergo ureteroscopy for the treatment of stones achieve a higher stone‐free rate, but have more complications and longer hospital stay 
Ureteral stones (kidney stones that move down the ureter) frequently lead to renal colic, causing pain, and if left untreated, can block the urinary tract (obstructive uropathy). Both ureteroscopy (an examination by a doctor to see inside the urinary tract) and extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL, a procedure that uses high‐energy shockwave to break up stones into small particles that are passed out of the body in urine) achieve high success rates in managing ureteric stone disease. We analysed reports from seven randomised controlled trials of 1205 patients and found that ureteroscopy provided a better stone‐free rate after treatment, but patients had to stay in hospital longer, and there was a higher risk of complications. We found that there were many variations among the seven studies in their design, duration, and data collected which made comparison and evaluation challenging. We recommend that further evaluation and research is conducted to ensure that new and improved treatments and studies are considered to inform clinical practice.
