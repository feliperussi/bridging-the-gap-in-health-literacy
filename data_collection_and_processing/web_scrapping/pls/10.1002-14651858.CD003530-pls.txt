The effects of beclomethasone or budesonide for chronic asthma
Beclomethasone and budesonide are commonly used to treat people with asthma in the long‚Äêterm. Despite the large amount of research which has been conducted with these two steroids, very little can be concluded as to how effective they are, because the quality of the research to date has not been strong enough. The available research does not therefore provide a clear answer as to whether beclomethasone or budesonide are better for treating asthma.
