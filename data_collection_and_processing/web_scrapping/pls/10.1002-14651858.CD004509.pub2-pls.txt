Testosterone for perimenopausal and postmenopausal women
There is good evidence that adding testosterone to hormone therapy (HT) has a beneficial effect on sexual function in postmenopausal women. However, the combined therapy is associated with a higher incidence of hair growth and acne and a reduction in high‚Äêdensity lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol. These adverse events may vary with different doses and routes of administration of testosterone. Adding testosterone to HT did not increase the number of women who stopped HT therapy.
