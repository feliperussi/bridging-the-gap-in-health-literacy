Proteins in blood and cerebrospinal fluids for early prediction of developing Alzheimer’s disease or other dementia in people with cognitive problems 
The numbers of people with dementia and other cognitive problems are increasing globally. A diagnosis of the pre‐dementia phase of disease is recommended but there is no agreement on the best approach. A range of tests have been developed which healthcare professionals can use to assess people with poor memory or cognitive impairment. In this review, however, we have found that measuring protein in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF amyloid beta (Aβ40) or CSF Aβ42), as a single test, lacks the accuracy to identify those patients with mild cognitive impairment who would develop Alzheimer's disease dementia or other forms of dementia.
