Local corticosteroid injection is effective in the short‐term for the treatment of carpal tunnel syndrome 
Local corticosteroid injection is a common non‐surgical treatment for carpal tunnel syndrome. Other non‐surgical treatments include the use of wrist splints, ultrasound and oral anti‐inflammatory agents. Surgical intervention is also known to be effective. This systematic review confirmed the effectiveness of local corticosteroid injection for relief of symptoms for severe carpal tunnel syndrome up to one month after injection. Local corticosteroid injection provides significantly greater clinical improvement compared to oral corticosteroid up to three months after treatment. Two injections of local corticosteroid do not provide significant further clinical improvement of symptoms. Further research is required to determine length of benefit of local corticosteroid injection and benefit for mild and moderate carpal tunnel syndrome.
