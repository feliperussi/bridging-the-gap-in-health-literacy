Chest shielding to prevent patent ductus arteriosus in preterm infants receiving phototherapy
Review question 
Does the use of chest shielding in preterm infants receiving phototherapy reduce the incidence of clinically and/or haemodynamically significant patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) and reduce morbidity secondary to PDA? 
Background 
The ductus arteriosus is a fetal blood vessel that usually closes spontaneously after birth. However, in approximately 30% of infants born before 30 weeks gestation the vessel remains open (known as patent ductus arteriosus, or PDA), and the infant has problems with excess blood flow to the lungs, shunting of blood away from organs, and heart failure. Phototherapy is a common treatment for jaundice in preterm infants. However, phototherapy has been associated with failure of the closure of the ductus arteriosus in preterm infants. 
Study characteristics 
Two small randomised trials.
Results 
We included two trials and reported conflicting evidence regarding the effect of shielding on the ductus arterious. They had substantial methodological differences. 
The results of this review did not provide sufficient evidence to determine the effectiveness of chest shielding to prevent PDA in preterm infants receiving phototherapy.
