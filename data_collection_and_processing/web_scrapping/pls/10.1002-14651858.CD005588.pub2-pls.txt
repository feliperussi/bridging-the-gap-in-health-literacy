Magnesium sulfate for persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn
The blood pressure in the arteries of the lungs (pulmonary arteries) is normally much lower than the blood pressure in the rest of the body. Before a baby is born the muscle surrounding the pulmonary arteries is tightly constricted resulting in a very high pressure in these arteries. After birth the arteries dilate and the pressure drops. In persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn this drop in pulmonary blood pressure, for a variety of reasons, fails to occur. 
Magnesium sulfate is able to dilate constricted muscles of the type in the pulmonary arteries. However, its action is not specific and when given via an intravenous infusion, it will act on other muscles in the body including other arteries. This means that even if it were found to be effective in pulmonary hypertension, unwanted actions in other parts of the body might be a problem. 
This review found that the use of magnesium sulfate for persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn has not been tested by randomized controlled trials. Evidence from uncontrolled studies is extremely limited but since the little evidence that does exist suggests a potential benefit, randomized controlled trials are recommended.Â
