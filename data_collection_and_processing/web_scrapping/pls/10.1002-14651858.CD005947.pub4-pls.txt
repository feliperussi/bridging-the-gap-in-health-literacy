Glutamine supplementation for young infants with severe gastrointestinal disease
Glutamine is an amino acid that helps tissues, particularly in the gastrointestinal tract, recover from damage. We looked for evidence that giving extra glutamine to young infants with severe bowel problems helps them to recover faster and more fully. At present, only three trials are available; results suggest that supplemental glutamine has no benefit for these infants.
