Immunomodulatory interventions (treatments that target the immune system) for focal epilepsy syndromes 
Epilepsy is a common neurological condition affecting approximately 50 million people worldwide. We still do not fully understand the mechanisms by which the brain becomes epileptic. Recently, it has been suggested that the immune system and how it responds to injury may play an important role in this process. We identified a single randomised controlled trial of a treatment that targets the immune system. The results of the trial suggest that this treatment (called intravenous immunoglobulin therapy) may be effective in reducing seizure frequency in some patients with epilepsy (on the basis of a global blind assessment including various methods for assessing seizures and quality of life) but more trials are necessary before any definite conclusions and recommendations can be made.
