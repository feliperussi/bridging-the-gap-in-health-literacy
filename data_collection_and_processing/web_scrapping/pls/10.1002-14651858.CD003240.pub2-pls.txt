Day hospital versus outpatient care for people with schizophrenia
Psychiatric day hospitals offer care that is less restrictive than inpatient care but more intense than outpatient care. Day hospitals can be used to provide more intense/specialised outpatient care to people resistant to treatment (day treatment programmes) or to those needing long‚Äêterm care (day care centres). They can also bridge the gap between inpatient and outpatient care (transitional day hospitals). This review compared day hospital care (in day treatment centres and transitional day hospitals) to outpatient care. Overall there was insufficient evidence to determine whether any of the three types of day hospital care had substantial advantages over outpatient care.
