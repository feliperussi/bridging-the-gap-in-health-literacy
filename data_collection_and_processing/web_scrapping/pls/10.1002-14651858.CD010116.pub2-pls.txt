Occupational therapy for care home residents with stroke
Stroke is the leading cause of disability worldwide and is prevalent in the care home population. Whilst care home residents with stroke are likely to be more impaired and dependent than those with stroke residing in their own homes, they are less likely to receive ongoing stroke specialist rehabilitation such as occupational therapy. Occupational therapy aims to help people achieve their maximum level of independence in everyday activities. Evidence can be found to support the benefits of occupational therapy for community‐dwelling stroke survivors. However, the care home population with stroke differs from the community‐dwelling population. For example, they are more likely to have high levels of immobility, incontinence and confusion, along with other co‐morbidities. This review of one trial including 118 participants found that evidence is currently insufficient to conclusively state the benefits of occupational therapy for care home residents with stroke. Additional randomised controlled trials that test occupational therapy interventions for care home residents with stroke are needed. One such trial is currently ongoing.
