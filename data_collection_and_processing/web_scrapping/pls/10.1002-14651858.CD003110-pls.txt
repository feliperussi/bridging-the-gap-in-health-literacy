Area‐wide traffic calming (such as introducing road/speed humps) may reduce death and injury from road traffic crashes but more research is needed 
Road traffic crashes are a major problem worldwide. In high‐income countries, traffic calming schemes aim to make the roads safer (particularly for vulnerable road users such as pedestrians and cyclists) in areas that are particular 'hot spots'. Strategies include slowing down traffic (eg road/speed humps, mini‐roundabouts, reduced speed limit zones), visual changes (road surface treatment, changes to road lighting), redistributing traffic (blocking roads, creating one‐way streets), and/or changes to road environments (such as trees). This review found that area‐wide traffic calming may have the potential to reduce death and injuries, but more research is needed particularly in low and middle income countries.
