Single dose oral mefenamic acid for acute postoperative pain in adults
Mefenamic acid is a non‐steroidal anti‐inflammatory drug (NSAID) that is used as a painkiller (analgesic). Four studies involving a total of 842 participants were included in this review. Because fewer than 200 participants were treated with mefenamic acid within these four studies, results must be treated with caution. A good level of pain relief is experienced by almost half (48%) of those with moderate to severe postoperative pain after a single dose of mefenamic acid 500 mg, compared to about 20% with placebo, and fewer will need additional analgesia within 6 hours (47% versus 62%). This level of pain relief is comparable to that experienced with paracetamol 1000 mg. Adverse events could not be assessed in these studies.
