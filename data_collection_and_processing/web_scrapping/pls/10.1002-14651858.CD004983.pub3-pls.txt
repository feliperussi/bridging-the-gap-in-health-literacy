Wound cleansing to help pressure ulcers heal.
Pressure ulcers (also called pressure sores, bed sores and decubitus ulcers) are areas of tissue damage that occur in the elderly, malnourished or acutely ill, who cannot reposition themselves. The three trials identified found no good evidence that cleansing pressure ulcers (bed sores) using a particular technique, or cleansing with a particular solution, helps healing. Very little research has studied the cleansing of pressure ulcers and therefore we are unable to draw any firm conclusions.
