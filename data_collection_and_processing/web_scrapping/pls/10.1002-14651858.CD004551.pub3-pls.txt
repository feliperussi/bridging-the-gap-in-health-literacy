Methods of pin site care for reducing infection and complications associated with external bone fixators and pins 
Metal pins are sometimes used to apply traction or to attach other external fixation devices into broken arms or legs. These pins pierce through the skin. The way they are cared for may affect the frequency of infection. Different solutions are used for cleaning around pins, different dressings can be used, scabs may or may not be removed and massage might be used to drain fluids around them. Few clinical trials have investigated this area, and they were of poor quality. As a result, this review found no strong evidence that one pin care technique was better than any other for reducing the chance of infection and other complications.
