The ligasure technique is superior in terms of patient tolerance, but long term risk of recurrence of hemorrhoids needs to be evaluated. 
Hemorrhoidectomy is a frequently performed surgical procedure. The excisional technique is regarded to be the first choice for grade III and IV or recurrent hemorrhoids. As conventional hemorrhoidectomy is associated with postprocedural pain, modifications have been proposed to diminish this complication. An example is the use of the Ligasure as coagulation between the forceps only with high frequency currency and active feedback control over the power output has minimal thermal spread and limited tissue charring. This could result in a decreased incidence of postoperative pain.
