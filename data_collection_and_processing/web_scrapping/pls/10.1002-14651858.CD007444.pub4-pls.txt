Preparing the cervix with nitric oxide donors before surgical abortion in the first three months of pregnancy 
Possible complications of surgical abortion in the first three months of pregnancy include injury to the cervix (the neck of the womb) and the womb itself. Preparing the cervix before surgery might make the procedure safer and easier. Several methods are used to prepare the cervix. This review compared drugs known as nitric oxide (NO) donors with other drugs. 
We did a computer search for randomised trials of NO donors used before surgical abortion. We found that NO donors are better than placebo (a sugar pill). Prostaglandins are better than NO donors for preparing the cervix.
