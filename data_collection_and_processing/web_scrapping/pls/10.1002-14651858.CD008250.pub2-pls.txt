Breathing exercises for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
People with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) often have an altered breathing pattern and experience shortness of breath, particularly when they exercise. This review aimed to determine whether breathing exercises that are designed to retrain the breathing pattern could reduce breathlessness, increase exercise capacity and improve well being for people with COPD. 
Sixteen trials with 1233 participants were included, most of whom had severe COPD. The breathing techniques studied included pursed lip breathing (breathing out slowly with the lips in a whistling position), diaphragmatic breathing (deep breathing focusing on the abdomen), pranayam yoga breathing (timed breathing with a focus on exhalation), changing the breathing pattern using computerised feedback to slow the respiratory rate and increase exhalation time, or combinations of these techniques. The study quality was generally low. Breathing exercises appeared to be safe for people with COPD. Yoga breathing, pursed lip breathing and diaphragmatic breathing improved the distance walked in six minutes by an average of 35 to 50 metres in four studies. Effects of breathing exercises on shortness of breath and well being were variable. When added to whole body exercise training, breathing exercises did not appear to have any additional benefit.
