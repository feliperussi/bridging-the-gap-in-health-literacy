Botulinum toxin injections into the bladder for overactive bladder syndrome in adults
Injection of botulinum toxin into the bladder is being increasingly used to treat persistent overactive bladder (OAB). This is a disorder characterised by the sudden urge to pass urine with or without incontinence, a frequent need to pass urine, and waking to pass urine during the night. We explored the research relating to how effective and safe botulinum toxin injections into the bladder are, and what the best dose of botulinum toxin is, and what is the best way of injecting it into the bladder. We found that there were several comparative studies, but these involved a relatively small number of patients. There was evidence that botulinum toxin improves the symptoms of OAB. It was unclear what the best dose of botulinum toxin was. Botulinum toxin injections into the bladder appeared to give few side effects or complications, but there were no long‐term follow‐up studies, and there could be rare side effects that have not been discovered yet.
