Benzodiazepines for neuroleptic‚Äêinduced acute akathisia
Akathisia is a common and distressing adverse effect of many antipsychotic drugs. It is characterised by restlessness and mental unease, which can be intense. It is associated with patterns of restless, including rocking, walking on the spot when standing, shuffling, or swinging one leg on the other when sitting. People may constantly pace up and down in an attempt to relieve the sense of unrest. Several strategies have been used to decrease akathisia, and this review is one in a series over viewing the effects of drug treatments. Evidence for the use of benzodiazepines is so limited that no firm treatment recommendations are possible, although there may be some effects that are worthy of further investigation.
