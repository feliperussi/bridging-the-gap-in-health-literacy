Animal derived surfactant compared to protein‐free synthetic surfactant preparations in preterm infants that have or are at high risk for respiratory distress syndrome. 
Review question: Does the use of animal derived surfactant preparations compared to synthetic surfactant preparations that do not contain protein lead to improved outcome in infants at risk for or having respiratory distress syndrome? 
Background: Pulmonary surfactant is a substance that prevents the air sacs of the lungs from collapsing by reducing surface tension. Newborn babies with respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) have immature lungs and are often lacking in pulmonary surfactant. Commercially available surfactant preparations (either animal derived surfactant preparations or synthetic surfactant preparations that may or may not contain protein) can be given to these babies and have been proven to decrease the severity of RDS and increase the survival rates of babies with RDS. However, it is unclear whether significant differences in clinical outcome exist among the available animal derived surfactant preparations or the protein‐free synthetic surfactant preparations. 
Study characteristics: Fifteen randomized controlled trials met our inclusion criteria.
Results: This review of trials compared animal derived surfactant extracts with synthetic surfactants that did not contain protein and found a decrease in the risk of pneumothorax (air in the lung cavity) and death in babies receiving animal derived surfactant extracts. 
Some evidence that animal derived surfactant extract leads to better outcomes in babies with respiratory distress syndrome compared to synthetic surfactants that do not contains proteins.
