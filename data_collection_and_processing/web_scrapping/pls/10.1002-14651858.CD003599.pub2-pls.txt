Diuretics for the treatment of Ménière's disease or syndrome
Diuretics (drugs which reduce fluid accumulation in the body) are commonly used in the management of the symptoms of vertigo, hearing loss, tinnitus or aural fullness in patients with Ménière's disease. 'Endolymphatic hydrops' is an increase in the pressure of the fluids in the chambers of the inner ear and is thought to be the underlying cause of Ménière's disease. Diuretics are believed to work by reducing the volume (and therefore also the pressure) of these fluids. The authors of this systematic review carried out an extensive search but could not identify any randomised controlled trials of sufficient quality to include in the review. There is no good evidence about the effect of diuretics on the symptoms of Ménière's disease and further research is needed.
