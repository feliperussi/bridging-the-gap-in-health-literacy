No evidence of benefit from vitamin B6 supplementation on mood or cognition of older people with normal vitamin B6 status or with vitamin B6 deficiency 
Micronutrient status can affect cognitive function at all ages. Vitamin deficiencies could influence memory function and might contribute to age‚Äêassociated cognitive impairment and dementia. Vitamin B6 is involved in the regulation of mental function and mood and in the metabolism of homocysteine, a risk factor for vascular disease. Two trials of vitamin B6 supplements for healthy elderly people qualified for this review, with no beneficial effects on mood or mental function detectable. Homocysteine levels were not assessed. No ill effects of vitamin B6 were observed. No trials studying effects of vitamin B6 treatment for people with dementia or cognitive impairment were identified.
