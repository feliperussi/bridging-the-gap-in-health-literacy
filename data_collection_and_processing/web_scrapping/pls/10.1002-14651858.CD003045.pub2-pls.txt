No evidence to support anabolic‐androgenic steroids for alcoholic liver disease
Alcohol causes a major part of the liver diseases in the Western World. Several trials have addressed the effects of anabolic‐androgenic steroids for alcoholic liver disease. This systematic review could not demonstrate any significant effects of anabolic‐androgenic steroids on mortality, liver‐related mortality, liver complications, and histology of patients with alcoholic liver disease. Anabolic‐androgenic steroid intervention is not associated with a significant increase in non‐serious adverse events, but with the seldom occurrence of serious adverse events. Accordingly, there is no evidence supporting the use of anabolic‐androgenic steroids for alcoholic liver disease, but further randomised clinical trials may be needed to settle the question.
