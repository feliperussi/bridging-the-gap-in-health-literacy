Does physical exercise have beneficial or harmful effects in cirrhosis?
Background 
Prolonged damage of the liver can cause scar tissue formation, which ultimately replaces healthy liver tissue and results in chronic damage (cirrhosis). People with cirrhosis often suffer loss of muscle mass and muscle strength. Therefore, physical exercise may be beneficial to people with cirrhosis. 
Review question 
We investigated the beneficial and harmful effects of physical exercise compared with sham exercise (for example, supervised relaxation sessions) or no exercise for people with cirrhosis.

Study funding sources 
None of the included trials received industry funding or support from the pharmaceutical or device industry. 
Study characteristics 
We included six randomised clinical trials (where people are randomly allocated to one of two groups) with 173 participants. All participants had cirrhosis. Interventions consisted of different types of exercise including bicycling, treadmill walking, and weight lifting. Programmes were home‚Äêbased or supervised and lasted between eight and 14 weeks. 
Key results 
Physical exercise did not seem to affect mortality (death), side effects or quality of life. 
Quality of the evidence 
Overall, the evidence for the effect of physical exercise was of low or very low quality. Factors that downgraded the quality of the evidence included lack of trials with a low risk of bias, small trials, and not similar results across trials.
