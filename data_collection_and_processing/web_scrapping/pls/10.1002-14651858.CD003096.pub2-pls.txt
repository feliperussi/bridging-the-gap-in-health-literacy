Hydration for treatment of preterm labour
Unless they are dehydrated, there seems to be no benefit from additional intravenous fluids for women in preterm labour. 
Preterm birth (before 37 weeks) can cause health problems and be life‚Äêthreatening for babies. As women in preterm labour often have lower amounts of fluid in their circulation, using an intravenous drip to increase the woman's blood volume is sometimes tried (hydration). It has been hoped that the extra fluid might somehow slow down contractions. However, from the limited information available (two studies involving 228 women), the review found that there is no evidence of a benefit in the use of hydration to help prevent preterm labour, although it may be helpful for women who are dehydrated.
