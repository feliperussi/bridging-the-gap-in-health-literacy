Catheter lock treatments for catheter‐related infections in children with cancer
Oncology patients require frequent venous access for their cancer treatment. Therefore, more permanent catheters (central venous catheters (CVCs)) are often inserted. However, these can become infected and once the CVC becomes occupied by bacteria it is difficult to eradicate these micro‐organisms. Lock solutions are medicines that are placed in the CVC and left to dwell for a certain time period. These locks only treat the CVC and high concentrations can be achieved. In this review we investigated the effect of lock treatments on CVC‐related infections. We identified three studies: two investigating the effect of urokinase lock treatments in addition to antibiotics and one study investigating the effect of ethanol locks in addition to antibiotics. We could detect no effect of urokinase or ethanol locks. However, the groups were very small. A similar study with a larger participant population might have different results.
