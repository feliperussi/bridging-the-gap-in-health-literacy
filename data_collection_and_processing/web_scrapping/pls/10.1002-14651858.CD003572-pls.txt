No randomised trials were found testing short‐acting beta‐2 agonists in people with bronchiectasis. 
Bronchiectasis is characterised by the build up of mucus in the lungs which can result from other airways disease such as childhood pneumonia or tuberculosis. Medical treatment for bronchiectasis includes physiotherapy, antibiotics and occasionally mucolytics (drugs which are used to try and clear the mucus in the lungs). Since many people with bronchiectasis show signs of poor airflow, bronchodilator therapy such as reliever inhalers is frequently prescribed. Currently there are no randomised controlled trials that investigate the role of these bronchodilators in bronchiectasis. Since short acting beta‐2 agonist therapy is the most frequently used treatment for airflow obstruction in this condition, there appears to be a very great need to investigate the effectiveness of such therapy in clinical trials.
