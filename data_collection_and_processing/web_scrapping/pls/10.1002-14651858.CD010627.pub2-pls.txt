Using medications (antimetabolites) to avoid scarring after cataract surgery, which might cause failure of a previous glaucoma operation 
Review question: We reviewed the evidence on the effect of using medications (antimetabolites) to avoid scarring after cataract surgery, which might cause failure of a previous glaucoma operation. We did not find any trials to include in this review. 
Background: Patients with glaucoma who have had an operation to improve the pressure in their eyes often need a further operation to remove cataracts. Antimetabolites to prevent scarring can be used during the cataract operation with the intention of preventing failure of the previous glaucoma operation. 
Search date: The evidence is current to 10 June 2014. 
Key results: We did not find any trials to include in this review.
