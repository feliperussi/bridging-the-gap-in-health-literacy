Interventions for improving adherence to treatment recommendations in people with type 2 diabetes mellitus 
Twenty‚Äêone studies assessing interventions to improve adherence to treatment recommendations, not to diet or exercise, in people with type 2 diabetes in different settings (outpatients, community, hospitals, primary care) were included. There were many outcomes evaluated in these studies and a variety of adherence measurement instruments was used. Nurse led interventions, home aids, diabetes education and pharmacy led interventions showed a very small effect on some outcomes including metabolic control. No data on mortality or morbidity, nor on quality of life could be found.
