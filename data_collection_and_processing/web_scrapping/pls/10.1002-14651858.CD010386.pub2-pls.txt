11C‐PIB‐PET scan for early prediction of developing Alzheimer’s disease or other dementia in people with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) 
The numbers of people with dementia and other cognitive problems are increasing globally. A diagnosis of the pre‐dementia phase of disease is recommended but there is no agreement on the best approach. A range of tests have been developed which healthcare professionals can use to assess people with poor memory or cognitive impairment. Based on the published data, we have found that the 11C‐PIB‐PET scan as a single test lacks the accuracy to identify those patients with MCI who would develop Alzheimer's disease dementia or other forms of dementia. The findings indicate that for every 100 PIB scans, one person with a negative scan will progress to Alzheimer's disease dementia and 28 with a positive scan will not. Therefore, a positive PIB scan in patients with MCI is of no clinical value in the early prediction of Alzheimer's disease dementia developing.
