Interventions for treating oral mucositis for patients with cancer receiving treatment
Using a low level laser may reduce the severity of ulcers caused by cancer treatment.  Treatments for cancer can cause severe ulcers (sores) in the mouth. These can be painful and slow to heal. The review found some evidence that using a laser relieves or cures the ulcers. Morphine can control the pain. Although using morphine automatically on a constant drip, or self controlled use, provide similar relief, people use less morphine when they are controlling it themselves.
