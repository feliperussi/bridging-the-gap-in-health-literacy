Anti‐D administration after childbirth for preventing Rhesus alloimmunisation
Immunisation of Rhesus negative women with anti‐D after the birth of a Rhesus positive infant reduces the chances of developing Rhesus antibodies. 
Mothers and babies may have incompatible blood characteristics (such as Rhesus positive babies and Rhesus negative mothers). After the birth of a Rhesus positive infant, Rhesus negative women are given an injection of anti‐D, which aims to prevent the women forming antibodies that would attack the red cells of a Rhesus positive baby in a future pregnancy. Such antibodies may make the baby anaemic and if severe enough can cause the baby to die. This review of six trials, involving over 10,000 women, found that anti‐D given to Rhesus negative women within 72 hours of giving birth to a Rhesus positive infant decreased the likelihood of the women developing Rhesus antibodies within six months of the birth and in their next pregnancy.
