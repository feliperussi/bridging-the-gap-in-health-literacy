Oral rinses, mouthwashes and sprays for improving outcomes following tonsillectomy
Tonsillectomy is one of the most common operations performed in adults and children. Pain and bleeding following the operation are common. Postoperative tonsillectomy medication should aim to minimise some of these symptoms. A number of mouthwashes and topical sprays are available which offer pain relief or can help to reduce bleeding in the period just after surgery. 
This review included seven studies involving 593 participants (397 children and 196 adults) and is up to date as of July 2013. The risk of bias was high in most of the included trials. We found that lidocaine spray appeared to be more effective than a placebo saline spray at reducing the severity of pain until the third postoperative day. A small number of participants experienced a burning or stinging sensation when they used another spray containing benzydamine but this was not sufficient to discontinue its usage. 
Further research should aim to provide reliable evidence for people to make informed decisions as to whether these treatments can be effective in reducing the most common symptoms and complications following tonsillectomy.
