Different implants used to fix certain types of hip fractures
Many different types of implants are used to fix fractures of the hip, which are close to the hip joint (intracapsular fractures). Implants are used to stabilise the bone during healing thereby reducing the chance of the bones slipping out of line. They consist of either screws or pins and may have an additional side plate attached, which is fixed to the bone. 
This review of randomised controlled trials included 30 studies involving more than 6000 participants. Most of the trials were poorly reported and had flaws in their methods that could have affected their results. Few trials tested the same comparison. Most of the results for the 25 separate comparisons, frequently tested within one trial only, failed to show that one implant was better than the other under comparison. There was a consistent finding of one serious complication (avascular necrosis) with the sliding hip screw in comparison with five different types of cancellous screws. However, this was not reflected in a decrease in re‚Äêoperations for this group. Additionally, the sliding hip screw was found to take longer to insert and to have an increased operative blood loss compared with multiple screws or pins. 
This review found no evidence from trials undertaken so far that there were any major differences between different implants in patient survival or complications related to the operation.
