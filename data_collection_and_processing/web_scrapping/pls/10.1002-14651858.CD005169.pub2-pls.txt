Omega‐3 fatty acids for bipolar disorder
This systematic review investigated the efficacy of omega‐3 fatty acids for bipolar disorder. Five randomised controlled trials met inclusion criteria for the review. Only one trial provided data that could be analysed, investigating ethyl‐EPA as an adjunctive treatment in a mixed outpatient population. Some positive benefits were found for depressive symptoms but not for mania, and no adverse events were reported. There is currently insufficient evidence on which to base any clear recommendations concerning omega‐3 fatty acids for bipolar disorder. However, given the general health benefits and safety of omega‐3, the preliminary evidence from this review provides a strong case for well‐powered, high‐quality trials in specific index populations.
