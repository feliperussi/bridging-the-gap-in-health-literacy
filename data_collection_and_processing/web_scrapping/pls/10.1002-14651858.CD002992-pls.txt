Cardioselective beta‐blockers for reversible airway disease
Beta‐blockers reduce mortality in patients with hypertension, heart failure and coronary arterial disease. Traditionally they have not been given to patients with reversible airway disease (asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with a reversible obstructive component), for fear of adverse respiratory effects. This review of randomized controlled trials, which evaluated cardioselective beta‐blocker use in patients with reversible airway disease, demonstrated no increase in adverse respiratory effects. From the available evidence, it appears to be safe to prescribe these drugs to people with reversible airways disease.
