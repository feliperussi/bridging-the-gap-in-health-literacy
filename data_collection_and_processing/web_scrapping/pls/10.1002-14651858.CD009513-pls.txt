Interventions to improve adherence to ART in children and adolescents
Achieving and maintaining high levels of medication adherence are required to realise the full benefits of antiretroviral therapy (ART). We identified four studies that evaluated interventions designed to improve adherence to ART among children and adolescents age 18 years and younger. These studies showed that home‐based nursing, peer support for adolescents and LPV/r‐containing regimens have the potential to improve ART adherence, but more evidence is needed. Medication diaries do not appear to have an effect on adherence. There is a need for well‐designed evaluations of interventions to improve paediatric adherence to ART.
