Early (less than 30 days after the start of chemotherapy) or late (more than 30 days after the start of chemotherapy) chest radiotherapy for patients suffering from limited small cell lung cancer 
Between 7% and 8% of lung cancers are of the type known as limited‚Äêstage small cell tumours. People with this type of cancer have a limited chance of being cured with chemotherapy and radiotherapy. It is not known when the optimum time to give chest radiotherapy is in relation to administering chemotherapy treatment. This review indicates that it is unclear whether administering chest radiotherapy within 30 days of beginning chemotherapy or later improves survival. The effect on patients' overall survival is not statistically different, although there is a possibility that the effect is in favour of early chest radiotherapy. The interpretation of the current data is difficult and further research is needed.
