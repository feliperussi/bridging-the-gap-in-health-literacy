Biopsy versus resection for high‐grade glioma
Malignant gliomas are aggressive tumours of the nervous system. Resection (surgery to remove the tumour) may relieve symptoms, but it is uncertain whether it extends survival. Biopsy can confirm diagnosis and carries fewer risks, but it will not extend survival or improve symptoms. Which procedure is the best management option is controversial. We found one small trial looking at this issue, but it proved inadequate and of low quality, and therefore could not answer the question conclusively. Larger, well‐designed trials are required in the future.
