Can pressure ulcers be prevented by using different support surfaces?
Pressure ulcers (also called bed sores, pressure sores and pressure injuries) are ulcers on the skin caused by pressure or rubbing at the weight‐bearing, bony points of immobilised people (such as hips, heels and elbows). Different support surfaces (e.g. beds, mattresses, mattress overlays and cushions) aim to relieve pressure, and are used to cushion vulnerable parts of the body and distribute the surface pressure more evenly. The review found that people lying on ordinary foam mattresses are more likely to get pressure ulcers than those lying on a higher‐specification foam mattress. In addition the review also found that people who used sheepskin overlays on their mattress developed fewer pressure ulcers. While alternating‐pressure mattresses may be more cost effective than alternating‐pressure overlays, the evidence base regarding the merits of higher‐specification constant low‐pressure and alternating‐pressure support surfaces for preventing pressure ulcers is unclear. Rigorous research comparing different support surfaces is needed.
