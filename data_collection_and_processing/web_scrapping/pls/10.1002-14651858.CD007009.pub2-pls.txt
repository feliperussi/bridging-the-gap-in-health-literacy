Amfetamine for ADHD in people with intellectual disabilities
Some people with intellectual disability (ID; also known as mental retardation) may also have attention‚Äêdeficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Most of the research into treatment of ADHD with amfetamine has been performed in people who do not have ID. The objective of this review was to assess whether amfetamine is effective in treating ADHD in people who also have an intellectual disability. We found only one study, which examined this question in a small group of participants. This did not find an effect, but we do not think this is enough evidence to draw conclusions about whether or not amfetamine is effective. More research in this area is urgently needed.
