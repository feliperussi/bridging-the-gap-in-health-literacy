Massage for promoting growth and development of premature and low birth‚Äêweight infants
In utero, infants are exposed to physical stimulation. This raises the question whether gentle physical massage helps babies born before 37 weeks gestation or weighing less than 2500 grams (5.5 pounds) to develop after birth, and if it can improve their behaviour. The review only included randomized controlled trials, studies in which a group of babies received massage and was compared with a similar group which did not. The authors searched the medical literature and contacted experts and found 14 studies. In most of these studies babies were rubbed or stroked for about 15 minutes, three or four times a day, usually for five or ten days. Some studies also included "still, gentle touch", in which nurses put their hands on babies but did not rub or stroke them. On average, the studies found that when compared to babies who were not touched, babies receiving massage, but not "still, gentle touch", gained more weight each day (about 5 grams). They spent less time in hospital, had slightly better scores on developmental tests and had slightly fewer postnatal complications, although there were problems with how reliable these findings are. The studies did not show any negative effects of massage. Massage is time consuming for nurses to provide, but parents can perform massage without extensive training.
