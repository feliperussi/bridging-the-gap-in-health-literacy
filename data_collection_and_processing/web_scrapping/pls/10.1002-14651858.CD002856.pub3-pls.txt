Giving women their own case notes to carry during pregnancy
Overall, the quality of the evidence was graded as low to moderate. The updated search identified one cluster‚Äêrandomised trial, which was included. 
Women carrying their own case notes improves their sense of control and the availability of antenatal records, but insufficient evidence of additional effects. 
In some healthcare systems women are given their own case notes to look after and bring to each antenatal visit. This review of four trials, involving 1176 women, suggests that there are both potential benefits (increased availability of antenatal records during hospital attendance, and increased maternal control) and harms (more operative deliveries). All the trials reported that more women in the case notes group would prefer to hold their antenatal records in another pregnancy, but there was not enough evidence to determine the effect of women carrying their own case notes on health behaviours such as smoking and breastfeeding, women's satisfaction, and clinical outcomes.
