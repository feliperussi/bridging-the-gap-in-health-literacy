Barbiturate drugs for people with traumatic brain injury
An injury to the head can lead to the brain swelling from leaking blood or from clotting, or an imbalance in fluid around the brain. As space inside the skull is limited, this can cause dangerous levels of pressure on the brain (raised intracranial pressure âˆ’ ICP). Barbiturates are sedatives that are commonly used to treat ICP. They slow down brain action and this can reduce the production of fluid. 
Data from seven trials involving 341 people with brain injury are included in this review. There is no evidence that barbiturates reduce death, and although they reduce intracranial pressure, one in four people have problems because barbiturates also cause low blood pressure.
