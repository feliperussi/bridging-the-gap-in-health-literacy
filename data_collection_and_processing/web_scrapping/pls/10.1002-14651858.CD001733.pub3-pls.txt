Pentoxifylline for treating venous leg ulcers.
Venous leg ulcers are a common, recurring and disabling condition. The mainstay of treatment is the use of firm compression bandages or stockings to support the veins of the leg. Some leg ulcers take many months or years to heal and treatment is aimed at preventing infection and speeding up healing. Pentoxifylline is a tablet taken to improve blood circulation. The review of trials suggests that pentoxifylline, 400 mg tablet taken three times a day, increases the chance of healing.
