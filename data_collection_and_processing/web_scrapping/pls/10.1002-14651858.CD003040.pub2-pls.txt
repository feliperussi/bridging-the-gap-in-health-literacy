Are angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) an effective treatment for heart failure?
Drugs called angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), such as losartan (brand name: Cozaar), candesartan (Atacand), eprosartan (Teveten), irbesartan (Avapro), telmisartan (Micardis) and valsartan (Diovan) are commonly used to treat heart failure. We asked whether ARBs reduced death, or severe disability as assessed by hospital admission for any reason versus an inert substance (placebo) or another class of drugs called ACE inhibitors, such as ramipril (Altace), captopril (Capoten), enalapril (Vasotec), fosinopril (Monopril), lisinopril (Prinivil, Zestril), and quinapril (Accupril). We also asked whether combining an ARB with an ACE inhibitor is more effective than an ACE inhibitor alone in reducing death, disability, or hospital admission for any reason. The scientific literature was searched to find all trials that had assessed these questions. 
We found 24 trials that randomly assigned participants to take either an ARB or control substance (placebo or ACEI). These trials evaluated ARBs in 25,051 patients with heart failure and followed them for 2 years. ARBs were no better than placebo or ACE inhibitors in reducing the risk of death, disability, or hospital admission for any reason. However, more patients stopped treatment early with ARBs than with placebo due to side effects. Adding an ARB to an ACEI also did not reduce the risk of death, disability, or hospital admission for any reason as compared to ACEI alone, although more patients taking the combination stopped early due to side effects.
