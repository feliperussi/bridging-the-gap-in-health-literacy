The addition of bevacizumab to chemotherapy of metastatic colorectal cancer prolongs both progression‐free survival as well as overall survival in first‐ and second line therapy. 
Angiogenesis refers to the development of new blood vessels from the pre‐existing vascular bed. Tumours are dependent on the formation of new blood vessels for their growth. Agents which inhibit the formation of new blood vessels are commonly referred to as "anti‐angiogenic therapies". They are a new class of molecular designed drugs, among which one (bevacizumab) is already routinely used in clinical practice. Data from 5 randomized trials, which included a total of 3101 patients and evaluated the effect of bevacizumab, are currently available. Furthermore, data from one study, which included a total of 1168 patients and evaluated the effect of valatinib is published. The addition of bevacizumab to chemotherapy prolongs both progression‐free survival from about 7.1 to 9.7 months when used as primary treatment and overall survival from about 17.7 to 20.5 months after prior use of chemotherapy (so called "second‐line therapy") for metastatic colorectal cancer. However, the magnitude of the effect on progression‐free survival is variable and probably depends on the type of chemotherapy to which it is associated. Vatalanib has no significant effect on progression‐free and overall survival. Adverse effects of bevacizumab include increased frequencies of high blood pressure, arterial thromboembolic events and bowel perforations.
