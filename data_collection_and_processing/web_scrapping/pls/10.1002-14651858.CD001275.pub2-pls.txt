The effect of therapeutic ultrasound on pressure ulcers.
Pressure ulcers (also called pressure sores, bed sores or decubitus ulcers) are sores on the body caused by pressure or rubbing. They usually happen to immobile people, on bony parts of their bodies, such as hips, heels and elbows. 
Low levels of ultrasound (not enough to generate heat) are sometimes used to treat pressure ulcers. It is not clear how ultrasound might affect healing, and ultrasound waves may have a positive or negative impact on the blood flow around the sore. The review with three trials involving 146 people found that there is very little evidence from trials on the effects of ultrasound on pressure ulcers.
