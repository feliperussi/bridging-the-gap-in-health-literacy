Traditional birth attendant training for improving health behaviours and pregnancy outcomes 
Traditional birth attendants are important providers of maternity care in developing countries. Many women in those countries give birth at home, assisted by family members or traditional birth attendants (TBAs). TBAs lack formal training and their skills are initially acquired by delivering babies and apprenticeships with other TBAs. Governments and other organisations have conducted training programmes to improve their skills and to link TBAs to health services. There is disagreement about whether these training programmes are effective. This review included six studies involving over 1345 TBAs, more than 32,000 women and approximately 57,000 births and examined the effect of TBA training, or additional training, on TBA behaviour and on pregnancy outcomes. We conclude that while there are a few more studies meeting the inclusion criteria and the results are promising for some outcomes, more evidence is needed to establish the potential of TBA training to improve peri‚Äêneonatal mortality. A lack of contrast in training in the intervention and control clusters and an insufficient number of studies may have contributed to the lack of observed differences in maternal deaths and deaths of their babies (early neonatal deaths).
