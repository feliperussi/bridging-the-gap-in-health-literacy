Organising preventive care in community settings for people with heart disease
Ischaemic heart disease is the term used for conditions caused by a narrowing of the arteries that supply blood to the heart muscle. Patients may have angina, or may have had a previous myocardial infarction (heart attack) or surgery to widen or bypass the affected arteries. "Secondary prevention" is the term used to describe health care that aims to prevent further events or the worsening of such conditions in these patients. 
Research has been done to try to find the best way to organise health care so that people with heart disease benefit most from lifestyle changes and medications that are known to help to reduce the risk of heart disease getting worse. 
This research suggests that careful changes in the way health care and advice are provided may increase the proportion of patients whose total cholesterol levels and blood pressure are within target levels, but the evidence is weak. No evidence was found that suggested similar changes can help to reduce other risk factors or improve the prescribing of medicines that can prevent further disease. The changes that appear to be more effective include regular planned appointments with a clinician, careful monitoring of medications and risk factors (such as blood pressure, cholesterol and lifestyle), and education for patients to raise awareness of the importance of secondary prevention.
