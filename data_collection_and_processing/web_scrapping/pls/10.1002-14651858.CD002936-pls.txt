The use of immunoglobulins (antibodies) for treating people with multiple sclerosis
Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic immune‐mediated disease of the nervous system that affects young and middle‐aged adults and can lead to permanent disability. Immunoglobulins have several effects on the immune system, and help fight infections. The review of trials found there is some evidence that immunoglobulins can reduce the rate of relapses in people who have relapsing remitting MS. There is no evidence that immunoglobulins can reduce the progression of MS.
