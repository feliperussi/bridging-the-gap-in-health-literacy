Silodosin for the treatment of lower urinary tract symptoms in men with benign prostatic hyperplasia 
Review question 
Does silodosin improve bothersome urinary symptoms in men with an enlarged prostate?
Background 
Prostate enlargement is common in men as they get older and may cause difficulties in urination such as a weak stream, having to get up at night and a feeling of not emptying the bladder completely. Silodosin is a newer medication that may help with these symptoms and may cause fewer unwanted drug effects. We did this review to compare silodosin to placebo (dummy drug) and other medications. 
Study characteristics 
We included 19 studies with 4295 men. Participants' average age was 66.5 years. All studies included men aged over 40 years and reported that on average these men had a moderate degree of bothersome urinary symptoms. 
Key results 
Silodosin may improve urinary symptoms compared to placebo. It may have comparable effects on urinary symptoms, quality of life, treatment discontinuation for any reason, and unwanted drug effects compared to other medications. However, silodosin likely increases unwanted sexual side effects compared to placebo and other medications. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of evidence for most outcomes was low. This means that the true effect may be substantially different from what this review shows.
