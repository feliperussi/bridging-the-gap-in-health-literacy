Devices and pressure sources for administration of nasal continuous positive airway pressure (NCPAP) in preterm neonates 
After weaning preterm babies from a ventilator, short binasal prong devices for NCPAP (nasal continuous positive airways pressure) are more effective than single prong devices. Nasal continuous positive airway pressure (NCPAP) is a form of breathing support that is less invasive than mechanical ventilation (where a tube goes down into a baby's lungs). NCPAP usually delivers oxygen to a baby through tubes into the nose, or less commonly, through face masks. It can be used after weaning a baby from ventilation (extubation), or to help babies who need help for lung problems, but do not need ventilation. The review of trials found that short binasal prongs (entering both nostrils) are better than single prong NCPAP for preterm babies. More research is needed on the best pressure delivery system and the best pressure levels to use.
