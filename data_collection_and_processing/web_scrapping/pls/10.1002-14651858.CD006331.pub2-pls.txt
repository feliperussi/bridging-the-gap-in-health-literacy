Interventions for sensory impairment in the upper limb after stroke
Up to 80% of people who have a stroke experience sensory loss in their affected arm. This sensory loss puts the arm at risk for injury and impacts functional use of the arm and the survivors' level of independence during daily activities. We found 13 studies involving 467 participants that tested different treatments for sensory loss. There is limited evidence that these treatments may be effective. No more than one study examined each particular intervention, frequently the studies were of poor quality and lacked sufficient information. Further research is needed before clear recommendations can be made.
