Nurse‐led assessment of fitness for surgery
Before people undergo surgery, they must be examined so the practitioner can confirm that they are fit enough to tolerate the procedure. Traditionally, doctors have performed this assessment after admission to hospital and before surgery, but as many people now have day‐case surgery, fitness is frequently assessed in nurse‐led outpatient clinics. These changes offer many potential benefits, but it is important to examine their impact on outcomes such as cancellation of surgery and perioperative complications. In February 2013, we searched medical databases to look for controlled trials of participants who had undergone surgery and had been randomly assigned to nurse‐ or doctor‐led preoperative assessment (POA). We found two trials, one randomized and one quasi‐randomized. Both studies were conducted in the UK and compared POA performed by the nurse with POA performed by the non‐specialist doctor. One studied 1874 adult participants who were undergoing elective surgery, and the other studied 595 children who were undergoing day surgery. Neither study reported on cancellations of surgery, gain in participant information or knowledge or perioperative complications. Reported outcomes focused on the accuracy of the assessment. As there is currently no evidence from trials concerning the impact of nurse‐led POA on patient outcomes, we are unable to make any recommendations for practice on the basis of this review.
