Estrogen for schizophrenia
The effects of estrogen as sole treatment or adjunctive therapy for those with schizophrenia are unclear. This review found very few relevant trials and data. The majority of results showed no effect and those that did were too weak to draw firm conclusions from. Results from unpublished trials are awaited before recommendations for more research can be made.
