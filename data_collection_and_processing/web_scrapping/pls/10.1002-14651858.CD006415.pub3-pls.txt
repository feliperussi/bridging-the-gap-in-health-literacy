Surgery versus IVF or expectant management for women with tubal infertility
Review question 
Cochrane review authors investigated the effectiveness of fallopian tube surgery compared with in vitro fertilisation (IVF) or expectant management in overcoming infertility caused by tubal disease. 
Background 
Tubal surgery to overcome infertility caused by tubal disease is becoming popular, in part because of risks and costs related to IVF, which offers another option for overcoming tubal infertility. Benefits obtained from tubal surgery would potentially be sustained over multiple cycles and many years, even resulting in multiple livebirths. However, tubal surgery is expensive, as it requires additional specialist training and experience among gynaecologists who perform the procedure, and it can involve adverse effects (including ectopic pregnancies) and operative risks. The effectiveness of tubal surgery in comparison with no treatment (expectant management) or IVF in women with tubal infertility is unknown. 
Study characteristics 
This review identified no suitable trials. Our literature searches are current to October 2016. 
Key results 
No randomised evidence is currently available. Research is needed to obtain information about adverse outcomes and costs.
