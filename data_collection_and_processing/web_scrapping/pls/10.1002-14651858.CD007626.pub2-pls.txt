Monetary incentives for schizophrenia
Money incentivises many. It has been used in experiments to promote various behaviours in people with schizophrenia. We found six trials, but only one compared monetary incentives to no incentives which was the focus of this particular review. This one, very small, study was undertaken in the early 1960s with people who had been in hospital for an average of two decades. It found no clear effect but little can be concluded from this outdated trial except that such studies are possible. We think more studies relevant to current circumstances are desirable.
