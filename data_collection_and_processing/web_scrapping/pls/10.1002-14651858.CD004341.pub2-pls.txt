Positive end‐expiratory pressure for resuscitation of newborn infants at birth
At birth, the lungs of newborn babies are filled with fluid. This fluid must be cleared and replaced with air after birth. While most babies manage by themselves, one in every 20 to 30 newborns receives resuscitation at birth, mostly for absent or ineffective breathing. All babies who are resuscitated receive help to breathe and this is the most important part of neonatal resuscitation. A variety of devices are used to help babies begin their normal breathing. Some of these devices allow the caregivers to give a ‘background pressure’ known as positive end‐expiratory pressure, or PEEP, which may help keep the lungs inflated. Currently, there are only two trials which address this issue. Although there were some benefits associated with using PEEP, there is insufficient information to make this a routine part of practice.
