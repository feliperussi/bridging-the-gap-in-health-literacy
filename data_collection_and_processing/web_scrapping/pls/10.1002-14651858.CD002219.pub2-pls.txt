Ivermectin for river blindness (onchocerciasis)
Onchocerciasis is caused by tiny worms and is transmitted from person to person by a small biting fly. The fly breeds in fast flowing rivers and streams mainly in West Africa. The disease causes severe itching and thickening of the skin and damages structures at the front and back of the eye. It also affects the nerve that connects the eye with the brain. 
Four studies based in west Africa were included in the review; two small studies in Ghana and Liberia and two larger community‐based ones in Nigeria and Sierra‐Leone. In the smaller studies, people with onchocercal infection were given one dose of ivermectin or placebo and followed up for one year. In the larger studies all individuals in selected communities were treated every six or 12 months with ivermectin or placebo, whether or not they were infected, and followed for two to three years. This review found that ivermectin can prevent damage to the front of the eye but its effectiveness in preventing blindness remains uncertain.
