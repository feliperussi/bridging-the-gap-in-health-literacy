Gemcitabine for unresectable, advanced or metastatic bladder cancer
When bladder cancer has spread beyond the bladder and is unresectable or metastatic, the possibility of cure is severely diminished. Treatment at this stage of the disease aims to reduce the disease‐related symptoms and to improve quality of life. Chemotherapy is the main treatment offered to patients with this condition and one drug that has recently shown activity is gemcitabine. This review aimed to determine the effectiveness and toxicity of gemcitabine by looking at the evidence published from randomised clinical trials. Patients receiving gemcitabine combined with cisplatin had a similar overall survival but less toxicity when compared to the well‐established chemotherapeutic treatment of MVAC (methotrexate, vinblastine, doxorubicin, cisplatin). This suggests that gemcitabine plus cisplatin may be considered an alternative chemotherapy schedule to MVAC for advanced bladder cancer but the evidence is limited to one trial only. For patients who have poor kidney function or poor performance status the combination of gemcitabine plus carboplatin may be considered.
