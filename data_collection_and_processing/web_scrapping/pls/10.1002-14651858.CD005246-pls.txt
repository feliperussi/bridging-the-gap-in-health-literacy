Adding chemotherapy before surgery and/or radiotherapy in patients with invasive bladder cancer. 
The standard treatment for invasive bladder cancer is surgery (to remove the bladder and surrounding tissues), and/or radiotherapy (to kill the cancer cells). This review suggests that 50 out of 100 patients will be alive at five years, when they are given chemotherapy using a platinum drug in combination with other drugs, before having surgery and/or radiotherapy. This is compared to 45 out of every 100 patients who were given surgery and/or radiotherapy without chemotherapy. This benefit of platinum‐based combination chemotherapy was seen in all types of patients and encourages its use for the treatment of invasive bladder cancer. However, chemotherapy based on a single platinum drug did not help patients live longer, and is not recommended.
