There is inadequate evidence to evaluate the effect of occupational therapy for people with Parkinson's disease. 
Parkinson's disease is a progressive disabling neurodegenerative disease. Symptoms can include problems with movement such as being stiff, slow, and shaky, and sometimes non‐motor symptoms such as problems with communication, mood, vision, and problem solving abilities. The role of the occupational therapist is to support individuals with Parkinson's disease and to enable them to maintain their usual level of self‐care, work and leisure activities for as long as possible. The review found inadequate evidence from randomised controlled trials to evaluate the effect of occupational therapy for people with Parkinson's disease.
