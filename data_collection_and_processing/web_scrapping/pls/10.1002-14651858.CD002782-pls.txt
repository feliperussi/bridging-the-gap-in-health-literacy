Topical fluoride (toothpastes, mouthrinses, gels or varnishes) for preventing dental caries in children and adolescents 
The use of fluoride toothpastes, mouthrinses, gels or varnishes reduces tooth decay in children and adolescents.  Tooth decay (dental caries) is painful, expensive to treat and can seriously damage teeth. Fluoride is a mineral that prevents tooth decay. The review of trials found that children aged 5 to 16 years who applied fluoride in the form of toothpastes, mouthrinses, gels or varnishes had fewer decayed, missing and filled teeth regardless of whether their drinking water was fluoridated. Supervised use of self applied fluoride increases the benefit. Fluoride varnishes may have a greater effect but more high quality research is needed to be sure of how big a difference these treatments make, and whether they have adverse effects.
