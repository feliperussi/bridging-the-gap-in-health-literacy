Cancer patients with fever and suspected infection can be treated with a single 'new‐generation' beta‐lactam antibiotic 
Cancer chemotherapy or bone marrow transplantation disrupts the immune system, exposing patients to severe infection. The major sign of infection is fever, and the hallmark of damaged immune defences is a decreased white blood cell count. Patients have usually been treated with a combination of two different classes of antibiotics. Evidence shows that treatment with a new single drug (monotherapy), belonging to the beta‐lactam class of antibiotics, is associated with better outcomes. Survival is improved when single‐drug therapy is used, and side effects, mainly damage to the kidneys, are more frequent with combination therapy.
