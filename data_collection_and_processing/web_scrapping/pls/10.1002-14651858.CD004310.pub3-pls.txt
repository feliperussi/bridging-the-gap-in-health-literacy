Megestrol acetate for treatment of anorexia‐cachexia syndrome
Anorexia‐cachexia syndrome (ACS) is a common clinical problem characterised by loss of appetite and weight loss. It is common in patients who suffer from advanced cancer, AIDS and some other conditions. At present, there is no cure for ACS. 
Megestrol acetate (MA) is classified as a female hormone and is taken by mouth. It is currently used to improve appetite and to increase weight in ACS. 
This updated review shows that:
‐ MA improves appetite and has a small effect on weight gain;
‐ MA does not improve quality of life;
‐ side effects are more frequent in patients treated with MA.
This review shows that MA is associated with an increased risk of blood clots (which may result in swelling, pain or redness of one extremity and not the other, sudden difficulty in breathing, severe headache or vision changes), fluid retention (resulting in swelling of the feet or hands) and death. 
In patients who take MA, approximately one in four will have an increase in their appetite, one in 12 will have an increase in their weight and one in 23 will die. 
Limited data are available regarding the safety of using MA, especially in the long term.
