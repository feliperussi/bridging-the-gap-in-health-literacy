Surgical resection versus liver transplantation for hepatocellular carcinoma
The two main treatments for hepatocellular carcinoma are liver transplantation and liver resection. To compare these two methods with each other, we searched literature databases until February 2013 for randomised clinical trials comparing hepatic resection versus liver transplantation as the methods of managing hepatocellular carcinoma. None of the identified studies met our inclusion criteria. There were no randomised clinical trials found that could be included for analysis in this review. No randomised clinical trials could support or refute surgical resection compared with liver transplantation for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma.
