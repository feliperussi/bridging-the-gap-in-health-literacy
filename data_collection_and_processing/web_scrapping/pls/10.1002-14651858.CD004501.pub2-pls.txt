Antibiotic regimens for suspected late onset sepsis in newborn infants
Antibiotics for newborn infants that might have blood infections when more than 48 hours old. Blood infection (sepsis) can make newborn infants seriously ill or even kill them. Sepsis in newborns more than 48 hours old is called late onset neonatal sepsis; it is usually caused by bacteria, and sometimes by fungal infection. Doctors often give antibiotics if they suspect this dangerous condition as it can be difficult to tell if a newborn has late onset neonatal sepsis. Certain antibiotics given for this condition can have serious side effects, including antibiotic resistance, which can result in worse infection. This Cochrane review examined which antibiotics are best for treating late onset neonatal sepsis, in terms of effectiveness and side effects. The authors searched the medical literature and found only one study that met all the criteria the authors were looking for. This study, from 1988, enrolled 28 newborn infants. Some of the newborns received a beta lactam antibiotic by itself while others got the beta lactam plus another antibiotic, an aminoglycoside. There were no significant differences between the two kinds of antibiotic treatment in this study. The Cochrane review authors concluded that there is not enough research to recommend one kind of antibiotic treatment over another for late onset neonatal sepsis. 
This review has been superseded by a new Cochrane Review (Korang 2021).
