Gradual versus abrupt discontinuation of oxygen in preterm or low birth weight infants
Not enough evidence to show the best way to wean premature babies off oxygen supplementation. Babies born either prematurely (before 37 weeks) or with a low birthweight often have breathing problems and need extra oxygen. Appropriate oxygen levels are important as damage to the eyes or lungs can result if levels are too high or too low. The decision to stop giving oxygen gradually or abruptly can also affect the health of the baby. The review of trials found one trial that demonstrated that gradual rather than abrupt weaning from oxygen supplementation reduces the risk of eye damage but could not conclude which is the best method of weaning. More research is needed.
