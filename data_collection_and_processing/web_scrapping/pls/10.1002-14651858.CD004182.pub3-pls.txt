There is insufficient evidence to support or refute D‐penicillamine for patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis 
D‐penicillamine has been considered for patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis due to its copper reducing and immunomodulatory potential. The only identified randomised clinical trial did not demonstrate any beneficial effect of D‐penicillamine on the course, complications, and survival of patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis. In addition, its use was associated with a number of adverse events. Therefore, we cannot recommend the use of D‐penicillamine outside randomised trials.
