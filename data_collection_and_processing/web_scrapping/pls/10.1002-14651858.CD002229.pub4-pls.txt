Hormone therapy for preventing cardiovascular disease in both healthy post‐menopausal women and post‐menopausal women with pre‐existing cardiovascular disease 
Hormone therapy is used for controlling menopausal symptoms. It has also been used for the prevention of cardiovascular disease in post‐menopausal women. The present review assessed the effects of using hormone therapy for six months or more. Nineteen randomised controlled trials (involving 40,410 women) compared oral hormone therapy (oestrogen, with or without progestogen) with placebo. Most participants were from the Unites States (US), and the mean age in most studies was over 60 years. The length of time women were on treatment varied across the trials from 7 months to 10.1 years. The studies were generally well conducted with overall low risk of bias.  Overall, results showed no evidence that hormone therapy provides any protective effects against death from any cause, death specifically from cardiovascular disease, non‐fatal heart attack or angina, either in healthy women or women with pre‐existing heart disease. Rather, in post‐menopausal women hormone therapy increased the risk of stroke and obstruction of a vein by a blood clot (venous thromboembolism). 
We are confident that the results of are review are close to the true effects for most of the outcomes we looked at. The studies were large, well‐designed and the results were generally consistent across the studies.
