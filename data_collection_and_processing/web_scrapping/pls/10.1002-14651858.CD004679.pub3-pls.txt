Antimicrobial agents for preventing peritonitis in peritoneal dialysis patients
What is the Issue? 
People with kidney failure may be treated with peritoneal dialysis where a catheter is permanently inserted into the peritoneum (lining around abdominal contents) through the abdominal wall and sterile fluid is drained in and out a few times each day. The most common serious complication is infection of the peritoneum, which is called peritonitis. This may be caused by bacteria accidentally being transferred from the catheter. 
What did we do? 
We searched the literature up until 4 October 2016 and identified 39 studies randomising 4435 patients undergoing peritoneal dialysis that were evaluated in this review. 
What did we find? 
We found that antibiotics given when a peritoneal dialysis catheter is implanted may reduce the risk of early peritonitis but not of exit‐site/tunnel infection. Antifungal prophylaxis with oral nystatin or fluconazole reduces the risk of fungal peritonitis following an antibiotic course. The available studies are of low quality evidence and consequently, it is uncertain if there is any benefit from using nasal mupirocin or topical disinfectants or other interventions to reduce exit‐site/tunnel infection or peritonitis.
