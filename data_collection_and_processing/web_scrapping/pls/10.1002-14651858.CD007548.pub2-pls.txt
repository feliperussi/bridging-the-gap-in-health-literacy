Single dose oral nabumetone for postoperative pain in adults
Pain is commonly experienced after surgical procedures. Post operative pain is a good model to test whether or not drugs are effective painkillers in participants with moderate or severe pain. In this case we could find no studies that tested oral nabumetone against placebo. It is possible that the studies were conducted, but not reported, because they were used only to register nabumetone with licensing authorities throughout the world. However, this leaves an important gap in our knowledge, and it means that we cannot be confident about using oral nabumetone for acute painful conditions.
