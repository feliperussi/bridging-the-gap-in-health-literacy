Danazol for treating subfertility
The drug danazol (Danocrine) was the most frequently prescribed medication for endometriosis but has also been tested as a treatment for unexplained subfertility. The review of trials found that there is no evidence that low doses of danazol improve live births/ ongoing pregnancy rates. Other negative factors include adverse effects.
