Edaravone for acute intracerebral haemorrhage
Intracerebral haemorrhage (ICH) is a devastating form of stroke. Half of those who suffer ICH die within one month of the event, and those who survive typically have profound loss of brain function and motor skills. Often, they are unable to resume normal activities of daily living (O'Collins 2006). 
ICH occurs when there is bleeding into the brain, typically as a result of a hypertensive episode. It causes cell death by direct tissue destruction, neurotoxicity, inﬂammation, oedema, impairments in blood ﬂow and apoptosis. Animal models demonstrate that oxidative damage plays a role in ICH pathogenesis and might be a target for treatment and also suggest that edaravone might protect cells from oxidative damage. In this review we evaluated 10 randomised controlled trials involving 768 participants to determine whether edaravone decreased the risk of death or dependency from ICH‐mediated brain damage. The evidence from all included studies does not support a recommendation for routine use of edaravone for patients with acute ICH.
