Methotrexate as a steroid sparing agent for asthma in adults
Some people with asthma need to rely on corticosteroid drugs to control their asthma. Corticosteroids reduce the inflammation (swelling) of the airways (passages to the lungs). Long‚Äêterm use has serious adverse effects, so ways to try and cut down on the need for corticosteroids are sometimes tried. Methotrexate may also be able to reduce inflammation, and is sometimes used for arthritis. Its adverse effects include headaches, dizziness, fatigue and altered moods, and stomach, lung and liver complications. The review of trials found methotrexate provides little relief for asthma, and adds its own adverse effects.
