Synthetic surfactant for respiratory distress syndrome in preterm infants
Synthetic surfactant is effective in reducing respiratory distress syndrome in preterm babies. Pulmonary surfactant is a substance that prevents the air sacs of the lungs from collapsing by reducing surface tension. Sometimes it is absent in immature lungs and respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) can develop. Synthetic surfactants have been developed and can be used for babies born prematurely (before 34 weeks) who have RDS. The review of trials found evidence that synthetic surfactant for babies with RDS is effective. Synthetic surfactant reduced the risk of pneumothorax (air in the lung cavity) and death. The only adverse effect is the increased risk of pulmonary hemorrhage (bleeding in the lungs), seen with the use of either synthetic or natural surfactant.
