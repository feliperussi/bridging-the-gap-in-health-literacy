Antenatal education for self‐diagnosis of the onset of active labour at term
Not enough evidence to prove the benefit of a specific set of criteria to self‐diagnose active labour. 
Sometimes it is difficult to tell when active labour has begun. A false diagnosis can mean multiple visits to the hospital, frustration and discomfort for the mother, decreased confidence in caregivers and additional financial burdens. Antenatal education of women has been developed to increase their confidence and decrease their anxiety. Providing a specific set of criteria to women may be an effective way of helping them recognise the onset of active labour. The review of trials found there was not enough evidence to show whether specific criteria are more beneficial than general guidelines in helping women determine their stage of labour.
