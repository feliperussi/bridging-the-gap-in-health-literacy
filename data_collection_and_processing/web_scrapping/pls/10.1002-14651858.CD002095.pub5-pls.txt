Short‐term treatment with medications for heartburn symptoms
Patients with only mild or intermittent heartburn may have adequate relief with lifestyle modifications and with antacids, although other options are available. The two most commonly used drugs for treatment of heartburn are H2‐receptor antagonists (H2RAs) and proton pump inhibitors (PPIs). These drugs act by suppressing the release of acid from the stomach. This review found that in the short term PPIs relieve heartburn better than H2RAs in patients who are treated without specific diagnostic testing. Although the difference is smaller, this is also true for patients with gastro‐oesophageal reflux disease (GORD), who have a normal upper endoscopy . In summary, proton pump inhibitor drugs appear to be more effective than H2‐receptor antagonists for relieving heartburn.
