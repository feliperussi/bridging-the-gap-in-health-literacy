Dopamine versus dobutamine for hypotensive preterm infants
Dopamine improves low blood pressure (hypotension) in preterm babies more effectively than dobutamine in the short‐term, but evidence on safety and long‐term effectiveness is needed. Hypotension may cause brain injury and other serious problems for preterm babies (born before 37 weeks). Treatment aims to maintain blood flow to the brain and other organs, by using fluids or drugs to increase blood pressure. Inotrope drugs, including dopamine and dobutamine, are commonly used to increase blood pressure. However, the safest and most effective drug for treating hypotension in preterm babies has been unclear. The review found that dopamine was more effective than dobutamine for short‐term treatment, but the effects of these drugs on long‐term outcomes is unknown. More trials are needed.
