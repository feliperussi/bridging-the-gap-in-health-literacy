Diuretics effective in lowering blood pressure when given as a second drug
Diuretics are a good first‐line treatment for high blood pressure (BP). Diuretics include loop diuretics and thiazides. We asked how much do diuretics reduce BP when used as the second drug to treat hypertension. We performed a search of the available scientific literature to find all trial evidence to assess this question. Fifty‐six trials were found. Fifty‐three trials involved thiazide diuretics (92% with the drug hydrochlorothiazide) and included a total of 15310 participants. Adding a thiazide to another anti‐hypertensive drug further reduces the BP by an additional 6/3 mmHg when given at the starting dose and reduces BP by 8/4 mmHg at 2 times the starting dose. This is approximately the same effect as when the drugs are used alone. A good estimate of the harms associated with diuretics cannot be estimated in this review because of the lack of reporting and the short duration of the trials.
