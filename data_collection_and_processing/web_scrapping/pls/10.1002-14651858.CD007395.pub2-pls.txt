Interventions for cleaning dentures in adults
Plaque formed on the surfaces of removable dentures can have a significant impact on oral health, as long as it can lead to infection of denture‚Äêsupporting mucosa (stomatitis), gum inflammation (gingivitis) and tooth decay. Denture plaque can be removed by several different methods which include: brushing with paste, soaking in chemicals (e.g. effervescent tablets or bleach) and using special devices (a microwave oven or ultrasonic device). 
This review found weak evidence in support of soaking of dentures in effervescent tablets or enzymatic solutions and that brushing with paste can remove plaque and kill microbes better than inactive treatments. It is, however, unclear which is the most effective and there is a paucity of data on the use of alternative methods. 
Futures studies should aim to provide reliable information about which method is more effective in maintaining oral health of removable denture wearers. The scarce data found was restricted to the cleansing of complete dentures made from an acrylic resin base. Further research should also investigate how removable partial dentures can be cleaned, and in particular on the corrosive effects of cleaners on their metallic components.
