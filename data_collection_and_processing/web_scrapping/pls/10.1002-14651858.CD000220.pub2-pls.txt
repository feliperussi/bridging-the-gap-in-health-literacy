Interventions for trichomoniasis in pregnancy
Metronidazole is effective against a trichomoniasis infection during pregnancy, but may increase the risk of preterm and low birthweight babies. 
Trichomoniasis is a very common sexually transmitted infection. Symptoms include vaginal itching and discharge. It is not clear if pregnant women with trichomoniasis are more likely to give birth preterm, or have other pregnancy complications. The review of two trials, involving 842 women, found that the drug metronidazole is effective against trichomoniasis when taken by women and their partners during pregnancy, but it may harm the baby due to early birth. One of the trials was stopped early because women taking metronidazole were more likely to give birth preterm and have low birthweight babies. Further research into trichomoniasis treatments for pregnant women is needed.
