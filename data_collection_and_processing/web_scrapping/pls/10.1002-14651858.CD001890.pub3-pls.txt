There is limited evidence from three small trials suggesting that the correction of metabolic acidosis trials may have some beneficial effects on both protein and bone metabolism 
In health, protein and amino acids remain in equilibrium however in CKD this balance is disturbed. Metabolic acidosis has been shown to have deleterious effects on protein balance, leading to a negative nitrogen balance, increased protein degradation, increased essential amino acid oxidation, reduced albumin synthesis and a lack of adaption to a low protein diet, and hence is associated with protein energy malnutrition, loss of lean body mass and muscle weakness. Metabolic acidosis is also a factor in the development of renal bone disease, as bone acts as a buffer for excess acid, with loss of mineral resulting from the increase in acid. This review found three small trials in adult haemodialysis patients (n = 117). The evidence for the benefits and risks of correcting metabolic acidosis is very limited with no RCTs in pre‚ÄêESRD patients and none in children. These trials suggest there may be some beneficial effects on both protein and bone metabolism but the trials were underpowered to provide strong evidence.
