Interventions for treating placental abruption
There is no evidence from trials to show the best way to help pregnant women and babies when there is a placental abruption. 
The placenta is attached to the baby by the umbilical cord, and to the inside of the uterus. If the placenta starts separating from the uterus before the baby is born, it is called placental abruption. It can be caused by a medical problem or physical trauma. This quickly becomes life‚Äêthreatening for women and babies, and cannot be repaired. The baby may need to be delivered immediately, by caesarean section if alive, and often vaginally if the baby has died. Additional treatments include pain relief, blood transfusion and monitoring. However, the review found no trials to show which treatments are best.
