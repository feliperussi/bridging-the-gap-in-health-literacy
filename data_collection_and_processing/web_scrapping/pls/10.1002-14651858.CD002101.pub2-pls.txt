Curative surgery for obstruction from primary left colorectal carcinoma: Primary or staged resection? 
No strong evidence about whether removal of bowel obstruction and cancer should be done in one step or as a staged procedure, when people have cancer in the left colon. Colorectal (bowel) cancer is common. It can obstruct the bowel, causing severe dilation of the intestine and the stomach, pain and vomiting. Surgery is used to try to remove the obstruction, as well as the cancer. When the cancer is in the right colon, the obstruction and cancer are usually removed simultaneously. If the cancer is in the left colon or in the rectum, however, it may be better for the patient to have the obstruction and the cancer removed in separate surgical procedures. This review found no evidence in comparative trials indicating which of these techniques is preferable for people with cancer in the left colon. More research is therefore needed.
