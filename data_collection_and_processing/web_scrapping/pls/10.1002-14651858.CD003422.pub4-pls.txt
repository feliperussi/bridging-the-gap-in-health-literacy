Vasodilators and vasoactive substances for idiopathic sudden sensorineural hearing loss 
Idiopathic sudden sensorineural hearing loss (ISSHL) is sudden hearing loss where clinical assessment fails to reveal a cause. Hearing loss may vary from partial to total loss, and is usually accompanied by tinnitus. It has been frequently considered that ISSHL may have a vascular origin (i.e. is related to the blood circulatory system) and vasodilators and rheological substances are widely used as treatments. Vasodilators are drugs which widen blood vessels and thus improve blood flow. Vasoactive/rheological substances increase flow through blood vessels in other ways (such as by altering the viscosity of fluid). We found three trials, involving 189 participants, which showed improvement in hearing thresholds in those treated with vasodilators compared to control groups. However, as the number of patients included in the studies was small, and there were differences in the type, dosage and duration of vasodilator treatment used in each of these studies, the results could not be combined to reach a conclusion. The effectiveness of vasodilators in the treatment of ISSHL could not be proven. Further research is needed.Â
