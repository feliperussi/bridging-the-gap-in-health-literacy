Corticosteroids for cervical ripening and induction of labour
The role of corticosteroids in the induction of labour is uncertain.
Sometimes it is considered beneficial to bring labour on artificially. There are many different methods used and one is to give corticosteroids to ripen the cervix and induce labour. The review included only one small trial and found that there was no evidence of the effectiveness of corticosteroids on either induction of labour or cervical ripening.
