Antiepileptic drugs for treating seizures in adults with brain tumours
Seizures are a common symptom of both primary and secondary brain tumours and can cause significant morbidity. The mainstay of treatment for seizures in adults with brain tumours is medical therapy with antiepileptic drugs. This review appraises the evidence for a range of commonly used antiepileptic drugs for the treatment of seizures in adults with brain tumours. 
There is a lack of good quality evidence to support the choice of any particular antiepileptic drug for the treatment of seizures in adults with brain tumours. Our searches identified one small randomised trial directly comparing two different antiepileptic drugs (phenytoin and levetiracetam) for the treatment of seizures in adults with brain tumours. No significant difference was identified between the effectiveness of these two drugs. This small study was intended as a feasibility study for a larger trial that was not carried out. We also identified one ongoing study of levetiracetam versus pregabalin for the treatment of seizures in adults undergoing chemotherapy, radiotherapy,or both for primary brain tumours although no data from this study were available at the time of preparing this review. We identified a number of other small studies but we excluded them from the review as they were not randomised controlled trials. There is a clear need for larger randomised controlled trials to study the effectiveness of different antiepileptic drugs in the treatment of seizures in adults with brain tumours.
