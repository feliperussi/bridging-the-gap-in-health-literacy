Prostacyclin and analogues for acute ischaemic stroke
Prostacyclin and related drugs, which can dilate brain blood vessels, are of no apparent benefit in the early treatment of strokes caused by blood clots. Most strokes are caused by a blood clot which then reduces blood flow in the affected part of the brain. Without an adequate blood supply, the brain quickly suffers damage which is often permanent. Drugs which can thin blood and improve brain blood flow might reduce damage and improve outcome after stroke. Prostacyclin and related drugs have the ability to thin blood and increase brain blood flow. This systematic review assesses whether this type of drug improves outcome after stroke. The review identified five small trials which, when taken together, did not find any benefit. The limited amount of data mean that there is no evidence at present to suggest that prostacyclin and related drugs should be used in acute stroke.
