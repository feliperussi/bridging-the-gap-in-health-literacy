Clinical symptoms and signs for the diagnosis of Mycoplasma pneumoniae in children and adolescents with community‚Äêacquired pneumonia 
Chest infections are among the commonest reasons why children and young people go to see their doctor or nurse. At the moment, it is difficult for doctors and nurses to tell patients what type of infection they have based on their symptoms and signs. This can result in antibiotics being prescribed or withheld inappropriately. Mycoplasma pneumoniae (M. pneumoniae) is an important bacterial cause of chest infections in children and adolescents. This review assesses the value of clinical symptoms and signs in helping doctors and nurses decide whether a child or young person might have a chest infection caused by M. pneumoniae. We analysed data from seven studies including a total of 1491 children, all of which were conducted in hospital settings. We found that the presence of wheeze makes M. pneumoniae slightly less likely and the presence of crepitations (i.e. crackles heard on listening to the chest) makes M. pneumoniae slightly more likely. However, these clinical features are not sufficiently helpful to guide decisions about prescribing antibiotics for possible M. pneumoniae infections. Based on the results of two studies, the presence of chest pain doubles the likelihood of M. pneumoniae. However, further research in this area is needed, particularly in general practice and outpatient populations.
