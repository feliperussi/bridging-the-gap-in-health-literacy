Antibiotics prior to embryo transfer in ART
In vitro fertilisation (IVF) describes an assisted reproductive technology (ART) during which a woman undergoes ovarian stimulation, surgical retrieval of eggs, fertilisation of eggs outside of the body, and finally the transfer of resulting embryo(s) into the uterus by an embryo transfer (ET) procedure. During an ET, the embryo(s) is passed through the cervix by means of a catheter. Many variables affect the chance of pregnancy after ET, including embryo quality, uterine factors and the embryo transfer technique. High levels of bacteria and other organisms in the upper genital tract have a detrimental effect on pregnancy rate after ET. Administration of antibiotics prior to ET may reduce the growth of these organisms and improve the outcomes of IVF. This review considered the question of whether antibiotics given at any time prior to ET affect pregnancy rates and other important outcomes of IVF. 
In the only study which addressed this question, the use of an amoxycillin and clavulanic acid antibiotic regimen had no effect on clinical pregnancy rate despite demonstrating a reduction in upper genital tract colonisation. The effect on live birth rate is unknown. 
The findings of this review do not support the use of an amoxycillin and clavulanic acid antibiotic regimen prior to ET for the purposes of improving IVF success. The effect of alternative antibiotic regimens on IVF outcomes is unknown and needs further research.
