Stents for preventing pancreatic fistula after pancreaticoduodenectomy
Review question 
Are pancreatic stents useful in preventing pancreatic fistula after pancreaticoduodenectomy?
Background 
There is no accord in studies on whether the use of stents is beneficial and, if so, whether the use of internal or external stents, with or without replacement is preferable. 
Study characteristics 
The use of stents following pancreaticoduodenectomy was studied in 1018 participants from eight randomized controlled trials (RCTs). 
Key results 
We found no evidence that the use of stents leads to lower risk of fistula when compared with no stents. We also found no evidence of a difference between the use of internal and external stents. There was not enough evidence to determine the effects of replacement of pancreatic juice versus no replacement of pancreatic juice. Further RCTs on the use of stents after pancreaticoduodenectomy are needed. 
Quality of the evidence 
All eight included studies were reported as RCTs. The quality of the findings ranged from moderate to low across the different outcomes. The main limiting factor, which was the reason for a decrease in quality in some outcomes, was only one study included in internal stents versus no stents group. It is important to acknowledge the large potential impact if the average effect of one study differs in size or direction.
