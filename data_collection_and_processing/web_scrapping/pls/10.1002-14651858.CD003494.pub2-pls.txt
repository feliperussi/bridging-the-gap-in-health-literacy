Psychosocial interventions delivered by GPs
Many patients visit their general practitioner (GP) because of psychosocial problems. Consequently, GPs could benefit from tools to help these patients. The reviewers found no strong evidence for the effectiveness (or ineffectiveness) of psychosocial interventions by general practitioners. Of the psychosocial interventions reviewed, problem‚Äêsolving treatment for depression seems the most promising tool for GPs, although its effectiveness in daily practice remains to be demonstrated.
