Follow‐up for improving psychological well being for women after a miscarriage
Miscarriage is the premature, or loss of a fetus, up to 23 weeks of pregnancy. Some women suffer from anxiety and depression after miscarriage which may be part of their grief following the loss. Psychological follow‐up might detect those women who are at risk of psychological complications following miscarriage. This review of six studies, involving 1001 women, found that there is insufficient evidence from randomised controlled trials to recommend any method of psychological follow‐up. Timing of the counselling interventions varied from one week following miscarriage up to 11 weeks. In all studies the interventions were delivered by different professional groups including a midwife, psychologists and nurses. Measurements of the outcomes were made from one month to 12 months after miscarriage in the different studies, which highlights the uncertainty surrounding the rate of psychological recovery following miscarriage. The two larger studies included a complex combination of interventions and outcome measures so that any potentially significant effects may have been diluted. 
Further robust research is needed to determine if any recognised psychological follow‐up is effective is hastening psychological recovery following miscarriage.
