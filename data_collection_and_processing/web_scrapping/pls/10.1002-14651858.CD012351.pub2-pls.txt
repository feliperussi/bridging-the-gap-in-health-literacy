Histologic measurement tools for evaluation of disease activity in Crohn’s disease
What is Crohn's disease? 
Crohn’s disease is a life‐long (chronic), inflammatory disease of the gastrointestinal tract characterized by abdominal pain (cramping), rectal bleeding, diarrhoea, weight loss, and tiredness. The disease has a changing course with periods of symptoms (called 'active' disease or relapse) and periods without symptoms (called 'remission'). 
What is a histological scoring index? 
A histological scoring index measures disease activity based on the examination of biopsy specimens from the bowel (small pieces of tissue removed from the bowel) under a microscope. Biopsy specimens are removed from the bowel during colonoscopy (a non‐surgical procedure used to view the digestive tract using a camera) with biopsy forceps (instruments to grasp and remove pieces of tissue). Biopsies are then processed and assessed under microscope by a pathologist (a physician who interprets and diagnoses the changes caused by disease in tissues) who then rates disease activity using the index. 
What did the researchers investigate? 
It is important that histological scoring indices measure what they are supposed to measure (validity); that they detect change after treatment (responsiveness); that the scores are consistently reproducible (reliability); and that they can be easily utilized (feasibility). The researchers investigated whether studies have assessed the validity, responsiveness, reliability and feasibility of histological scoring indices. 
What did the researcher find? 
The researchers found that none of the existing histological scoring indices have been fully validated.
