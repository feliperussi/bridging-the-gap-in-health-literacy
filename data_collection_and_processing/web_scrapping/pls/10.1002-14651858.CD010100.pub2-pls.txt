Auditory‐verbal therapy for promoting spoken language development in children with permanent hearing impairments 
Permanent hearing impairment greatly restricts a child's speech and language development and hinders his or her behavioural, cognitive and social functioning. Although technological devices, such as hearing aids and cochlear implants, enable the child to hear spoken words, they fail to teach the child how to listen, how to process language or how to talk. 
Auditory‐verbal therapy aims to improve the spoken language abilities of a child with hearing impairment to the level of a child with typical hearing by developing his or her listening skills independent of other cues such as speech reading and gestures. It focuses on the context of spoken communication within the family and uses hearing and speech as the primary methods of communication. For this reason, it is thought to be more effective in helping a child reach typical age‐related milestones in speech and language acquisition. 
This review was undertaken to assess evidence on the effectiveness of auditory‐verbal therapy in promoting spoken language development in children with permanent hearing impairments. Whilst many studies have examined the effectiveness of AVT, no studies met the criteria for inclusion in this review. Well‐designed studies are urgently needed to examine the effectiveness of AVT in promoting spoken language development in children.
