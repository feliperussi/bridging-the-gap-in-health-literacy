Antipsychotic medication for challenging behaviour in people with learning disability
The term 'challenging behaviour', in the absence of psychiatric disorder, encompasses a wide range of behaviours that may be harmful to people or property, may be difficult to manage and may limit access to community facilities. Antipsychotic medications have been used to modify such behaviours in people with learning disability, but there is no randomised controlled trial‚Äêbased information that suggests antipsychotic medication is either helpful or harmful for adults with learning disability and challenging behaviour.
