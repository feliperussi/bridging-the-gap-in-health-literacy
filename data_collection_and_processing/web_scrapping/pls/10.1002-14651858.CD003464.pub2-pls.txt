Oral anticoagulation plus an antiplatelet drug is better than anticoagulants alone for reducing death or blood clots after heart valve replacement 
After heart valve replacement oral anticoagulation (a blood thinner) is frequently used to keep blood clots from forming on the valve. These blood clots can block the flow of blood through the valve or break off and cause a stroke. Blood thinners, such as coumadin, reduce the risk of these outcomes and require careful monitoring. Drugs that affect the platelets, such as aspirin, are not effective alone but may add benefit to the blood thinners. This updated review of 13 trials found that oral anticoagulation and antiplatelet drugs were more effective than anticoagulation alone. The addition of antiplatelet drugs to anticoagulants increases the risk of bleeding by about 50%. Low‚Äêdose aspirin (less than 100 mg daily) may be associated with the lowest risk of bleeding. However, in general the quality of the included trials tended to be low, possibly reflecting the era when the majority of the trials were conducted (1970s and 1980s when trial methodology was less advanced).
