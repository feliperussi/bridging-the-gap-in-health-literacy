Using mupirocin ointment to reduce staphylococcus aureus infection rates in people who are nasal carriers of staphylococcus aureus. 
Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) is the main hospital acquired pathogen and although the focus has been on preventing cross‚Äêinfection between patients, it has been shown that a large number of S. aureus infections start from the patient's own flora. Nasal carriage of S. aureus is a risk factor for infection in hospital patients and using a local antibiotic treatment of mupirocin ointment is often used to eradicate nasal S.aureus. It has been found that if people are nasal carriers of S. aureus then using mupirocin ointment reduces the level of S aureus infections.
