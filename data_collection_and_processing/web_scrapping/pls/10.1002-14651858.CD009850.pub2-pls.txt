High‐flow nasal cannula therapy for support of breathing in children
We reviewed evidence on the effectiveness of high‐flow nasal cannula (HFNC) therapy in supporting children's breathing. We found 11 studies in children. 
Background 
HFNC therapy delivers a mixture of air and oxygen via tubing that sits just inside the nostrils. For children hospitalized with breathing difficulties caused by conditions such as pneumonia or trauma or after surgery, HFNC therapy may help to support their breathing. This may reduce the need for other forms of breathing support such as life support. HFNC therapy can be used within the hospital ward setting, the emergency department or the intensive care unit. This Cochrane review is important because it assesses available evidence on the safety and effectiveness of HFNC compared with other forms of respiratory support, to help inform clinicians caring for children with breathing difficulties. 
Search date 
We searched medical databases from the 1950s until April 2013.
Study characteristics 
We included studies on children from four weeks to 16 years of age. We searched for randomized controlled trials; however we excluded studies involving infants with bronchiolitis (a respiratory illness affecting infants that typically mimics a common cold) because children with this condition are included in another Cochrane review. 
Results 
We found 11 studies involving children; however none matched our criteria.
Conclusion 
It is important that good‐quality studies are completed to identify indications as to the use and effectiveness of HFNC therapy in supporting the breathing of ill children.
