Hydrogel dressings to promote diabetic foot ulcer healing
Diabetes, a condition which leads to high blood glucose concentrations, is a common condition with around 2.8 million people affected in the UK (approximately 3% of the population). Dressings are a widely used treatment when caring for foot ulcers in people with diabetes. There are many types of dressings that can be used, which also vary considerably in cost. This review (five studies involving a total of 446 people) suggests that hydrogel dressings may be more effective than basic wound contact dressings in healing foot ulcers in people with diabetes although the original research may be biased. There is insufficient research comparing hydrogel with advanced dressing types to allow conclusions to be drawn regarding relative effectiveness in terms of ulcer healing.
