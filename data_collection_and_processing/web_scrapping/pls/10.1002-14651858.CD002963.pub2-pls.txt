Fetal vibroacoustic stimulation for facilitation of tests of the wellbeing of the unborn baby 
Acoustic stimulation of unborn babies may make tests on their wellbeing more effective.
Tests on unborn babies such as ultrasound, measuring the number of movements and the heart rate are carried out to check the baby’s wellbeing. As a baby's sleep periods can alter these results by making it non‐reactive, various methods are used to wake the baby so that it can respond to the stimulus. Fetal vibroacoustic stimulation uses a hand‐held electronic device placed just above the pregnant woman's abdomen. Brief sounds are sent through the mother’s abdomen to her baby. The vibroacoustic stimulation gives the opportunity to assess how the baby responds. Exposure of the baby to the vibroacoustic stimulation is generally considered safe but it can cause vigorous fetal movements and fetal distress.  
This review of 12 randomised controlled trials involving 6822 mothers found that vibroacoustic stimulation improved the effectiveness of the baby's heart rate testing. However, the data on fetal distress and perinatal death were too few to draw any conclusions on safety. More research is needed to determine the optimal intensity, frequency, duration and position of the vibroacoustic stimulation and to evaluate the safety and perinatal outcomes when used with cardiotocography and other tests of fetal wellbeing.
