Surgical treatment for forearm fractures in children (fractures involving the shafts of the radius and ulna) 
Fractures of the shafts of the forearm bones in children are common injuries and occur after a fall on an outstretched hand. There are two bones in the forearm: the radius and the ulna. After a fall either one or both bones may fracture. 
The shape of forearm bones are important for the twisting motion of the hand, such as in receiving change from a shop keeper with an open palm (supination) or turning a key in a door (turning the palm facing down ‚Äê pronation). Treatment of the forearm fracture aims to restore the shape of the bones such that supination and pronation ability is restored. 
The first stage of treatment involves manipulating (setting) the bones to the correct shape. This is usually done under anaesthesia. The second stage involves stabilising the fractured bones either with a plaster cast (conservative treatment) or metal implants (surgical treatment). 
This review aimed to examine the evidence from randomised controlled trials comparing conservative versus surgical methods and trials comparing different surgical methods for treatment of these fractures. We hoped to find which are the best methods in terms of function and complications. In spite of a thorough search we found no evidence from properly conducted studies to help inform decisions on treatment of these fractures.
