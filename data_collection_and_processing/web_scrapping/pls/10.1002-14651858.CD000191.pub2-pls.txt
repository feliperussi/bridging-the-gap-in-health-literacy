Does silver acetate help people stop smoking
Silver acetate products (gum, lozenge, and spray) produce an unpleasant metallic taste when combined with cigarettes, so they are used as a form of aversion therapy for smoking. However, the review of trials found little evidence to show that silver acetate helps smokers quit. Any beneficial effect of silver acetate is likely to be very small, and less than the effect already proven for nicotine replacement therapy.
