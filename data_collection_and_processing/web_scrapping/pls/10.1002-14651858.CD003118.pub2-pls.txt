There is insufficient evidence from randomised controlled trials to assess efficacy of surgical and non‐surgical interventions for Morton's neuroma. More research is needed. 
Morton's neuroma is a common, painful condition affecting the web spaces of the toes. Limited evidence from one randomised controlled trial indicated that surgery involving cutting the relevant nerve and implanting it into a muscle tendon may yield better long‐term results than standard surgical removal of the nerve. There is little evidence from randomised controlled trials to support the use of insoles. There were no randomised controlled trials reporting the effect of corticosteroid injections. Adverse events following surgery were common. Well‐designed trials are needed to guide clinical practice.
