Pharmacological treatment for psychotic depression
Psychotic depression is a severe depression with psychotic features (i.e. delusions and/or hallucinations). Uncertainty surrounds the most effective drug treatment for psychotic depression: an antidepressant alone, an antipsychotic alone, or the combination of an antidepressant plus an antipsychotic. 
The aim of this review is to compare the efficacy of the various forms of drug treatment that have been used to treat psychotic depression. We did this by analysing all randomised controlled trials (RCTs). Twelve RCTs met our inclusion criteria. These trials involved a total of 929 people. 
From these trials, we found evidence that the combination of an antidepressant plus an antipsychotic provides more effective treatment for psychotic depression than either treatment alone. However, our confidence in this conclusion is limited because the information came from only a small number of RCTs, which included small numbers of people. In addition, the types of people involved varied between RCTs, and these trials differed in design, which means that we cannot confidently generalise their findings.
