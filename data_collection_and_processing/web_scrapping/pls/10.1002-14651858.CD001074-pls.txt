Servo‐control for maintaining abdominal skin temperature at 36C in low birth weight infants 
Low birth weight babies have a higher chance or survival if they are kept warm. The right conditions can be made by placing the baby in an incubator. The air can be heated to a desired temperature, or radiant heat lamps inside the incubator can adjust to the baby’s body temperature (servo‐control). The review of trials found that keeping a baby’s skin temperature at 36C degrees by servo‐control reduces the newborn death rate in low birth weight babies rather than setting a constant incubator temperature of 31.8C. More research is needed.
