Occupational therapy as supportive treatment for people with multiple sclerosis
Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic disease of the nervous system which affects young and middle‚Äêaged adults. MS causes disruption of the ability of nerves to conduct electrical impulses, leading to symptoms such as muscle weakness, fatigue and loss of control over the limbs. Occupational therapy (OT) is used to try to help people with MS participate in the physical and social activities of their daily lives. The review found that there is currently no reliable evidence that OT improves outcomes for people with MS, although there was some suggestion that fatigue might be improved.
