Comparison of two forms of local anaesthesia for cataract surgery
Cataracts are the commonest cause of blindness, worldwide. A cataract is the clouding of the lens that causes loss of transparency of the eye. It is treated by removing the lens and replacing it with an artificial lens. Cataract surgery is usually performed under local anaesthetic, either peribulbar or retrobulbar anaesthesia. There is debate over whether the peribulbar approach provides more effective and safer anaesthesia for cataract surgery than retrobulbar block. Peribulbar anaesthesia is performed by injecting the anaesthetic drug in the orbit around the equator of the eye ball (globe). Retrobulbar anaesthesia is performed by injecting the anaesthetic drug in the orbit further back behind the eye ball, which is near the nerves that control eye movement and sensation. 
We set out to compare the two forms of local anaesthesia for cataract surgery. Our review showed that pain control and paralysis of the eye muscles to paralyse movement of the eye ball (akinesia) and allow surgery are no different for the two types of anaesthesia. The need for additional injections of local anaesthetic was higher with peribulbar anaesthesia (four trials). Only one case of bleeding behind the eye occurred and this was with retrobulbar anaesthesia (in one trial). The acceptability of the two methods to patients were similar in the two studies that reported on this outcome. None of the trials reported any life‚Äêthreatening complications. There was a moderate risk of bias in the included trials.
