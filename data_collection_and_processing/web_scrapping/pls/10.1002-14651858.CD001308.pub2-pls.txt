Bladder training for urinary incontinence in adults
Urinary incontinence is the inability to control the leakage of urine and is a common and distressing problem. Urge incontinence is leakage of urine when a person is unable to control the strong desire to pass urine (void). Stress incontinence is the leakage of urine when a person coughs or undertakes physical exertion. Bladder training encourages people to extend the time between voiding so that continence might be regained. This can take months to achieve but may help people who are physically and mentally able to use this method. The review of trials did not find enough rigorous evidence and concluded that more research is needed. The limited evidence available suggests that bladder training may be helpful in treating urinary incontinence but this is not definite.
