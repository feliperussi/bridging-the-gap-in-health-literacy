Bromocriptine/levodopa combined versus levodopa alone for early Parkinson's disease
Parkinson's disease is a disabling condition characterised by slowness of movement, trembling (tremors) and stiffness. Currently, the best treatment is levodopa. However, according to the number of levodopa treatment years, new disabling fluctuations of movement occur. To overcome this problem, bromocriptine has been tried in combination with levodopa. This review of relevant published trials found no evidence that early use of combined bromocriptine/levodopa prevents or delays such fluctuations of movement in patients with Parkinson's disease.
