Gene therapy for sickle cell disease
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the effect and safety of gene therapy on survival and on preventing symptoms and complications associated with sickle cell disease. 
Background 
Sickle cell disease results when a child inherits faulty genes for producing haemoglobin from both parents. It is a disease that is linked with frequent illness from early life and often results in death earlier than in the general population. Gene therapy replaces these faulty genes with normal ones. 
Search date 
The evidence is current to: 21 September 2020.
Key results 
We looked for trials that used this approach of replacing faulty genes for producing haemoglobin with normal ones in the treatment of sickle cell disease. We found no trials to provide reliable evidence about the risks or benefits of gene therapy for this condition. There is a need for trials that assess the benefits or risks of gene therapy for sickle cell disease.
