How well do Cesarian or vaginal delivery of babies prevent anal incontinence?
Cesarean delivery (CD) is an ancient method of delivering a baby when there appears to be a risk to vaginal delivery; in most cases, a risk to the infant. However in modern times risk to the mother has also been considered in choosing this method of delivery, and increasingly the risk being considered is post partum pelvic floor dysfunction, which includes incontinence of flatus or faeces, together known as anal incontinence. In this systematic review of non‚Äêrandomised studies, no benefit could be demonstrated for CD over vaginal delivery (VD) in the prevention of anal incontinence. This review encompasses 21 published studies, involving 31,698 women, delivered by 6,028 CD and by 25,170 VD. No randomised studies comparing CD to VD in average risk pregnancies exist. The above conclusion is therefore based upon less than optimal evidence.
