No assured evidence on traditional Chinese medicine herbs (TCMHs) stopping bleeding from haemorrhoids but limited evidence on TCMHs alleviating some symptoms caused by haemorrhoids. 
Haemorrhoids, one of the common perianal diseases, may easily lead to haematochezia, perianal inflammation, perianal venous prolapse or incarceration once it progresses to a serious stage. Besides surgical operation or minimally invasive treatment, a variety of Traditional Chinese Medicine herbs (TCMHs) have been used for treating bleeding haemorrhoids in many patients in China. TCMHs might be effective for this illness and provide an alternative therapeutic measure. However, our primary research for this review showed that there was no strong evidence concerning the effectiveness of TCMHs in stopping bleeding from haemorrhoids. The included studies were few and of low quality. Limited, weak evidence showed that some formulae, when including Radix Sanguisorbae, Radix Rehmanniae, Fructus Sophorae, etc., may alleviate some symptoms caused by haemorrhoids. These symptoms include hematochezia and congestive haemorrhoidal cushions, in the short term. Additional, standardised trials are needed for meta‚Äêanalysis to draw a final conclusion.
