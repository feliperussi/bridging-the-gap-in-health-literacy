Medical treatments for throat cancer (oropharyngeal cancer) that is associated with human papillomavirus (HPV) infection 
Recent studies suggest a connection between a virus (human papillomavirus) and throat cancer (oropharyngeal cancer) in some patients. This review has been conducted to assess potential new treatments that have emerged as a result of this information. 
When diagnosed, throat cancers can be at an advanced stage and radiotherapy (which uses beams of radiation to kill cancer cells) or chemotherapy (drugs which kill cancer cells) are the most frequently used treatments. Both have side effects and may result in a decreased ability to talk, eat or drink. Newer therapies (biological) are now emerging that will help the immune system to fight cancer. 
So far, high‚Äêquality evidence to assess these new treatment protocols is lacking, but may be available after 2014 as several ongoing studies are completed. Important outcomes to measure will be the likelihood of survival from the various treatments, as well as side effects and quality of life in the longer term. This review will be updated to include this new evidence as it becomes available. 
This review is currently up to date to June 2013.
