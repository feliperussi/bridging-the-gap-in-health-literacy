Not enough evidence to give a second round of chemotherapy to patients with lung cancer in a poor state 
Patients with lung cancer and a good physical condition who have not been cured by a first round of chemotherapy often receive a second round of chemotherapy (second‚Äêline). A second round of chemotherapy may not increase the survival chances of these patients and may make them feel worse because of bad side effects. This review has found only one study that compared the effects of a second round of chemotherapy with treatment showing no benefits for the patients, apart from keeping them comfortable. This study does not provide enough evidence to judge whether such treatment causes more benefits than harms and further larger studies are needed before firm conclusions can be drawn.
