No apparent differences in quality of life are found in rectal cancer patients with a permanent stoma when compared to non‐stoma patients. 
For patients diagnosed with rectal cancer, surgery is the definite treatment. The surgical outcome is either restored bowel continuity, or the formation of a stoma. Traditionally the formation of a colostomy has been regarded as an unfavourable outcome, as the quality of life of stoma patients is believed to be inferior compared to that in non‐stoma patients. The included studies in this review do not support this assumption, although firm conclusions cannot be drawn.
