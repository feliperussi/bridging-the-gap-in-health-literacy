Behavioral interventions can reduce unprotected sex among men who have sex with men (MSM). 
Interventions to reduce unprotected sex include individual counseling, social and behavioral support (such as peer education, assertiveness and relationship support, discussing attitudes and beliefs, videos). Small group and community interventions include group counseling or workshops, interventions in community areas, training community leaders, and community‐building empowerment activities. The review found that these behavioral interventions can lead to significant risk reduction in MSM. 
Continued research is needed to identify which behavioral strategies are most effective in reducing transmission, and which intervention components are most effective in influencing those behaviors. More research is also needed on the most effective strategies for non‐white MSM in wealthy countries, as well as for MSM in developing countries.
