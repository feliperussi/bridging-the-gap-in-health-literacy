Antifibrinolytic therapy to reduce haemoptysis
Haemoptysis is the coughing up of blood or of blood‚Äêstained sputum from the lower respiratory tract. It is a common pathology around the world and can be caused by a number of different diseases, including bronchitis, pneumonia, lung cancer, and tuberculosis. 
Antifibrinolytic agents (tranexamic acid, aminocaproic acid, nafamostat and aprotinin) are drugs that act by inhibiting the process that dissolves clots, thereby reducing bleeding. 
We identified two trials up to the 19th September 2016. Both of them evaluated the use of tranexamic acid, one for haemoptysis caused by tuberculosis and the other for haemoptysis from a variety of causes. 
Tranexamic acid significantly reduced the bleeding time, but it did not make any difference to the number of patients who were still suffering from haemoptysis when it was evaluated at seven days after the start of treatment. Severe adverse effects were not reported and mild side effects were not different between patients receiving tranexamic acid and those not receiving tranexamic acid. 
There is too little evidence to judge whether any antifibrinolytics should be used to treat haemoptysis.
