Vinpocetine for acute ischaemic stroke
Stroke is a life‐threatening event in which part of the brain does not receive enough oxygen, usually because of a blood clot blocking an artery in the brain. Stroke is the third leading cause of death and is an important cause of long‐term disability. Vinpocetine is a synthetic drug that is based on a herbal vinca alkaloid; it may protect nerves by increasing blood flow in the brain. Randomised placebo‐controlled studies have reported improved cognitive function after vinpocetine administration to people with long‐term brain circulation disorders. Vinpocetine is also used in people with stroke, mostly in East European and Asian countries. This review set out to determine whether giving vinpocetine in the first two weeks after onset of stroke symptoms decreased the number of people who died or became dependent on others for care and activities of daily living. The review authors searched the medical literature but found only two controlled studies including 70 participants. There was no significant difference in the rate of death and dependency at one and three months between the treatment and placebo groups. No adverse effects were reported. This review did not provide any evidence that vinpocetine benefits patients with acute ischaemic stroke.
