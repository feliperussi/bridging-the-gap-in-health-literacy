Hormone therapy for women with endometriosis and surgical menopause
Endometriosis is known to result in variable severity of symptoms. For some women bilateral removal of the ovaries (oophorectomy) with or without an hysterectomy may be required to manage symptoms. This brings women into premature menopause. It is thought that hormone replacement therapy may enhance the recurrence of the disease due to its effect on the remaining endometriotic deposits in the pelvis. Only two small randomised controlled were identified in the literature that looked at this problem. Further research is required to clarify the effect of different hormone replacement therapy types on the recurrence of the disease and the associated pain including during sex.
