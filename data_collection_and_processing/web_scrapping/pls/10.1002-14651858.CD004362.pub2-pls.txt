Haloperidol alone or in combination for the treatment of mania
Fifteen trials met the inclusion criteria and are included in the review. Interpretation of the results was hindered by the small total sample size and by the low quality of reporting of the included trials. There was some evidence that haloperidol was more efficacious than placebo in terms of reduction of manic and psychotic symptom scores, when used both as monotherapy and as add‚Äêon treatment to lithium or valproate. There is no evidence of difference in efficacy between haloperidol and risperidone, olanzapine, valproate, carbamazepine, sultopride and zuclopentixol. There was a statistically significant difference with haloperidol being probably less effective than aripiprazole. No comparative efficacy data with quetiapine, lithium or chlorpromazine were reported. Haloperidol caused more extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) than placebo and more movement disorders and EPS but less weight gain than olanzapine. Haloperidol caused more EPS than valproate but no difference was found between haloperidol and lithium, carbamazepine, sultopride and risperidone in terms of side effects profile.
