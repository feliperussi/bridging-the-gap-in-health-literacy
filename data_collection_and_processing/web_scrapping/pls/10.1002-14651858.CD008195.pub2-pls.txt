Psychosocial interventions for premature ejaculation
Premature ejaculation is a frequent sexual dysfunction. It is characterized by ejaculation that always or nearly always occurs prior to or within about one minute of vaginal penetration. It is also characterized by the inability to delay ejaculation on all or nearly all vaginal penetrations, and its personal consequences are distress, bother, frustration and/or the avoidance of sexual intimacy. Although psychological issues are present in most of patients with PE, as a cause or as a consequence, research on the effects of psychological approaches for PE is not clear. The early success reports (97.8%) of Masters and Johnson have not be replicated. This review assessed the efficacy of psychosocial interventions for PE and found four trials involving 253 PE patients. Overall, there is weak and inconsistent evidence regarding the effectiveness of psychological interventions for the treatment of premature ejaculation.
