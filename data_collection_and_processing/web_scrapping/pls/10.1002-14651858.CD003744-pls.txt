Erythromycin for the prevention of chronic lung disease in intubated preterm infants at risk for, or colonized or infected with Ureaplasma urealyticum 
More evidence needed on using antibiotics to try and prevent chronic lung disease in preterm babies testing positive for U urealyticum. Chronic lung disease (CLD) is a major health risk often faced by preterm babies on ventilation (machine‚Äêassisted breathing). Ureaplasma urealyticum is a common type of infection that may be one of the causes of CLD, although this has not been proven. Erythromycin is an antibiotic used for other infections caused by U urealyticum. When a baby tests positive for U urealyticum, erythromycin has been tried as a preventive measure. The review found that there is not enough evidence from trials to show whether or not testing preterm babies for U urealyticum and using erythromycin can prevent CLD or mortality.
