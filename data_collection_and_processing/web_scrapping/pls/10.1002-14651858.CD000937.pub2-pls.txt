There is not enough high quality evidence to show that dietary magnesium supplementation during pregnancy is beneficial 
Many women, especially those from disadvantaged backgrounds, have intakes of magnesium below recommended levels. Magnesium supplementation during pregnancy may be able to reduce growth restriction of the fetus and pre‐eclampsia (high blood pressure and protein in the urine during pregnancy), and increase birthweight. This review aimed to assess the effects of magnesium supplementation during pregnancy on maternal, neonatal and paediatric outcomes. 
We included 10 randomised trials involving 9090 women and their babies in this review. These trials were of a low to moderate quality overall. No difference in the risk of perinatal mortality (stillbirth and death of babies prior to hospital discharge) was found when we compared the group of babies born to mothers who received magnesium during their pregnancy and the group of babies born to mothers who did not receive magnesium. Magnesium supplementation did not reduce the risk of babies being born small for their gestational age, and did not reduce the risk of pre‐eclampsia for the mothers. 
We found no convincing evidence that magnesium supplementation during pregnancy is beneficial.
