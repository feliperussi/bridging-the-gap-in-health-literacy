Sexual intercourse for cervical ripening and induction of labour
The role of sexual intercourse as a method for induction of labour is uncertain.
Human sperm contains a high amount of prostaglandin, a hormone‚Äêlike substance which ripens the cervix and helps labour to start. Sometimes it is necessary to help start labour and it has been suggested that sexual intercourse may be an effective means. However, there is not enough evidence to show whether sexual intercourse is effective or to show how it compares with other methods. More research is needed.
