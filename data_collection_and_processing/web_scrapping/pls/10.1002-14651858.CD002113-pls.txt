Regular reminding to prompt going to the toilet for the management of urinary incontinence in adults 
Urinary incontinence is very common amongst elderly long‐term residents of nursing homes or hospitals. Prompted voiding is a behavioural therapy used mainly in North American nursing homes. It aims to improve bladder control for people with or without dementia using verbal prompts and positive reinforcement. The review found that although there is suggestive evidence of short‐term benefit from prompted voiding, it is not known if these persist. Prompted voiding is also resource‐intensive for nursing staff. Prompted voiding can take up a lot of carers time and this hinders its wider use. There was no evidence about long‐term effects.
