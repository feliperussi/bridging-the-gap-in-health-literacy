Antiepileptic drugs for the primary and secondary prevention of seizures after intracranial venous thrombosis (ICVT) 
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence around the use of antiepileptic medication to prevent seizures after intracranial venous thrombosis. 
Background 
Intracranial venous thrombosis is caused by blood clots in a vein or venous sinus in the brain. This can result in seizure activity. It remains unclear which people with intracranial venous thrombosis should receive antiepileptic drugs as a preventative treatment. We wanted to clarify the potential benefit balanced with the potential side effects of using antiepileptic medication in this group of people. 
Study characteristics 
No study up to April 2015 met the inclusion criteria for review.
Key results 
There is currently no evidence from randomised controlled trials to support or refute the use of antiepileptic drugs for the prevention of seizures related to intracranial venous thrombosis.
