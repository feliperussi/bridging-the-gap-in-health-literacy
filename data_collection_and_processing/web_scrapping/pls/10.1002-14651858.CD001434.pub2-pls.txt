Creams, lotions and gels (topical treatments) for fungal infections of the skin and nails of the foot 
We found lots of evidence to show fungal skin infections of the skin of the feet (athlete's foot or tinea pedis) are effectively managed by over the counter topical antifungal creams, lotions and gels. The most effective topical agent was terbinafine. Other topical agents such as azoles, ciclopiroxolamine, butenafine, tolnaftate and undecanoate were also effective in curing athlete's foot. 
Evidence for the management of topical treatments for management of dermatophyte infections of the toenails was sparser and the studies are small. There was some evidence that ciclopiroxolamine and butenafine are both effective but they both needed to be applied daily for prolonged periods (at least one year).
