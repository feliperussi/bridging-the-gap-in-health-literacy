Mother and baby outcomes following normal delivery and caesarean (c‐section) delivery in women with bleeding disorders and carriers 
Review question 
We looked at the evidence on mother and baby outcomes following natural vaginal delivery and caesarean (c‐section) section in women with bleeding disorders and carriers. This is an update of a previously published review. 
Background 
We wanted to review the safest way to deliver babies in women with bleeding disorders and carriers and assess problems that may occur during delivery for the mother and baby with either method of delivery. 
Search date 
The evidence is current to: 21 June 2021.
Key results 
We did not find any randomised or quasi‐randomised controlled trials to analyse the safest way (either natural vaginal delivery or c‐section) to deliver babies and problems encountered during delivery to mothers and babies in this population. Given the rarity of the disorders and the challenge of performing trials in pregnancy, it is unlikely that randomised controlled trials will be carried out in the future. Therefore, clinicians will need to make decisions regarding treatment using lower level evidence.
