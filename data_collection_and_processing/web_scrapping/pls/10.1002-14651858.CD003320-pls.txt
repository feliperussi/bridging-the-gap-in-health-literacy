Anaesthesia for treating distal radial fracture in adults
Wrist fractures (breaks) are very common, especially in women with osteoporosis. Bone fragments may need to be put back into place. Anaesthesia is used to prevent pain during treatment and several methods are in common use. General anaesthesia involves a loss of consciousness. Regional anaesthesia involves an injection (either into a vein or into tissue surrounding nerves) to numb the injured arm. Local anaesthesia is an injection directly into the fracture site. Sedation usually involves a drug to allay anxiety and promote sleepiness. The review found there was not enough evidence from randomised trials to decide which is the best method.
