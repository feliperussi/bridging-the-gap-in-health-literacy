While AZT slows down the progression of HIV disease in the short‚Äêterm, the improvement does not last and it does not increase survival 
Zidovudine (AZT) was the first antiretroviral drug used in HIV and AIDS. It is expensive and has several adverse effects including nausea, vomiting, blood problems (anaemia and neutropenia) and myopathy (muscle weakness). The review of trials found that AZT does delay the early progression of HIV disease, but this improvement is not sustained. AZT alone does not increase survival for people without AIDS.
