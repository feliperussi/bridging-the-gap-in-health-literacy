Therapeutic drug monitoring of antiretroviral medications for people with HIV
Monitoring the levels of HIV medications (antiretrovirals) in the blood of patients can reveal if levels are too high or too low. High levels may lead to side effects and low levels may not prevent the virus from multiplying. Prevention of virus replication is important for the immune system to recover and to fight diseases. The results from our review show that there is not enough evidence to recommend that the drug levels should be checked in all patients who use antiretrovirals.
