Carnitine supplementation of parenterally fed neonates
Not enough evidence that carnitine supplements improve weight gain in parenterally fed newborns. Preterm newborns (born before 37 weeks) frequently need extra nutritional supplements parenterally (given other ways than by the mouth). Carnitine is an amino acid found in both breast milk and infant formulas but is not routinely given parenterally. It helps fatty acids to convert into energy and helps in growth. The review of trials found not enough evidence to show any benefit of parenteral carnitine supplements on weight gain or lipid tolerance in preterm newborns. More research is needed.
