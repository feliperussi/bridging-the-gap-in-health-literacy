High frequency oscillatory ventilation versus conventional ventilation for infants with severe pulmonary dysfunction born at or near term 
In babies born at or near term (over 34 weeks gestation) who have severe respiratory failure due to lung disease, there is no evidence from randomized controlled trials to suggest that the use of high frequency oscillatory ventilation is better than conventional mechanical ventilation. 
All infant outcomes were similar in the two treatment groups.
