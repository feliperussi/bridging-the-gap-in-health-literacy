Honey and lozenges for children with non‐specific cough
Symptomatic relief is often sought for children with chronic non‐specific cough (which is defined as a dry, non‐productive cough with no known cause lasting longer than four consecutive weeks).  This review aimed to assess the efficacy of treating children with such coughs using honey or lozenges, as these options are inexpensive.  No randomised controlled trials were found to be applicable to this review, primarily due to the participants in the studies not fulfilling the inclusion criteria.  However, studies on the efficacy of these treatments in treating acute cough in children showed that honey has the potential to be beneficial in children over a year old.  Further research evaluating the efficacy of honey and lozenges in treating chronic non‐specific coughs in children is needed.
