Probable that silver‐containing dressings and creams do not prevent wound infection or promote healing  
Wound dressings and creams containing silver are widely used. It is thought that silver may help wounds to heal faster and prevent infection, but we did not know if this was true. This review identified 26 trials (involving 2066 participants) comparing silver‐containing dressings or creams against dressings or creams that did not contain silver. Twenty of the trials were on burn wounds, while the other trials were on a mixture of wound types. Most studies were small and of poor quality. After examining them all, the authors concluded that there is not enough evidence to support the use of silver‐containing dressings or creams, as generally these treatments did not promote wound healing or prevent wound infections. Some evidence from a number of small, poor‐quality studies suggested that one silver‐containing compound (silver sulphadiazine) has no effect on infection, and actually slows down healing in patients with partial‐thickness burns.
