There is insufficient evidence to support the use of acupuncture for the symptomatic treatment of restless legs syndrome. 
Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a sensorimotor movement disorder characterized by uncomfortable sensations in the legs and an urge to move them. The syndrome is very common and its lifestyle impacts justify a search for more effective and acceptable interventions. 
Acupuncture is an ancient Chinese therapeutic method. It regulates the function of internal organs and rebalances body energies by stimulating certain acupoints. As a non‚Äêpharmacological therapy, it would be of potential value in the treatment of RLS. 
This review investigated the efficacy and adverse effects of acupuncture in treating RLS. The review did not find consistent evidence to determine whether acupuncture is effective and safe in the treatment of RLS, based on the two trials identified. More high quality trials are warranted before the routine use of acupuncture can be recommended for patients suffering from RLS.
