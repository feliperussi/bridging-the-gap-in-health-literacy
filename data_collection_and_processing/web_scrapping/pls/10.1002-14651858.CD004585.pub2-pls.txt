EMG biofeedback for the recovery of motor function after stroke
Electromyographic biofeedback (techniques using visual or sound signals to monitor muscle activity) has an uncertain impact on recovery after stroke. Electromyographic biofeedback (EMG‐BFB) uses electrodes placed on a patient's muscles to generate a feedback signal (in vision or sound) in response to muscle activation. It is believed that this may allow patients to learn a more effective way of using their disabled limb. Amongst the 13 studies identified, there was a small amount of evidence to suggest that EMG‐BFB had a beneficial effect when used with standard physiotherapy techniques. However EMG‐BFB cannot currently be recommended as an effective routine treatment because other studies found no effect, and the positive trials were small.
