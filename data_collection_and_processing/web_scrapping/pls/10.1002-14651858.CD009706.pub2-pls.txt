Flow‐regulated versus differential pressure‐regulated shunt valves for adult patients with normal pressure hydrocephalus 
Normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH) is a condition in which the fluid around the brain is not properly absorbed, adversely affecting brain function. It is often treated using a shunt, which drains the extra fluid from the brain into the peritoneal cavity in the abdomen, where the fluid can be absorbed (a ventriculo‐peritoneal shunt). Currently about 5.5 ventriculo‐peritoneal shunt implantations are performed per 100,000 inhabitants in industrial countries per year, even though evidence supporting shunting as treatment for NPH is poor. Approximately 30% to 40% of implanted shunts fail and have to be revised during the first year. To try to reduce the number of complications, many valve and shunt system designs have been developed. These valves can be classified, according to the mechanical design, into two main groups: differential pressure valves and flow‐regulated valves. No randomised clinical trial so far has compared these two types of valve. Thus, there is no high‐quality evidence indicating that flow‐regulated and differential pressure‐regulated shunt valves differ in efficacy or complication rates.
