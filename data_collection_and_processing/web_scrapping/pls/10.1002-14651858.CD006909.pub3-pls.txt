Interventions for prevention of giant retinal tear in the fellow eye
A giant retinal tear is a full‐thickness retinal break that extends for 90 degrees or more around the circumference of the retina, in the presence of posterior vitreous detachment (when the vitreous comes away from the retina). Giant retinal tears cause visual loss as a result of the associated retinal detachment. They can be difficult to treat due to the large area of retinal involvement and the high risk of re‐detachment following vitreoretinal surgery, often related to the development of proliferative vitreoretinopathy (a scarring process that can happen on the inner or outer surface of the retina and in the vitreous cavity after retinal detachment). As the fellow eye has an increased risk of developing giant retinal tear and retinal detachment, prophylactic 360‐degree treatments with laser photocoagulation, cryotherapy or encircling scleral buckling have been proposed to reduce this risk. This review did not find any strong evidence in the form of prospective randomised controlled trials or case‐control studies to support or refute these prophylactic treatments.
