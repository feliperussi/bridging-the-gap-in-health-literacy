Inhaled non‐steroid anti‐inflammatories (NSAIDs) for children and adults with bronchiectasis
People with bronchiectasis experience chronic inflammation of the lungs. Anti‐inflammatory effects of inhaled non‐steroid anti‐inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) may be beneficial for patients with bronchiectasis. However, short‐term and long‐term benefits in adults and children must be investigated, in addition to potential side effects of NSAIDs used over the long term. 
Results 
We included one small study on 25 people with chronic lung disease. Of those 25, only eight people had bronchiectasis. Other individuals had chronic bronchitis of diffuse panbronchiolitis and were at risk for bronchiectasis. However, we must remember when interpreting the results that not all study participants had bronchiectasis. 
Overall, the small study reported improvement in sputum production and dyspnoea (shortness of breath) in adults with chronic lung disease (chronic bronchitis, bronchiectasis or diffuse panbronchiolitis) who received inhaled indomethacin compared with placebo. Researchers observed no significant improvement in lung function (forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) and vital capacity (VC)) and reported no adverse events. 
Conclusions 
The small scale of this study and collective analysis of data from the three disease states made it difficult for review authors to draw solid conclusions on the benefit of using NSAIDs to treat adults with bronchiectasis. Review authors identified no studies examining the use of NSAIDs in children with bronchiectasis.
