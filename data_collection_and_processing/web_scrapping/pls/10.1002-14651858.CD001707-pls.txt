Surgical approaches for inserting hemiarthroplasty of the hip
Arthroplasty (total hip replacement) involves replacing both the socket in the hip and the thigh side of the joint with an artificial joint. Hemiarthroplasty (partial hip replacement) leaves the socket intact, replacing only the thigh side. This is used for some people with hip fractures. Anterior surgery (from the front) might reduce the risk of dislocation and damaging the sciatic nerve for the leg, while posterior surgery (from the back) may reduce operating time and lower the risk of fracture. However, the review of trials did not find enough evidence to show which type of surgery for hemiarthroplasty is best.
