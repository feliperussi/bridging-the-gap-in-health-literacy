Universal multi‐component alcohol misuse prevention for young people can be effective
We conducted a Cochrane systematic review of 20 randomised controlled trials that examined the effectiveness of universal multi‐component programs for the prevention of alcohol misuse in young people. Multi‐component prevention programs are defined as those prevention efforts that deliver interventions in multiple settings, for example in both school and family settings, typically combining school curricula with a parenting intervention. 
A majority of the studies included in this review reported positive effects of multi‐component programs for the prevention of alcohol misuse in young people, with effects persisting into the medium‐ and longer‐term. But a notable proportion of trials reported no statistically significant effects. In seven studies we were able to assess the impact of single versus multiple components, and only 1 out of the 7 studies clearly showed a benefit of components delivered in more than one setting. 
In conclusion, there is some evidence that multi‐component interventions for alcohol misuse prevention in young people can be effective. However, there is little evidence that interventions with multiple components are more effective than interventions with single components.
