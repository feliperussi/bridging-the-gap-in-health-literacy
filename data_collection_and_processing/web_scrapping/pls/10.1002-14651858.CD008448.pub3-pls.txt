Different stent graft types to repair thoracic aortic aneurysms
Background
An aneurysm is a localised widening of an artery. The thoracic aorta is the largest artery in the body, delivering blood from the heart to the arms and head. If an aneurysm occurs in the thoracic aorta it can expand and may rupture, resulting in death. Open surgery can treat these aneurysms, which involves opening the chest and placing an artificial graft over the widening. A new alternative treatment involves an artificial stent graft, delivered through an arterial blood vessel in the groin, fixed over the widening. This technique is called endovascular repair. There are many different types of stent grafts available. They differ in how they are inserted into/access the blood vessel, how they attach to the walls of the artery and the design and materials they are made from. 
Study characteristics and key results
We searched for evidence directly comparing the different types of stent grafts in aneurysm repair (current until February 2015). This review found no evidence from randomised controlled trials to determine if any specific stent graft performs better than another type of stent graft. More research is required to help surgeons decide which specific type of stent graft to use. 
Quality of the evidence
It was not possible to assess the quality of the evidence in the absence of studies eligible for inclusion in the review.
