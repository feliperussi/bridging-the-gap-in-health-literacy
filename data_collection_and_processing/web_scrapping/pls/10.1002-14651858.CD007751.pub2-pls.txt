Angiotensin‐converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers for adults with early chronic kidney disease who do not have diabetes 
Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a long‐term condition that occurs as a result of the kidneys being damaged. Progressive deterioration of kidney function can lead to end‐stage kidney disease (ESKD). People with ESKD cannot maintain healthy kidney function and need kidney dialysis or transplant. In the early stages of CKD, patients may not have any outward symptoms or signs of illness, and may only be detected following investigations such as urine or blood testing. Two types of drugs ‐ angiotensin‐converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) ‐ have been widely recommended in clinical guidelines for doctors to use in the management of CKD. This review identified four studies (enrolling 2177 people). Three studies compared ACEi to placebo or no treatment and one study compared ACEi to ARB. There is not enough evidence in the published literature at present to determine how effective drugs in the ACEi or ARB families are for treating patients with early (stage 1 to 3) CKD who do not have diabetes.
