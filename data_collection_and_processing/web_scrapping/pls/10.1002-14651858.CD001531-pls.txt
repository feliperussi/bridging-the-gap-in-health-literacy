Pedestrian safety education for children can improve their knowledge and change their road crossing behaviour, but effects on injury are unknown 
A major proportion of the people killed or seriously injured in road traffic crashes are pedestrians, and children are particularly vulnerable. Education programmes try to teach people how to cope with the road environment. Parents are sometimes used as educators. The review of trials (mostly in children) found that pedestrian safety education can improve children's road safety knowledge and their observed road crossing behaviour. Education may need to be repeated at regular intervals, as the effect can decline with time. However, whether these changes to knowledge or behaviour can be linked to a reduction in pedestrian deaths and injuries is unknown.
