Therapeutic ultrasound for postpartum perineal pain and dyspareunia
Too little evidence from trials to show whether women have less pain if they have ultrasound treatment for perineal pain after childbirth. 
A woman's perineum (area between the vagina and anus) may bruise, tear or be artificially cut (episiotomy) during childbirth. This may cause perineal pain or pain during sexual intercourse (dyspareunia), sometimes lasting more than a year. Ultrasound treatment involves using a probe to apply sound waves onto the woman's perineal area. The review of trials found too little evidence to show whether women have less perineal pain or dyspareunia if they have ultrasound treatment for pain. There is some evidence from studies that it may be beneficial, but further research is needed.
