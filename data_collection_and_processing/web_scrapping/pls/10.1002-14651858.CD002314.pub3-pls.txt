Anti‐leukotriene agents compared to inhaled corticosteroids for people with asthma
In an asthma attack, the airways (passages to the lungs) narrow because of muscle spasms (bronchospasm), inflammation (swelling) and mucus secretion phlegm. The airway passage narrowing results in breathing problems, wheezing and coughing. Inhaled corticosteroids are considered the gold standard to reduce the airway inflammation in adults and children with asthma. Anti‐leukotrienes (5‐lipoxygenase inhibitors and leukotriene receptors antagonists) are anti‐inflammatory drugs that may have fewer adverse effects than inhaled corticosteroids. The review suggests that anti‐leukotrienes are safe, but less effective than a low dose of inhaled corticosteroids.
