The effect of aminopyridine for the treatment of several symptoms in people with multiple sclerosis 
Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a disease that affects young and middle‐aged adults, causing different symptoms in individuals. It is caused by damage to the myelin sheaths (fibres that wrap around and protect the nerves and spinal cord). Potassium (a mineral) is important for nerve function, but may become too active when there is not enough myelin. Potassium blocking drugs (4‐aminopyridine AP, and 3,4‐daminopyridine DAP) may be able to improve nerve function in nerves without enough myelin. However, the review of trials found there is not enough evidence about the safety of these drugs or whether benefits are certain.
