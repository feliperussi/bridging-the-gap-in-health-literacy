In vitro fertilisation versus tubal reanastomosis (sterilisation reversal) for subfertility after tubal sterilisation 
Many women choose tubal sterilisation as a way of birth control. Even if a small percentage of women later regret the decision, large numbers of women will seek counselling regarding reversal from their physicians. The review authors searched the literature and were unable to find any trial that met the criteria for this review. There is little likelihood that any future research will be conducted to compare IVF with tubal reanastomosis for subfertility after tubal sterilisation. Therefore this review will not be updated in the future.
