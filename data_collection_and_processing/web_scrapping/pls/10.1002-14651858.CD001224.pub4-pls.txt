The role of voluntary counseling and testing (VCT) in changing risk behaviors related to HIV 
Learning one's HIV status and receiving counseling is an important step to receiving HIV‐related care and treatment, but also an important intervention for potentially changing risk behaviors related to HIV. A systematic review of the literature and a quantitative assessment found that VCT is an effective strategy for reducing some HIV‐related risk behaviors, including decreasing the number of sexual partners of participants. Condom use was also significantly increased among participants who tested HIV‐positive during VCT. Future research is needed to understand how VCT can be delivered more effectively to maximize its potential as an HIV prevention strategy.
