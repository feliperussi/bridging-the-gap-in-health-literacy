Nitrates (medicines) for achalasia (impaired swallowing)
Achalasia is a condition where the lower part of the oesophagus leading to the stomach is unable to relax normally after swallowing. Food may become stuck there rather than going through into the stomach. Although the cause of achalasia is not known, it is well demonstrated that loss of oesophageal neurons is the underlying problem. Patients may experience dysphagia, regurgitation of food, retrosternal pain and so on. Nitrates are drugs that may relax the muscle and they are used to try to relieve the symptoms. They can be taken either as tablets, or absorbed under the tongue. Nitrates can be used in patients with mild symptoms, where it is not necessary to perform an invasive procedure such as surgery or if the patient is not a suitable candidate for surgery for some other reason. Nitrates can also be used if there is no response to injections of botulinum toxin to relax the muscle of the oesophagus. One other widely used option for the treatment of achalasia is dilation of the oesophagus using endoscopic methods. This review found there is not enough evidence from trials to show if nitrates are an effective treatment to relieve achalasia.
