No benefit from immunotherapy with Mycobacterium vaccae in people with tuberculosis
Injections that aim to influence a person's immune system have been used by doctors to lessen the chance of a person developing a disease, or sometimes to reduce the damage the disease does to the body. M. vaccae is a type of bacterium related to the one that causes tuberculosis. Scientists have wondered if injections of this could reduce the damage done to someone when they are infected with tuberculosis, and some early trials suggested this might be true. However, this overview involving eight trials identified that the research does not show any consistent effect of this injection on death or the course of tuberculosis illness. It may be that the early trials had methodological problems that led to false optimism about this intervention.
