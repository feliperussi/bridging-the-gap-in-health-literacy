Adenoidectomy for recurrent or chronic middle ear disease in children
Both acute and chronic middle ear infections (acute otitis media and chronic otitis media with effusion or 'glue ear') are very common in children. Adenoidectomy is a surgical procedure to remove the adenoids and is often performed in these children as it is thought to prevent these problems. 
Our review, which includes 14 studies and 2712 children, shows that adenoidectomy is effective in getting rid of middle ear fluid ('glue') but does not have a significant effect on acute otitis media or the child's hearing.
