Bisphosphonates for osteoporosis in primary biliary cirrhosis
Primary biliary cirrhosis is an autoimmune disease of the liver that primarily affects middle‐aged women and is associated with osteoporosis. Low bone mass is an important cause of morbidity in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis, leading to an increased risk of fractures, pain, and deformity. Osteoporosis in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis can be due to postmenopausal osteoporosis and secondary osteoporosis due to liver disease 
Bisphosphonates, such as etidronate, alendronate, ibandronate, are commonly used drugs for treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis. This review looked at the effect of bisphosphonates for osteoporosis in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis. Six randomised trials, with 200 participants included, provided information for the review. These trials compared etidronate or alendronate with placebo or no intervention; etidronate or alendronate with alendronate or ibandronate; and etidronate with sodium fluoride. 
Having conducted statistical analyses, we found no evidence of effect of any of the aforementioned three bisphosphonates on mortality, fractures, adverse events, quality of life, and bone mineral density in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis. 
In order to have evidence on whether bisphosphonates should be used for treating osteoporosis in primary biliary cirrhosis or not, we need large, multi‐centre randomised clinical trials having high methodological quality, ie, low risk of bias, providing long‐term data on benefits and harms that are relevant to the patients.
