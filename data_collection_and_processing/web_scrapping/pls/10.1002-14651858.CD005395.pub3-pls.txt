Surgery for Ménière's disease
Ménière's disease is characterised by recurrent attacks of three major symptoms: vertigo (rotational dizziness), deafness and tinnitus (ringing of the ears), and/or aural fullness, all of which are discontinuous and variable in intensity. The symptoms of Ménière's disease are thought to be caused by excess pressure in the fluids of the inner ear which leads to sudden attacks of vertigo and hearing loss. A number of surgical procedures, of varying levels of invasiveness, have been developed to reduce the symptoms of Ménière's disease, but it is not clear whether or not these are effective. The surgical interventions can be categorised as two types: one type of surgical intervention aims to affect the natural history of the disease, with conservation of vestibular function. The other type aims to relieve symptoms by abolishing vestibular function. Both types of surgical intervention are considered in this review. Despite an extensive search the review authors only found two randomised controlled trials studying surgical interventions for Ménière's disease. Both of these trials, involving a total of 59 patients, studied endolymphatic sac surgery; one comparing it to placebo surgery and the other to a different type of surgery. Neither trial detected a significant difference between the treatment and control group.
