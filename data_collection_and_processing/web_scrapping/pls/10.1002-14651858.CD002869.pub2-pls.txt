Individual or group antenatal education for childbirth or parenthood, or both
Benefits of antenatal education for childbirth, and the best educational approaches to use, remain unclear. 
Antenatal education aims to help prospective parents prepare for childbirth and parenthood. Prospective parents often look to antenatal education to provide important information on issues such as decision making about and during labour, skills for labour, pain relief, infant and postnatal care, breastfeeding and parenting skills. There are many varied ways of providing this antenatal education and some may be more effective than others. The review found nine trials involving 2284 women. Interventions varied greatly and no consistent outcomes were measured. The review of trials found a lack of high‚Äêquality evidence from trials and so the effects of antenatal education remain largely unknown. Further research is required to ensure that effective ways of helping health professionals support pregnant women and their partners in preparing for birth and parenting are investigated so that the resources used meet the needs of parents and their newborn infants.
