Early emergency department treatment of acute asthma with systemic corticosteroids
In an asthma attack, the airways (passages to the lungs) narrow from muscle spasms and swelling (inflammation). Bronchodilators (reliever inhalers to open up the lungs and airways) can be used for the spasms, and corticosteroids for the swelling. Corticosteroids can be inhaled, or taken by mouth (orally) or through a drip into the veins (intravenously). The review of trials found that systemic (oral or intravenous) corticosteroids reduce the need for people with asthma attacks to stay in hospital, with few adverse effects.
