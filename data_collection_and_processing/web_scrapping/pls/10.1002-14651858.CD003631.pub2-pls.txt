Chinese medicinal herbs for treating acute inflammation of the pancreas
The pancreas is a gland near the stomach that helps digestion by secreting insulin into the blood and digestive enzymes into the small intestine. Acute pancreatitis is a relatively common acute abdominal emergency with no specific therapy. It is potentially fatal. In China, traditional Chinese medicinal herbs have been used for many years to treat acute pancreatitis. This review identified fifteen randomized trials but they were poorly controlled and used different herbs. It appeared that some Chinese medicinal herbs may have positive effects on mortality but there is no strong evidence and adverse effects have not been studied.
