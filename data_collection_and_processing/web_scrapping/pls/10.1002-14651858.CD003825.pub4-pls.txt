Loop diuretics cause modest blood pressure lowering
While more commonly used to reduce water retention, loop diuretics are are also indicated for lowering elevated blood pressure. We asked to what degree this drug class lowers blood pressure, whether individual drugs within the class produce different effects, and what the estimate of harms is associated with this class of drugs. We searched the available scientific literature to find all the trials that had addressed these questions. We found 9 trials studying the blood pressure‐lowering ability of 5 different loop diuretics (furosemide, cicletanine, piretanide, indacrinone and etozolin) in 460 participants. The blood pressure‐lowering effect was modest, with systolic pressure lowered by 8 mmHg and diastolic pressure by 4 mmHg. No loop diuretic drug appears to be any better or worse than others in terms of blood pressure‐lowering ability. Due to lack of reporting and the short duration of included trials, this review could not provide an estimate of the harms associated with loop diuretics.
