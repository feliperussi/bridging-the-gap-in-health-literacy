Pharmacological treatment of depression in people with a primary brain tumour
The issue 
People with brain tumours may experience epilepsy, memory problems, and fatigue. Depression is also common, and doctors might choose to treat this with antidepressants, since antidepressants are thought to be effective in other patients. However, antidepressants could be less effective, or could cause more side effects, in people with a primary brain tumour. 
The aim of the review 
We researched whether any drugs have been proven to be effective, and whether they cause significant side effects when prescribed to treat depression in people with primary brain tumours. 
Main findings 
We searched the medical journal literature to find high‚Äêquality studies comparing the effectiveness of any one drug treatment for depression in people with a brain tumour against another treatment. Despite a thorough search, we could not find any studies and so cannot determine whether any drug is of benefit. 
What are the conclusions? 
We conclude that it is important to research whether drugs can treat depression safely and effectively in people with primary brain tumours. 
Quality of evidence 
No studies were eligible for this review.
