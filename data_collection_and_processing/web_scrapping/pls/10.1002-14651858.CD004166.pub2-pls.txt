Interventions for acute auricular haematoma
Acute auricular haematoma is a condition where a collection of blood forms in the pinna (external ear), often following blunt trauma. If untreated it will result in the 'cauliflower ear' or 'wrestler's ear' deformity. 
We searched for trials in adults or children who had sustained a haematoma. Treatments could be simple aspiration of the haematoma, incision and drainage and any post‐drainage procedures (such as splinting or bandaging) to prevent re‐accumulation of the haematoma. We found no trials of good quality to demonstrate that any one technique to remove the haematoma and prevent its recurrence gives the best cosmetic outcome. The literature, however, generally suggests that treatment is better than leaving a haematoma untreated. Well‐designed studies are required.
