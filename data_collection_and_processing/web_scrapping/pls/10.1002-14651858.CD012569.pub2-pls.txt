How renin inhibitors (RIs) compare with angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors for treating hypertension 
Review question 
We determined how renin inhibitors (RIs) compared with angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors for treating hypertension. 
Background 
Hypertension is a worldwide public‐health challenge associated with high levels of occurrence and risks of circulatory and kidney disease. RIs were introduced into clinical use for hypertension in 2007. ACE inhibitors are widely prescribed for hypertension. However, the comparative effectiveness and safety of RIs and ACE inhibitors is not known. 
Search date 
We searched for evidence up to August 2020.
Study characteristics 
We included randomized, active‐controlled, double‐blinded studies (RCTs) for this review. We include 11 RCTs involving 13,627 participants, with an average age from 51 to 74 years. Length of follow‐up ranged from four weeks to 36 months. 
Key results and certainty of evidence 
Low‐certainty evidence showed no difference between RIs and ACE inhibitors for deaths from any cause, for heart attacks, for serious side effects or for leaving the study because of side effects. Low‐certainty evidence suggested that RIs reduce blood pressure more than ACE inhibitors do, but this could have been due to bias in the design and conduct of the studies. More independent RCTs are needed to assess illnesses and deaths, and to see if the difference in blood pressure‐lowering is real.
