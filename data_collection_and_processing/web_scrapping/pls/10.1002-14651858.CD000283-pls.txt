Chest physiotherapy for preventing morbidity in babies being extubated from mechanical ventilation 
Active chest physiotherapy may not be helpful for all babies being taken off mechanical breathing support. Mechanical ventilation (machine‚Äêassisted breathing) increases a baby's lung secretions. Chest physiotherapy (tapping or vibrating on the chest) is thought to clear the baby's lungs, and is often done when taking the baby off the ventilator (extubation). Although this review found a benefit for physiotherapy in terms of less babies needing to go back on the ventilator, no other benefits were shown. Also, this benefit was mainly due to the results of studies conducted a long time ago before advances such as better humidification systems to moisten the air the baby breaths and the drug surfactant. These advances may have reduced the risk of complications around the time of extubation so these results may not apply to babies in today's neonatal nurseries. This review did not show any evidence of harm for babies receiving a short course of chest physiotherapy following extubation.
