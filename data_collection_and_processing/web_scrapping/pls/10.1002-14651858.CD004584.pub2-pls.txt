Tongxinluo capsule for acute stroke
Traditional Chinese medicine is often used to treat patients with acute ischaemic stroke. The authors undertook a systematic review of the potential benefits and safety of tongxinluo capsule used for the treatment of patients with acute ischaemic stroke. Two relevant studies with a total of 232 participants were identified, but they did not provide reliable evidence about the effects of this treatment. Larger‚Äêscale high quality randomised controlled trials (RCTs) are needed to determine the effects of tongxinluo capsule in patients with stroke.
