Treatments to cure long‐term infections with Burkholderia cepacia in people with cystic fibrosis 
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence for antibiotic treatment to cure early infection with Burkholderia cepacia complex in people with cystic fibrosis and prevent it becoming permanent. 
Background 
Cystic fibrosis is an inherited disease and people who have this disease produce large amounts of thick mucus which is difficult to clear. This mucus blocks up their lungs and digestive systems. People with cystic fibrosis suffer from lots of chest infections, which cause scarring of their airways. Eventually, they develop infections that can't be cured with antibiotics, so their lungs always contain lots of bugs, this is described as being chronically infected. One of these bugs, Burkholderia cepacia, causes a lot of problems for people with cystic fibrosis because it is very difficult to treat and makes their lung disease deteriorate faster than it otherwise would. This is an updated version of the review. 
Search date 
We last searched for any evidence on 12 March 2019.
Study characteristics 
We looked for studies of treatments which could eliminate Burkholderia cepacia from the lungs of people with cystic fibrosis. We did not find any relevant studies. This review highlights an urgent need for more research into new ways of treating long‐term Burkholderia cepacia infection in people with cystic fibrosis.
