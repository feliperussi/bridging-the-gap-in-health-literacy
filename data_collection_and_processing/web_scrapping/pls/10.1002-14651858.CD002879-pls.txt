Beclomethasone at different doses for chronic asthma
Inhaled steroids help control inflammation in the airways of the lung. There are numerous different preparations available, and we have assessed how varying the dose of beclomethasone (BDP) affects asthma in this review. There was a limited amount of evidence that 800mcg/d was superior to 400mcg/d in improving morning and evening peak flow. More research into the effects of different doses of BDP is required.
