Immunotherapy for recurrent miscarriage
Immunotherapy does not lower the risk of future miscarriage in women who repeatedly miscarry. 
Background Recurrent miscarriage is three or more consecutive early miscarriages. One theory is that for some women, this might be caused by an immune system response to the embryo or fetus. Therapies that try to immunize the woman against the 'foreign' cells of a future pregnancy have been tried. Immunotherapies have included white blood cells (leukocytes) from the woman's partner or a donor, products derived from early embryos (trophoblast membranes), or antibodies derived from blood (immunoglobulin). 
Review question We sought to determine whether immunological treatments would improve the chance of live births in women with a history of recurrent miscarriage.  Study characteristics We included 20 randomized controlled trials involving 1137 women, which took place from 1985 and 2004 in 11 countries. The trials examined four different forms of immunotherapy: immunization using white blood cells from the woman's partner (12 trials, 641 women), white blood cells from a third‚Äêparty donor (three trials, 156 women), products derived from early embryos (one trial, 37 women), or antibodies derived from blood (intravenous immunoglobulin) (eight trials 303 women). 
Quality of the evidence and conclusions Overall, we considered the risk of bias for the majority of included studies to be low. 
The review of trials found that none of these treatments provided a significant beneficial effect over placebo in improving the live birth rate or lowered the risk of future miscarriage in women who have recurrent miscarriages.
