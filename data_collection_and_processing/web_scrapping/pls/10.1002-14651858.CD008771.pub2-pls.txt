Early versus late administration of amino acids in preterm infants receiving parenteral nutrition 
Early administration of amino acids results in positive nitrogen balance. Metabolic acidosis, elevated serum ammonia and hypoglycaemia are not a complication of early administration of amino acids. Elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) is consistently associated with early administration of amino acids. We included seven trials in this review. The number of study participants is small and the protocols of the studies included are not identical.
