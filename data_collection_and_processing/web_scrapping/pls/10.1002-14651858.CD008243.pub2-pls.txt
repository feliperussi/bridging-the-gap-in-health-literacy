Intravenous antibiotics can be delivered through a variety of devices
In cystic fibrosis, patients require prolonged courses of intravenous antibiotics. There are several devices which can be used to administer intravenous antibiotics, including peripheral cannulae (which we have termed short intravenous lines) and percutaneous (through the skin) long intravenous lines. A percutaneous long intravenous line is a flexible narrow tube which is inserted with a needle through the skin into a vein and threaded further up the vein than a short intravenous line. We have found two trials comparing these devices and including 67 participants in total. The studies compared different devices, so we could not pool the information from the two studies. However, one study showed that long intravenous lines last for longer than short intravenous lines (thus reducing the number of procedures which a participant has to undergo for a course of antibiotics). Patient satisfaction was higher with long intravenous lines compared to short intravenous lines. The study comparing two different types of long intravenous line did not show that one type was clearly better than another. Neither study was large enough to show differences in complications for the different devices. Neither study reported on important outcomes, such as the number of attempts required to insert the device. We recommend further research to compare different types of percutaneous long intravenous line.
