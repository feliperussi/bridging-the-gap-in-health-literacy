Enteral feeding (tube feeding) in people with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, also known as motor neuron disease 
Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis/motor neuron disease is a progressive neuromuscular disease causing muscle weakness resulting in paralysis. It is usually fatal. At some stage in the disease, most people have difficulty chewing and swallowing (dysphagia). This can cause significant weight loss. At this stage enteral feeding, or the placing of a feeding tube through the abdominal wall into the stomach (also known as percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy), may be recommended to maintain adequate nutrition. This review looked for evidence from randomized clinical trials in which patients who underwent tube feeding were compared with patients not on tube feeding with regards to survival, maintaining adequate nutrition and quality of life and complications of feeding tube placement. No randomized controlled trials were found. Non‚Äêrandomized evidence suggested a benefit from enteral feeding but this needs to be confirmed in a large randomized controlled trial.
