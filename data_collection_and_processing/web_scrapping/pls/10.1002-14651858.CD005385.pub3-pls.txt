Recombinant human activated protein for severe sepsis in neonates
Sepsis (a generalized blood stream infection) is common in neonates. Severe sepsis carries a high mortality and morbidity even with current critical care management. Activated Protein C (APC) is a protein formed within the human body to prevent formation of blood clots and helps in breaking down clots. Recombinant human APC (rhAPC) is a synthesized version of APC using recombinant technology. It has been shown to reduce mortality in severe sepsis in adults. The review authors investigated whether treatment of severe sepsis in newborn infants with rhAPC will help to reduce mortality and severe morbidity. The review authors found no controlled studies in this age group. On October 25, 2011 rhAPC (XigrisÂ®) was withdrawn from the market by Eli Lilly due to side effect in adults. RhAPC should no longer be used in any age category and the product should be returned to the distributor.
