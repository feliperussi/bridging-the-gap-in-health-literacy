Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) for the treatment of obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) 
Transcranial magnetic stimulation was introduced as neurophysiological technique in 1985 when Anthony Barker and his team developed a compact machine that permitted a non‐invasive stimulation of the cerebral cortex. In addition it has been suggested that TMS could have therapeutic potential. Its' capability for excitation or inhibition of cortical areas in a non‐invasive way represents a remarkable advance in neuroscience researches. Some studies have evaluated the therapeutic effects of repetitive TMS in controlled studies on patients with obsessive‐compulsive disorder observing some changes in their behaviour in terms of compulsive urges or improvements in mood. This review has evaluated the current evidence for TMS as a therapeutic treatment for obsessive‐compulsive disorder (OCD). There is a lack of evidence for the effect of TMS in the treatment of OCD.
