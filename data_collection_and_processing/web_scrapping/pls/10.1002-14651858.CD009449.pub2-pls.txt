Hydralazine for pulmonary hypertension in low birth weight infants with chronic lung disease 
In premature infants, pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) associated with chronic lung disease (CLD) is associated with high mortality rate. With the exception of oxygen supplementation, no specific interventions have been established as an effective treatment for PAH in premature infants with CLD. Vasodilators could be effective treatments to reduce pulmonary arterial pressure, but little has been proven regarding their clinical effectiveness and concern remains regarding adverse effects. This review found no trials of the use of hydralazine for low birth weight infant with PAH related to CLD. However, since hydralazine is inexpensive and potentially beneficial, randomised controlled trials are recommended.
