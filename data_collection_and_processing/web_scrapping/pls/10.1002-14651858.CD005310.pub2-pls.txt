Methylxanthines for prolonged non‐specific cough in children
Children with non‐specific cough (dry and non‐productive cough without any other respiratory symptom, sign or systemic illness) are commonly treated with a variety of medications to manage the symptom of cough. This review examined whether there was any evidence for using methylxanthines in children with non‐specific cough. There were no randomised controlled trials that assessed methylxanthines for prolonged non‐specific cough in children. In four non‐randomised controlled studies, the researchers described that dramatic improvements in cough were seen within 2‐14 days of taking oral theophylline. However, this is possibly a placebo and/or time period effect. There is no RCT evidence to support the routine use of methylxanthines for the symptom of non‐specific cough in children. Further research examining the effects of methylxanthines using child appropriate cough outcome measures are needed.
