Antibiotic prophylaxis for elective gallbladder surgery
Elective gallbladder surgery is the most common elective surgical procedure in the abdomen. Antibiotic prophylaxis is a common conduct in open cholecystectomy, and it is also applied to patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy without any proof of effectiveness. Laparoscopic surgery offers some advantages related to less manipulation and shorter length of surgical wound, so antibiotic prophylaxis effect could be lower than in open surgery. This meta‐analysis of eleven randomised clinical trials could not find sufficient evidence to support or refute the use of antibiotic prophylaxis to reduce surgical site infection or global infections in patients with low anaesthetic risk, low co‐morbidities, and low‐risk of conversion to open surgery, and undergoing elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy. This is why large and well‐designed randomised trials including patients with high‐risk of conversion to open surgery should be conducted in order to define the beneficial or harmful effects of the antibiotics when given as a prophylaxis.
