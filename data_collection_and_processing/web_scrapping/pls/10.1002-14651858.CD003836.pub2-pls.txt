Bed rest for acute uncomplicated myocardial infarction
Bed rest is an inherent part of treatment for acute myocardial infarction (AMI). In clinical practice this intervention is prescribed in different ways and for different lengths of time. Current guidelines recommend at least 12 hours bed rest following AMI. However the basis for these recommendations is unclear. This review found 15 trials which were generally outdated and of moderate to poor methodological quality. Bed rest ranging from 2 to 12 days appears to be as safe as longer periods of bed rest. No evidence was found to support the current bed rest recommendations of not more than 12 to 24 hours. The optimal duration of bed rest after AMI remains undetermined from the available evidence.
