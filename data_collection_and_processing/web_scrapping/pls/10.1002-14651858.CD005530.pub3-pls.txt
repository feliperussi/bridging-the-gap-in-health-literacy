Combined DTP‐HBV‐HIB vaccine versus separately administered DTP‐HBV and HIB vaccines in healthy infants up to two years old 
Childhood vaccinations provide an effective method of protection against diseases. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that routine infant immunisation programmes include a vaccination against Haemophilus influenzae (H. influenza) type B (HIB) in the combined diphtheria‐tetanus‐pertussis (DTP)‐hepatitis B virus (HBV) vaccination. We compared the combined DTP‐HBV‐HIB vaccine with the separate DTP‐HBV and HIB vaccines. Studies only reported on immunogenicity and reactogenicity. 
We included 20 studies with 5874 participants in the immunogenicity analysis and 5232 in the reactogenicity analysis. In two immunological responses, the combined vaccine achieved lower responses than the separate vaccines for HIB and tetanus. We did not find any significant differences in immunogenicity for pertussis‐diphtheria‐polio and hepatitis B. Serious adverse events were comparable. Minor adverse events were more common with the combined vaccine. Overall, the level of evidence provided by the studies was low and we could not conclude that the immune responses with the combined vaccine were equivalent to the separate injections.
