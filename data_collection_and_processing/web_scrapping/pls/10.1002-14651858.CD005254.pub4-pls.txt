Surfactant for pulmonary haemorrhage in neonates
Bleeding into the lungs (pulmonary haemorrhage) occurs mainly in infants born before term (37 weeks' gestation) because of severe lung disease (particularly respiratory distress syndrome, a disease caused by the lack of the normal lining chemicals of the lung (surfactant)) and the need for a breathing machine (assisted ventilation). The risk factors for pulmonary haemorrhage include preterm birth, poor growth while in the womb (intrauterine growth restriction), respiratory problems, abnormal blood flow around the blood vessels in the lungs (patent ductus arteriosus), bleeding problems (coagulopathy), the need for a breathing machine and surfactant treatment. The underlining cause of pulmonary haemorrhage is thought to be a rapid increase in pulmonary blood flow due to a patent ductus arteriosus. Some studies have shown promising results with the use of surfactant treatment in infants with pulmonary haemorrhage. However, no randomised controlled trials were identified in this review. Currently, no recommendation for clinical practice based on randomised controlled trials can be presented; further research is needed.
