Not enough evidence to conclude the effect of pentoxifylline on patients with alcoholic hepatitis  
Hepatitis is inflammatory injury of the liver. Alcohol is toxic to the liver, and too much alcohol can cause alcoholic hepatitis. The severe form of alcoholic hepatitis is life‐threatening. The use of pentoxifylline as a treatment for alcoholic hepatitis cannot be supported or rejected based on the best evidence available today. We found five randomised trials, which together included 336 participants; half received pentoxifylline, and the other half received placebo or no intervention. We performed this systematic review and statistical analyses but could not show firm evidence of beneficial effects of pentoxifylline on mortality or on complications of liver diseases in patients with alcoholic hepatitis. Pentoxifylline did appear to cause more serious and non‐serious side effects. In order to help decide whether pentoxifylline should be used to treat alcoholic hepatitis or not, we need well‐designed, well‐conducted, large randomised clinical trials, with short‐term (less than one month) and long‐term (more than one month) data on benefits and harms.
