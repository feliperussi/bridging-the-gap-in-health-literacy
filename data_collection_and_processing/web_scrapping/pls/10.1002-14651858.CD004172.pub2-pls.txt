Does platelet‐rich plasmapheresis (PRP) reduce the need for donor blood
Platelet‐rich plasmapheresis is a technique that involves a patient’s own blood (autologous whole blood) being withdrawn via an intravenous catheter into a device that separates the blood by centrifugation into red blood cells (RBC), plasma, and a highly concentrated platelet solution. This concentrated autologous platelet solution is returned to the patient at the end of the operation to optimise blood clotting and minimise bleeding. The review of trials found that while PRP can reduce post‐operative blood loss and the need for blood transfusion, other techniques may be more effective.
