No evidence of benefit of selegiline for Alzheimer's disease
Despite its initial promise, i.e. the potential neuroprotective properties, and its role in the treatment of Parkinson's disease, selegiline for Alzheimer's disease has proved disappointing. Although there is no evidence of a significant adverse event profile, there is also no evidence of a clinically meaningful benefit for people with Alzheimer's disease. There would seem to be no justification, therefore, to use it for Alzheimer's disease, nor for any further studies of its efficacy in Alzheimer's disease.
