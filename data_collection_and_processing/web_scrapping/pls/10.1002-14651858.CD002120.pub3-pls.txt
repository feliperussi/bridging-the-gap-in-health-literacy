Combined oral contraceptive pill (OCP) as treatment for primary dysmenorrhoea
Dysmenorrhoea is painful menstruation (woman's monthly bleeding) with the symptoms including cramping, headaches, nausea and vomiting. An excess of the hormone prostaglandin is a known cause. The synthetic hormones in combined oral contraceptive pills suppress ovulation, which could result in a reduction in dysmenorrhoea. The OCP reduces the amount of prostaglandin produced by glands in the lining of the uterus; which then reduces both uterine blood flow and cramps. The preparations of OCP with doses less than 35 mcg were effective and should be the preparation of choice.
