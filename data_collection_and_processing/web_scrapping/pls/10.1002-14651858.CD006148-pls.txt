Structured treatment interruptions (STI) in chronic unsuppressed HIV infection in adults 
Structured treatment interruptions (STI) of antiretroviral therapy (ART) have been under investigation as an alternative strategy in the management of chronic HIV infection since 1999. The investigation of treatment interruptions (also called "drug holidays") was initially driven by patients seeking to alleviate treatment fatigue, reduce drug‐related toxicities, and improve quality of life. In patients whose ART treatment fails, treatment interruption has been implemented in order to halt progression of HIV drug resistance on the failing regimen, thereby preserving subsequent treatment options. In patients with multi‐drug resistance, some early studies suggested that ART interruption could improve subsequent response to ART. More recently, STI has been proposed as a means of reducing the cost of HIV treatment in resource‐limited settings.   We conducted a systematic review of evidence regarding STI in persons with chronic, unsuppressed HIV infection and multi‐drug resistance. Based on the completed trials we reviewed, the vast majority of evidence suggests greater harm than benefit from interrupting ART in patients with chronic HIV infection, who have treatment failure with multi‐drug resistant HIV. The evidence does not support the use of STI with such patients.
