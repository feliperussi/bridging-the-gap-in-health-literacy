Gowning by attendants and visitors in newborn nurseries for prevention of neonatal morbidity and mortality 
Newborn nurseries and neonatal intensive care units often require staff and visitors to wear overgowns with the intention of preventing the spread of infection. It has also been thought that putting on an overgown will remind people to wash their hands, which is of proven importance in preventing infection. A review of the medical literature identified eight clinical trials on gowning in these settings, involving 3811 newborns. Infection rates, death rates, or the length of stay of infants were not significantly affected by wearing gowns. Only two of the trials were considered to be of good quality, and there was variation between trials regarding gowning policies. Gowning did not increase the rate of handwashing. There is no evidence to support the use of gowning by staff to prevent the spread of infection. Based on these studies, gowning may not be a cost effective policy.
