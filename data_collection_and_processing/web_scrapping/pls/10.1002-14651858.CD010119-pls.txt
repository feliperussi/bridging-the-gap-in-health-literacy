Integrating HIV/AIDS services with services focused on the health of mothers, infants and children, as well as on nutrition and family planning 
Integrating HIV/AIDS prevention and treatment services with services focused on the health of mothers, infants and children, as well as on nutrition and family planning (MNCHN‐FP) may improve the health of mothers and children affected by HIV/AIDS or a risk of HIV infection. We identified 20 articles representing 19 strategies for integrating these kinds of services. Overall, we found that integrating HIV/AIDS and MNCHN‐FP services was was feasible across a variety of integration models, locations, and populations. Most studies reported that integration had a positive impact on health outcomes. Many studies, however, also reported that some outcomes had improved, while others had not improved; or that there was no effect at all. 
There are still significant gaps in the evidence. There is a need for rigorous research comparing the outcomes of integrated services with those of non‐integrated services. Such studies should look at the impact of integrated programs on cost, cost‐effectiveness, the rate at which new HIV and other sexually transmitted infections occur in the population, and the impact on the rate of serious illness and death in women and children. These rigorous studies will help researchers and doctors to develop effective integrated programs, and will help policy‐makers to develop evidence‐based health policy.
