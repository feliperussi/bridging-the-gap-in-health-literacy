Graduated driver licensing for reducing motor vehicle crashes among young drivers
Young drivers are at high risk of involvement in motor vehicle crashes. Graduated driver licensing (GDL) has been proposed as a means of reducing crash rates among novice drivers by gradually introducing them to higher risk driving situations. This review found 34 studies that have evaluated various types of GDL programs. All of the studies reported positive findings, with reductions for all types of crashes among all teenage drivers. However, the size of the reductions varied and, based on the included studies it is not possible to say which aspects of GDL programs have the biggest effect. Future research on GDL should evaluate the relative impact of different program components.
