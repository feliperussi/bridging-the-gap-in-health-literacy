Endoscopic cyclophotocoagulation for open angle glaucoma and primary angle closure
What was the aim of the review? The aim of this Cochrane Review was to find out if endoscopic cyclophotocoagulation (ECP) lowers the pressure in the eye for people with open angle glaucoma or angle closure. The Cochrane Review authors collected and analysed all relevant studies to answer this question and found no completed studies and one ongoing study. 
Key messages There are no relevant published studies comparing ECP with other treatments. 
What was studied in the review? Glaucoma is a common eye condition and can cause blindness if left untreated. In glaucoma, the optic nerve (which connects the eye to the brain) is damaged, often due to increased pressure in the eye due to build‐up of fluid. ECP is a type of surgery in which doctors use a laser to slow down the production of this fluid. This may lead to lower eye pressure and a lower chance of damage to the optic nerve. ECP may cause less damage to the eye than other types of glaucoma surgery. This could be safer and more comfortable and help recovery.  
What were the main results of the review? The Cochrane Review authors did not find any completed studies that could be included in this review. 
How up‐to‐date is the review? The Cochrane Review authors searched for studies published up to 12 July 2018.
