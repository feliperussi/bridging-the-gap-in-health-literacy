Carotid endarterectomy for carotid stenosis in patients selected for coronary artery bypass graft surgery 
People who have coronary artery disease requiring coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery often have narrowing of other arteries. If the carotid artery, the artery carrying blood to the brain, is narrow (called carotid stenosis), this may increase the risk of stroke and other brain damage, complicating CABG surgery. Surgery to remove the carotid narrowing might prevent these complications of CABG surgery, but also has risks. We found no reliable evidence from randomised trials to indicate whether or not to perform preventive carotid surgery in patients who are going to have CABG surgery.
