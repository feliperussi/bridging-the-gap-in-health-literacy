Prophylactic administration of colony‐stimulating factors reduces hospital stay and risk of infections in children with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia 
The authors evaluated the efficacy of adding colony‐stimulating factors (CSF) after chemotherapy in children with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) to prevent febrile neutropenia, which is a potentially life‐threatening side effect of treatment.   There is a lack of studies to determine the best CSF dose for children and only a small number of RCTs evaluating the role of CSF in children's ALL. The prophylactic administration of CSF reduces hospital stay, and risk of infections. The authors did not find evidence that CSF reduces febrile neutropenia episodes, their duration, or treatment delays in children with ALL undergoing chemotherapy. Follow up was too short to provide useful information on any possible effect on relapse or survival.
