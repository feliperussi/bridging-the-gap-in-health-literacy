Interventions to improve question formulation in professional practice and self‚Äêdirected learning 
Health professionals ask questions as part of their daily practice lives. They can ask questions for a number of reasons including whether or not their knowledge is current (e.g. 'what is the best drug to use for this disease') or to reflect on whether or not they have made the best decision (e.g. 'is there anything else I could have done differently to improve this patient's care?'). We know less about how to increase the number of questions they ask and how to increase the quality of the questions they ask. Questions, and how they are structured, can have an important impact on how healthcare professionals search for information, speak with colleagues, and learn in practice. 
Health professionals are doctors, nurses, physiotherapists, pharmacists, occupational therapists, and anyone who provides direct patient care. 
This review shows that there were some small improvements in the quality of questions created by healthcare professionals following some training (and in some cases the use of informational pamphlets), but we are uncertain how long these improvements last over time. With so little information we cannot make specific, or concrete, conclusions. We did not find information that would tell us what interventions are effective for increasing the number of questions asked and we suggest that this should be an area of research in the future.
