Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) supplements for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in children and adolescents 
Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a major problem in children and adolescents and can result in long‐term social, academic and mental health problems. Stimulant medications, such as methylphenidate and amphetamine, are the most frequently used treatments for ADHD but are not always effective and can be associated with side effects. There is evidence that ADHD could be related to deficiencies of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) and, in particular, omega‐3 PUFA; therefore, PUFA supplementation may improve ADHD symptoms and associated problems. The aim of this review was to evaluate whether PUFA supplements are an effective treatment for children and adolescents with ADHD. Although there were some limited data that did indicate there may be some improvement, overall there was little evidence that PUFA supplementation is beneficial. Further high‐quality research needs to be done.
