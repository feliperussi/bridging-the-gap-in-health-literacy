Patient education shows short‐term benefits for adults with rheumatoid arthritis.
The purpose was to examine the effectiveness of patient education interventions on health status (pain, functional disability, psychological well‐being and disease activity) in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Patient education had a small beneficial effect at first follow‐up for disability, joint counts, patient global assessment, psychological status, and depression. At final follow‐up (3‐14 months) no evidence of significant benefits was found.
