Interventions for replacing missing teeth: different times for loading dental implants
When people have dental implants in their jaws, they usually wait several months for the bone around the implants to heal before artificial teeth are attached to the implant. During this period they use removable dentures. This review looked at the effects of attaching artificial teeth either the same day that the implant was placed, or early (after only 6 weeks) compared to the usual delay of at least 3 months. Some studies also compared the artifical tooth being attached so that it did not touch the opposite tooth (non‚Äêocclusal loading). The search of studies was updated on 8th June 2012. The review found no evidence that attaching artificial teeth either immediately, after 6 weeks (early) or after at least 3 months (conventional) led to any important differences in the failure of the implant or the artifical tooth, or to the amount of bone which surrounded the implant (any bone loss would be an undesirable consequence). More research is needed in this area.
