Silicone gel sheeting for preventing the development of hypertrophic and keloid scars and for treating existing hypertrophic and keloid scars 
As a wound heals, a scar can develop. Sometimes scars can develop abnormally, forming hypertrophic or keloid scars which are raised, unsightly and can cause both emotional problems and issues with movement for the people in which they develop. These types of scar are difficult to treat.  
Keloid scarring is more common in darker skin and occurs after minor injuries such as insect bites, ear piercing and vaccinations. Keloid scars can also spread to the skin surrounding the injured area. Hypertrophic scarring is more common in lighter skin and is usually confined to the area injured. Hypertrophic scarring tends to follow surgery or burns. Hypertrophic and keloid scars are more likely to develop if the injury is on certain sites of the body, for example the lower face, neck and upper arms.  
Silicone gel sheeting is a soft, self‐adhesive sheet that is applied to intact skin. It is thought to prevent the development of new abnormal scars and also to treat existing scars. This review aimed to assess the evidence on whether silicone gel sheeting prevents the development of abnormal scars in people with newly healed wounds or if it is an effective way to treat existing abnormal scars. Most of the studies identified were of poor quality and it is unclear whether silicone gel sheeting helps prevent abnormal scarring, or is effective in treating existing abnormal scars.
