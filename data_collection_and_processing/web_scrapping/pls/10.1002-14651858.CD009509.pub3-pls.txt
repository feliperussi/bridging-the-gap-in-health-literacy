Multidisciplinary rehabilitation after brain tumour treatment
People with brain tumours can experience a range of symptoms and disabilities, such as psychological problems, difficulties with mobility or self care, and relationship and work issues, which can substantially impact their quality of life. These symptoms and disabilities may be addressed through 'multidisciplinary rehabilitation' delivered by a team of different healthcare professionals (for example doctors, nurses, therapists) working in an organised manner. 
We found one controlled clinical trial (poor quality) that compared multidisciplinary rehabilitation to standard outpatient care. The 106 people in this trial received treatment in the hospital outpatient clinic. Participants were in the multidisciplinary rehabilitation programme for up to eight weeks, and the results were measured at three and six months after completion of the programme. 
There was some evidence to support the benefit of multidisciplinary rehabilitation in reducing disability in people with primary brain tumour. People in the multidisciplinary rehabilitation group showed improvement in their functional abilities (e.g. continence, mobility) and cognitive function compared to the group with standard care only. Multidisciplinary rehabilitation was not harmful. Current research gaps highlight the need for high‐quality research to explore the effectiveness of various aspects of multidisciplinary rehabilitation and caregiver needs in this patient population. 
The evidence in this review is up to date to January 2015.
