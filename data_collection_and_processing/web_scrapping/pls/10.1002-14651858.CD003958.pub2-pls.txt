Adrenaline for prevention of morbidity and mortality in preterm infants with cardiovascular compromise 
Not enough evidence from trials on the use of adrenaline (epinephrine) for preterm babies with poor heart rates and circulation. Sustained poor blood flow in preterm babies can lead to complications, including impaired development. Inotrope drugs, particularly dopamine and dobutamine, are commonly used to increase heart rate and blood pressure in preterm babies with poor circulation. Adrenaline (epinephrine) is another inotrope drug that can be used. The review found that there is not enough evidence from trials to show the effects of adrenaline on preterm babies with poor circulation, and more research is needed.
