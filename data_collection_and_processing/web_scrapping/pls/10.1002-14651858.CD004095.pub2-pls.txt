Long‐term non‐pharmacological weight loss interventions for adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus 
Most persons with type 2 diabetes are overweight, and the health of these persons can be improved with weight loss. Weight loss is very difficult to achieve in the long‐term, however, particularly among persons with diabetes. This systematic review of diet, physical activity, and behavioral interventions for weight loss, revealed a decrease in weight of 1.7 kg at one year or more. These results were minimized by weight loss in the comparison group, however. No data were identified on quality of life or mortality.
