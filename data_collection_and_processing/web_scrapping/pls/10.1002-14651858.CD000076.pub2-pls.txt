Electroconvulsive therapy for schizophrenia
The induction of a seizure (fit) for therapeutic purposes by the administration of an electrical stimulus (electroconvulsive therapy or ECT) remains a common treatment option for people with schizophrenia. This review pools data from 26 studies that included over 798 participants in receipt of this treatment. The evidence suggests that courses of ECT can, in the short term, result in an increase in global improvement for some people with schizophrenia.
