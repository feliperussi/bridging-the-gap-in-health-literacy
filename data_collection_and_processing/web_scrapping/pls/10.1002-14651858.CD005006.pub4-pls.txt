Different anthracycline derivates for reducing cardiotoxicity in cancer patients
Anthracyclines are among the most effective chemotherapy treatments available for various types of cancer. However, there is a risk of damage to the heart depending on the cumulative dose. In an effort to prevent heart damage different anthracycline derivates (like doxorubicin, daunorubicin, and epirubicin) are being used. 
The authors found that for the use of many different combinations of anthracycline derivates there was no high quality evidence available and it was impossible to draw conclusions. 
For the use of epirubicin versus doxorubicin, there was some suggestion of a lower rate of clinical heart failure in patients treated with epirubicin. There is no evidence which suggests a difference in anti‐tumour response rate and survival between epirubicin and doxorubicin. No conclusions can be made regarding adverse effects. There are no data for children and patients with leukaemia. Further research is needed. For the use of doxorubicin versus liposomal‐encapsulated doxorubicin, the authors found a significantly lower rate of both clinical heart failure and subclinical heart failure (i.e. various cardiac abnormalities, diagnosed with different diagnostic methods like echocardiography in asymptomatic patients) in patients treated with liposomal‐encapsulated doxorubicin. There is no evidence which suggests a difference in anti‐tumour response rate and survival between doxorubicin and liposomal‐encapsulated doxorubicin. A lower rate of adverse effects was identified in patients treated with liposomal‐encapsulated doxorubicin. There are no data for children and patients with leukaemia. Further research is needed.
