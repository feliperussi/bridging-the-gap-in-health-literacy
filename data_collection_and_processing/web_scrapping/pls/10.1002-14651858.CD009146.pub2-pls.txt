Hormone replacement for osteoporosis in women with primary biliary cirrhosis
Patients with primary biliary cirrhosis are mainly elderly women who are naturally prone to osteoporosis. Hormone replacement has been used worldwide to treat symptoms of menopause and to prevent chronic conditions such as osteoporosis. However, hormone replacement is associated with an increase in adverse events, several of which are serious. This review assessed the effect of hormone replacement on treatment of osteoporosis in women with primary biliary cirrhosis. We found no evidence of effect of hormone replacement on mortality and fractures in women with primary biliary cirrhosis. It seems that hormone replacement given to women with primary biliary cirrhosis is connected with a significant increase in the occurrence of adverse events compared with placebo or no intervention. Hormone replacement appears to have no effect on the lumbar bone mineral density compared with placebo or no intervention. Hormone replacement may decrease bone mineral density measured at the proximal femur. We did not find evidence to support the use of hormone replacement for osteoporosis in women with primary biliary cirrhosis.
