Haloperidol for the treatment of nausea and vomiting in palliative care patients
Haloperidol is often used to help control nausea (feeling sick) or vomiting (being sick), both of which are common problems for patients with serious life‐threatening illnesses. Haloperidol can be given by mouth or by injection. There has been some research looking at how this drug works in nausea and vomiting caused by surgery and when trying to prevent nausea and vomiting caused by anti‐cancer treatments. 
This is an update of the original review published in 2009 for which no studies met the inclusion criteria. For this update, in a search of the published literature in November 2014 we found one moderate quality randomised controlled trial which compared ABH (Ativan®, Benadryl®, Haldol®) gel, containing haloperidol and two other medications, to placebo. 
The trial showed no difference between ABH gel and placebo. However it has previously been shown that haloperidol is not absorbed after applying ABH gel, so this result is not surprising. We identified a trial of haloperidol for nausea and vomiting in patients with cancer, with initial results presented at a conference. This suggests that haloperidol is effective in 65% of patients, but the results were not fully published at the time of our review. A further trial has opened in Australia, comparing haloperidol with another medication used for nausea, methotrimeprazine (levomepromazine).
