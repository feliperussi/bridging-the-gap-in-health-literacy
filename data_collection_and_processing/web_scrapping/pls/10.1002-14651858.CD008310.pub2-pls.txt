Nebulised surfactant in preterm infants with or at risk of respiratory distress syndrome
There is insufficient evidence from randomised controlled trials to guide the use of nebulised surfactant in preterm infants at risk of respiratory distress syndrome.  Respiratory distress syndrome is caused by a deficiency of the naturally occurring lining chemicals of the lung (surfactant) and occurs mainly in infants born before term (37 weeks' gestation). Usual treatment includes instilling artificial surfactant directly into the newborn infant's trachea followed by mechanical ventilation. However, this process can lead to lung injury, which can affect the infant's long‐term health. A potential alternative strategy is to use nebulised surfactant. This procedure has the potential to reduce the need for tracheal intubation after birth and subsequent lung damage caused by mechanical ventilation. This review found one small randomised controlled trial of nebulised surfactant administration in preterm infants with respiratory distress syndrome that reported no beneficial effect of nebulised surfactant. This study is too small and has a moderate risk of bias making conclusions uncertain. In view of the encouraging results from other observational studies, high‐quality trials of nebulised surfactant in preterm infants with or at risk of respiratory distress syndrome are justified.
