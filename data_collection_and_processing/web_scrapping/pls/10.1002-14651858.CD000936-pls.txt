Labour assessment programs to delay admission to labour wards
Pregnant women coming into hospital with signs of labour, may benefit from formal assessment by a specialised program. 
Hospital labour assessment programs are specialised programs that confirm whether women coming into hospital with signs of labour, are in active labour (with the neck of the womb opening), before going to labour ward. Women with full term pregnancies in these programs spend time in the assessment unit, walk in the grounds, go home or are admitted to labour ward. The review found they have shorter labour ward stays, feel more control and use fewer drugs to progress labour or for pain relief. There is not enough evidence on other effects on the mother or baby or on unplanned out‐of‐hospital birth.
