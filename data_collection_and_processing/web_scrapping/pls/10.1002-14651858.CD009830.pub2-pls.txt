Haloperidol for long‐term aggression in psychosis
Background 
People experiencing distressing delusions and hallucinations can often become agitated and aggressive. The antipsychotic drug haloperidol is widely used for the treatment of schizophrenia and psychosis‐induced agitation despite the possibility it can cause a number of serious side effects such as nausea, vomiting, dizziness, restlessness and muscle spasms. 
Study characteristics 
The Cochrane Schizophrenia Group ran an electronic search for clinical trials involving the use of haloperidol for psychosis‐induced aggression in July 2011 and April 2015. We found one study with 110 participants, diagnosed with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder. Participants had been physically aggressive during recent hospitalisation and involved in at least one other aggressive event. The study randomised participants to receive either haloperidol, clozapine or olanzapine. 
Key results 
Most data presented were impossible to use and it is unclear if haloperidol is effective for reducing aggression or improving mental state for people who are aggressive due to psychosis. There were no data regarding side effects. The number of people leaving the study early from each treatment group was similar. 
Quality of evidence 
The quality of evidence available is low, only one study with a high risk of selective reporting of results provided data. No firm conclusions can be made until further good‐quality data are available.
