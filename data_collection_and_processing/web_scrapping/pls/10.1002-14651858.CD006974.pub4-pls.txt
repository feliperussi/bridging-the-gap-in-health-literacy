Stem cell transplantation for treating Gaucher disease
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the effect of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) in people with Gaucher disease. 
Background 
Gaucher disease is an inherited disorder caused by a deficiency of the enzyme glucocerebrosidase. This leads to storage of complex lipids in some types of blood cells. Due to these abnormal cells people with Gaucher disease will have pain, fatigue, anemia, jaundice and bone damage. Some forms of Gaucher disease may also cause neurological damage. The treatment of Gaucher disease at present is mainly by enzyme replacement therapy which is expensive. In some severe cases HSCT is used to treat people with Gaucher disease. This is a high risk procedure sometimes leading to death of the individual. 
Search date 
The evidence is current to: 19 January 2017.
Study characteristics 
We have not found any trials to show the effectiveness and the risks of the procedure in people with Gaucher disease. 
Key results 
We have not found any trials assessing the effectiveness and the risks of the procedure in people with Gaucher disease. There are no trials included in the review and we have not identified any relevant trials up to January 2017. We therefore do not plan to update this review until new trials are published. 
Quality of the evidence 
We have not found any trials assessing the effectiveness and the risks of the procedure in people with Gaucher disease.
