Vision screening of older drivers to prevent road traffic injuries and deaths
Good vision is critical for safe driving performance. Because vision declines with age, and the percentage of older adults in the population is increasing, it has become more important to consider the vision screening requirements for older adults when designing evidence‐based traffic safety policy. Mandatory vision screening for the issue or renewal of a driver's licence helps to ensure that older drivers are fit to safely operate vehicles.To date, there has been no trial to demonstrate the impact of vision screening on the prevention of older driver‐related crashes. However, given the importance of good vision for safe driving, vision testing remains a relevant issue for all licensed drivers.
