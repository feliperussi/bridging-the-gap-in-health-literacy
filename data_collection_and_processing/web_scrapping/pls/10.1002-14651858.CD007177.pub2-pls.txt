Electrical stimulation for thigh muscle strengthening before and after knee replacement surgery 
This summary of a Cochrane review presents what we know about the effect of electrical stimulation as a treatment to improve the strength of the thigh muscles before and after  knee replacement surgery. 
 
The review shows that we are uncertain whether electrical stimulation affects thigh muscle strength before and after knee replacement surgery because of the very low quality of the evidence. 
 
What is thigh muscle weakness and what is electrical stimulation? 
Osteoarthritis of the knee can make the knee joint painful and unstable.  Knee replacement surgery is a treatment that can sometimes help this condition.   One side effect of having knee surgery, is that people can lose strength in their thigh muscles.  When your thigh muscles are weak, it can be difficult to stand from a sitting position.  Up to a year later, some people walk and climb stairs more slowly than they did before surgery.  
Electrical stimulation means using electricity to make the thigh muscle contract,  just as it would if a person were exercising.  Electrodes are wires that send the electrical current from a small machine to your thigh muscle.  Usually, a doctor or physiotherapist will connect electrodes with tape to the skin on your thigh.  The treatment is usually given as part of an overall exercise program.
