Laparoscopic versus open liver resection for benign and malignant hepatic lesions in adults 
Conventionally, resection of benign and malignant liver lesions has been carried out using an open approach. This technique involves one long incision in the abdominal wall and removal of the lesion under direct vision. In the last two decades, laparoscopic surgery has gained the interest of surgeons, particularly in liver surgery, where resection of lesions is achieved using several small skin incisions in the abdominal wall and the operation is conducted under keyhole camera vision. This comparison of the efficacy and safety of both procedures for liver resection was inconclusive as there were no randomised clinical trials.
