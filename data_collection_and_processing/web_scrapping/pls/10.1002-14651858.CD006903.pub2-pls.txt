Peer support telephone calls to improve health and health behaviours
Telephone peer support is widely available through helplines but its impact on health outcomes and health‐related behaviours is largely unknown. We examined the effects of peer support telephone calls on physical and psychological health and on health behaviours. Seven randomised controlled trials conducted in the USA, UK, Canada and Australia related to a range of conditions and target populations. They provided some evidence of efficacy. Peer support telephone calls may increase mammography screening in women over 40 years, may help patients change their diet and cease smoking after a heart attack; and may help reduce depressive symptoms among mothers with postnatal depression. Findings need to be interpreted cautiously. There is a need for well designed randomised controlled studies to clarify which elements of peer telephone interventions work best to improve health and health‐related behaviour.
