Intravenous versus inhalation anaesthesia for one窶人ung ventilation
Clinicians may choose to ventilate only one of a patient's two lungs either during surgery or during a period of intensive care. Possible reasons are to facilitate the performance of surgery, to prevent lung rupture, and to prevent contamination of one lung by the other. During one窶人ung ventilation, anaesthesia is maintained by delivery of an inhalation anaesthetic, such as sevoflurane, to the ventilated lung, or by infusion of an intravenous anaesthetic, for example, propofol. It is possible that the method chosen to maintain anaesthesia may affect patient outcomes. We included 20 studies that enrolled 850 participants in this updated systematic review. The methodological quality of the included studies was uncertain because of poor reporting. No evidence indicated that the drug used to maintain anaesthesia during one窶人ung ventilation affected patient outcomes. Researchers should include outcomes that are important to participants when assessing the effects of anaesthetic technique during one窶人ung ventilation. These include adverse postoperative effects, death and intraoperative awareness. 
We reran the search in February 2017 and found four potential studies of interest which have been added to a list of 'Studies awaiting Classification' and will be incorporated into the formal review findings during the review update.
