What is the best regimen of proton pump inhibitors for bleeding peptic ulcers?
Bleeding from ulcers in the stomach or duodenum is a common and serious medical emergency. Such ulcers are usually caused by anti‐inflammatory medications or chronic infection of the stomach with a bacterium called Helicobacter pylori.Bleeding from those ulcers usually manifests as vomiting of blood or passing black, tarry stools. Treatment with proton pump inhibitors (PPIs ‐ drugs that reduce the amount of acid in the stomach and duodenum, thereby stabilizing the clot that stops the bleeding), has been previously shown to be beneficial for these patients. However, the best dose and route of administration (oral or intravenous) of PPIs in this situation is controversial. 
By systematically reviewing all available research, we found that the best dose and route of administration of PPIs cannot yet be determined. Our results show that, with regards to deaths, rebleeding episodes, emergency surgeries and need for repeat endoscopic treatments, it is not certain if high intravenous doses of PPIs are more, less or equally effective compared to lower (oral or intravenous) doses of PPIs.
