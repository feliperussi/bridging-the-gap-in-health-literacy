The effect of anti‐spasticity agents in people with multiple sclerosis
Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic disease of the nervous system which affects young and middle‐aged adults. Spasticity, a common problem in people with MS, is a disorder of voluntary movement caused by damage to the central nervous system. The main sign is the resistance to passive movement of a limb but other associated features ‐ pain, spasms, loss of function ‐ affect people's quality of life more directly.  Many anti‐spasticity drugs are available but the review of trials found that there is not enough evidence to compare their effectiveness.  More research is needed.
