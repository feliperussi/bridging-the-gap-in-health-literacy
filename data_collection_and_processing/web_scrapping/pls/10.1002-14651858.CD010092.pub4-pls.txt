Patient support programmes (psychosocial interventions) for improving quality of life in adults undergoing squint surgery 
Background 
Strabismus, also known as squint, is the misalignment of a person's eyes. It can result in an obvious squint noticeable by other people, as well as symptoms of double vision or blurred vision. Adults who have a squint often undergo surgery to alleviate these signs and symptoms. Although people report improvements in quality of life as a result of strabismus surgery, some people experience no change or a deterioration in quality of life, despite good clinical outcomes. Pre‐surgery psychosocial interventions can improve patient reported outcomes in other long‐term conditions. In this Cochrane review we aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of psychosocial interventions delivered prior to strabismus surgery in order to optimise quality of life postoperatively. We searched up to February 2016. We found no studies that evaluated the impact of psychosocial interventions on patients undergoing squint surgery. We believe future research should focus on developing and evaluating the use of targeted psychosocial interventions to improve a patient's quality of life after strabismus surgery.
