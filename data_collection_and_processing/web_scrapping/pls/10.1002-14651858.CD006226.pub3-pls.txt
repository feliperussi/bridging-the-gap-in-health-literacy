Long versus short course treatment with Metformin + Clomiphene Citrate for ovulation induction in women with PCOS 
Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is the most common endocrinopathy among women of reproductive‐age. Apart from infertility, women with PCOS often have other endocrine disorders, including insulin resistance, hyperinsulinaemia and hyperandrogenism. Metformin combined with clomiphene citrate (CC), has been shown to be more effective in ovulation induction than clomiphene citrate alone. The optimal duration for metformin pretreatment before initiation of clomiphene citrate, however, is unknown. There have been no trials conducted to determine the effectiveness of short‐course (less than four weeks) metformin plus clomiphene citrate compared to the conventional long‐course (four weeks or more) metformin plus clomiphene citrate with regard to ovulation and achievement of pregnancy in infertile women with polycystic ovary syndrome.
