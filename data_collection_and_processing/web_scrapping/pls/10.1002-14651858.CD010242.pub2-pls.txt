Mycophenolate mofetil for relapsing‐remitting multiple sclerosis
Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an immune‐mediated disease of the central nervous system. Preliminary data show that mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), an immunosuppressive agent, might be beneficial for MS patients. The authors of this review evaluated the efficacy and safety of MMF in patients with relapsing‐remitting MS. Only one small study met the inclusion criteria, and it compared MMF versus placebo in 26 interferon β‐1a–treated patients. The results showed no evidence favoring MMF in reducing relapses or preventing disability progression after a 12‐month follow‐up period. No data were available at 24 months. All patients receiving MMF suffered from gastrointestinal upset, and one had a transient diarrhea, but no serious adverse effects were reported.
