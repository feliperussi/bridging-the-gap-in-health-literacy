No evidence from trials on the effects of non‐surgical treatments for late radiation cystitis, and more research on drugs inserted into the bladder is worthwhile 
Radiotherapy to the pelvic area for gynaecological cancer can damage the bladder in some women. This can lead to late radiation cystitis, which can cause urinary problems (including pain), blood in the urine, reduced bladder capacity and/or bladder damage. There can be a cycle of bleeding, infection and occasionally life‐threatening complications. Options include treating infections, blood transfusion, catheters (tubes) to release urine, drugs inserted into the bladder, and surgery. The review found there is no evidence from trials to determine the effects of non‐surgical treatments for late radiation cystitis, although some drugs inserted into the bladder might help.
