Applying negative pressure rapidly or in steps for vacuum extraction assisted vaginal delivery 
Assisted vaginal delivery is an important part of obstetric care. Indications for its use include prolonged second stage of labour, actual or potential fetal compromise or distress, and to shorten labour. The established methods facilitate the descent and birth of the infant. A vacuum extractor is becoming the method of choice as it is less likely to injure the mother although failure of attempted vacuum extraction may occur more often than with forceps. Rapid application addresses the benefit of vacuum extraction that can be used when rapid delivery is required. Two good quality randomized controlled trials involving 754 women were identified. Rapid negative pressure application reduced the duration of the procedure without any evidence of differences in outcomes for the mother or infant. Rapid method of negative pressure application should be recommended for vacuum extraction assisted vaginal delivery.
