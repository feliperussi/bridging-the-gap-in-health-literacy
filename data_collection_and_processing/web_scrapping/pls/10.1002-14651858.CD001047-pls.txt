Fencing which completely encloses all sides of a swimming pool and isolates it from the home is effective in preventing drowning of young children 
In most industrialized countries, drowning is one of the top killers of children, especially young children. Medical care offers little to help drowning victims, and thus survival must rely on prevention of the drowning. The review found no trials of pool fencing. However evidence from other studies found that pool fencing that adequately prevents children reaching the pool unsupervised can prevent about three‚Äêquarters of all child drownings in pools. Fencing which completely encircles the pool and isolates it from the house is much more effective than methods where children can still gain access to the pool through the house.
