Selenium supplementation to prevent short‚Äêterm morbidity in preterm neonates
Higher doses of selenium supplements may be able to reduce some complications for preterm babies, but more research is needed. Selenium is an essential trace element gained from nutrients. Babies are born with lower selenium concentrations in their blood than their mothers. In very preterm babies, low selenium is associated with an increased risk of complications. The review of trials of selenium supplementation for preterm babies found that it reduces sepsis (blood infection). It has not been shown to reduce other complications or increase survival. No adverse effects were reported. Higher than usual levels of selenium supplementation may be beneficial, but more research is needed as most of the evidence comes from a country where selenium levels were unusually low.
