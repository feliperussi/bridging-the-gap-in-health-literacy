Dihydrocodeine in a single dose in the treatment of acute postoperative pain
This review assessed the efficacy of single‐dose dihydrocodeine in adults with moderate/severe postoperative pain using information from randomised placebo controlled trials. There was a lack of data that could be included in the analyses; all assessed the oral form of the drug and none assessed dihydrocodeine 60 mg. The results were not robust. The implication was that single‐dose oral dihydrocodeine 30 mg was more effective than placebo, but was inferior to ibuprofen 400 mg. Dizziness, drowsiness and confusion were commonly reported.
