Danazol is an effective treatment for the reduction of heavy menstrual bleeding, but the adverse effects may be unacceptable to women 
Options to help avoid surgery can be important for many women who are having problems with heavy menstrual bleeding. One of the drug options is Danazol. Danazol suppresses the hormones that increase the endometrium (the lining of the uterus that is shed during menstruation). However, Danazol can also produce male characteristics and some menopause‚Äêlike symptoms, as well as weight gain and acne. The review found that although Danazol is effective at reducing menstrual blood loss there are not enough trials to show whether this treatment is acceptable to women with heavy menstrual bleeding.
