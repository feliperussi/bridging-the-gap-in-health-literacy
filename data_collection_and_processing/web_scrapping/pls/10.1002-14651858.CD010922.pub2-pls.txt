High‐pressure oxygen therapy for children and adults with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) 
Background 
Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is associated with problems in social communication and restricted behaviors. High‐pressure (hyperbaric) oxygen therapy has been proposed as treatment for these ASD symptoms. We reviewed the evidence on effects of high‐pressure (hyperbaric) oxygen therapy among children and adults with ASD. We also assessed the evidence on the safety of high‐pressure oxygen therapy. 
Review question 
Does high‐pressure oxygen therapy improve social communication or other aspects of function in children and adults with ASD, and how safe is this therapy? 
Study characteristics 
We searched electronic databases and identified randomized controlled trials (in which participants are randomly allocated to one of two or more treatment groups) consisting of participants who received high‐pressure oxygen therapy or room air or no treatment as a control. 
The evidence is current up to December 2015.
Key results 
We found a single, small study of 60 children that evaluated high‐pressure oxygen therapy for ASD. 
There was no evidence that high‐pressure oxygen therapy improved social interaction, behavioral problems, speech or language communication, or mental function in children with ASD. However, children who received high‐pressure (hyperbaric) oxygen therapy showed an increased occurrence of ear barotrauma events when compared with those in the control group. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the evidence is low. Evidence is insufficient to confirm that high‐pressure oxygen is an effective treatment for individuals with ASD.
