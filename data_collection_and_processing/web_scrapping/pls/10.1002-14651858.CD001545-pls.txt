Chemotherapy improves the survival of people with advanced colorectal cancer, but the adverse effects and impact on quality of life are not yet known. 
Colorectal (bowel) cancer is common worldwide, but can often be treated effectively with surgery. In some people, however, the cancer returns and sometimes also spread to other parts of the body. When this happens, chemotherapy (anti‚Äêcancer drugs) can be used to try to slow the progression of the cancer. However, chemotherapy also have adverse effects.  The review of trials found that chemotherapy improves survival of people with advanced colorectal cancer. However, the effects of treatment upon quality of life are not yet clear and need more study.
