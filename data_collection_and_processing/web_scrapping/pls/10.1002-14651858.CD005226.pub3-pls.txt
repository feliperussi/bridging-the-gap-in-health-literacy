Drug therapy for pain in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis or motor neuron disease
Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), also known as motor neuron disease (MND), is the most common neurodegenerative disorder of the motor system in adults. Pain is a frequent symptom and may have a pronounced impact on quality of life and suffering. Despite an extensive search of different medical databases, this review was not able to identify any randomised controlled trials on drug therapy for pain in ALS. Currently (to July 2012) no evidence exists for using one type of treatment over another.
