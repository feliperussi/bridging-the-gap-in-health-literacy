Oral non steroid anti‚Äêinflammatories for children and adults with bronchiectasis
Infection and inflammation play an important role in the symptomatology and disease progression in patients with bronchiectasis. Anti inflammatory drugs may reduce the inflammatory cascade and thus may be beneficial in people with bronchiectasis. Using the standard search module of the Cochrane Airways Group, no randomised controlled trials that assessed the use of oral non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in bronchiectasis were found. Thus the routine use of NSAIDs in bronchiectasis cannot be recommended.
