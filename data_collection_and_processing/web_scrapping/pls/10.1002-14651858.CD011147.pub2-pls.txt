Infant pacifiers for reduction in risk of sudden infant death syndrome
Review question 
Does the use of infant pacifiers (dummies) reduce the risk of sudden infant death syndrome? 
Background 
Sudden unexpected death of an infant generally occurs during sleep from birth to one year of age but mainly occurs between one and four months of age. Despite the success of several prevention campaigns, sudden infant death syndrome remains a leading cause of infant mortality (death). A variety of factors have been identified as increasing the risk of sudden infant death syndrome such as male sex, preterm (before the due date) birth, overheating, exposure to cigarette smoke, and infants lying on their stomachs. Pacifier use has been proposed as a non‐invasive intervention to reduce the risk of SIDS. This review was undertaken to examine whether infant pacifiers can reduce the risk of SIDS. 
Study characteristics 
We searched medical databases for clinical trials of SIDS in infants born at their due date or earlier (less than 37 weeks of pregnancy) or with low birth weight (less than 2500 g) using pacifiers or not using pacifiers up to one year of age. We found no well‐designed clinical trials meeting our inclusion criteria. 
Results 
No well‐designed clinical trials met our inclusion criteria.
