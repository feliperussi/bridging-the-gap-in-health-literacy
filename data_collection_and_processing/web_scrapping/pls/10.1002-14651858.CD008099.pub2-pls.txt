Single dose oral codeine, as a single agent, for acute postoperative pain in adults
This review assessed evidence from 2411 adults with moderate to severe postoperative pain in studies comparing single doses of codeine 60 mg with placebo. The number of individuals achieving a clinically useful amount of pain relief (at least 50%) with codeine compared to placebo was low. In all types of surgery combined, 12 participants would need to be treated with codeine 60 mg for one to experience this amount of pain relief who would not have done so with placebo. The need for use of additional analgesia within 4 to 6 hours was 38% with codeine compared with 46% with placebo, and the mean time to the use of additional analgesia was only slightly longer with codeine (2.7 hours) than with placebo (2 hours). More individuals experienced adverse events with codeine than with placebo, but the difference was not significant and none were serious or led to withdrawal. Other commonly used analgesics, alone and in combination with codeine 60 mg, provide better pain relief. Higher doses of codeine were not investigated in these studies.
