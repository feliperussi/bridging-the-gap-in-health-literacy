Domiciliary oxygen for interstitial lung disease
Oxygen therapy is used to treat patients with interstitial lung disease (ILD) with low arterial blood oxygen levels. This review evaluated the effect of domiciliary long‐term oxygen therapy on survival and quality of life in patients with ILD. Only one randomized controlled trial was identified. This unpublished study reported that long‐term oxygen therapy did not improve survival compared with no oxygen therapy in patients with ILD. No data on quality of life was available.
