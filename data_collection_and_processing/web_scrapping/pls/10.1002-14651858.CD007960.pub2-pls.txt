Anticonvulsants for tinnitus
Tinnitus is the perception of sound or noise in the absence of external acoustic stimulation. It is a common and potentially distressing symptom for which no adequate therapy exists. The pathophysiology of tinnitus has been compared to phantom limb pain therefore anticonvulsant drugs have been proposed as a possible therapy. 
This review includes seven studies (six low‐quality and one high‐quality) of four different anticonvulsants (gabapentin, carbamazepine, flunarizine and lamotrigine). We found that anticonvulsants do not have a beneficial effect in the treatment of tinnitus. Side effects of the anticonvulsants used were experienced by 18% of patients.
