Surgery for the treatment of traumatic optic neuropathy
The optic nerve transmits visual information from the eye to the brain and traumatic optic neuropathy (TON) refers to any injury to the optic nerve secondary to trauma. After the optic nerve has been injured, it becomes more swollen and this can lead to further damage. Traumatic optic neuropathy often results in severe visual loss and the vast majority of affected patients are young males in their thirties. Surgery has been used in TON to try and reduce this abnormal swelling or remove bone fragments. There are currently no good quality studies that show greater visual improvement following surgery compared to no treatment. Surgery carries a definite risk of complications which must be considered.
