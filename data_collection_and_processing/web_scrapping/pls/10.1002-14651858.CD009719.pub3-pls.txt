Continuous versus intermittent bolus feeding for gastro‐oesophageal reflux disease
Review question 
Does continuous or intermittent bolus intragastric tube feeding reduce reflux of milk into the oesophagus? 
Background 
Preterm and low birth weight infants are often unable to be fed orally because they cannot suck and swallow effectively. They may need to be fed via a tube placed into the stomach (intragastric). Tube feeding can be given by the intermittent bolus method, whereby milk is given over a short time (15 to 30 minutes), or by the continuous feeding method, by which milk is given over several hours. It is unclear which method is better for reducing reflux of milk into the oesophagus. 
Study characteristics 
The search is up‐to‐date as of July 2020. We identified no studies.
Key results 
We did not identify any studies that could be included in this review. Studies are needed to evaluate which method of intragastric feeding is more effective for reducing gastro‐oesophageal reflux in preterm and low birth weight infants 
Certainty of evidence 
We found no randomised controlled trials and therefore recommend that well‐designed randomised trials be conducted to conclusively prove which method is more appropriate.
