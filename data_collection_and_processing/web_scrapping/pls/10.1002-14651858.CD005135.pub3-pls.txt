Laser‐assisted in‐situ keratomileusis (LASIK) compared to photorefractive keratectomy (PRK) for correcting short‐sightedness 
Myopia is the term used to describe short or near‐sightedness, which means that you cannot see objects in the distance clearly. Most people with myopia wear spectacles or contact lenses. Glasses can be uncomfortable and are not practical for sport; contact lenses can be associated with corneal infections. For these reasons, some people choose to have surgery for myopia. Two commonly used surgical techniques are LASIK and PRK. Both these procedures use laser to remove corneal tissue and reshape the cornea. This review analyses the results from 13 clinical trials where 1923 eyes of 1135 participants were randomly treated with either LASIK or PRK. We considered the overall quality of evidence from these studies to be low. There was some evidence that LASIK gives a faster visual recovery than PRK, and is a less painful technique, although visual results one year after surgery were comparable. Surgical techniques are improving all the time and further trials are needed to see whether LASIK and PRK, as currently practised, are equally safe.
