Strategies for managing sexual dysfunction caused by antidepressants
Antidepressants can have numerous effects on sexual function including altered sexual desire, erection difficulties and orgasm problems. This systematic review investigated different ways to manage such sexual dysfunction. We included 23 randomised studies, with a total of 1886 participants who had developed their sexual problems while taking antidepressant medication. Twenty‐two of these studies looked at the addition of further medication to the ongoing treatment for depression. For men with antidepressant‐induced erectile dysfunction, the addition of sildenafil (Viagra; three studies, 255 participants) or tadalafil (Cialis; one study, 54 participants) appeared to improve the situation. For women with antidepressant‐induced sexual dysfunction the addition of bupropion (Wellbutrin, Zyban; three studies, 482 participants) at higher doses appears to be the most promising approach studied so far, but further data from randomised trials are likely to be required before it can be recommended confidently. We did not find evidence that any intervention led to a worsening of psychiatric symptoms; however, we cannot be confident of this for many of the interventions studied, as only small numbers of participants have been studied so far.
