Anticholinergic drugs can improve movement symptoms of Parkinson's disease, but with adverse mental effects, and there is not enough evidence to compare the different drugs. 
Anticholinergics were the first drugs available for Parkinson´s disease and they are still widely used. They are believed to work by counteracting an imbalance which exists in Parkinson´s disease between two chemicals in the brain which transmit messages between nerve cells. However, anticholinergic drugs have been associated with unfavourable side effects. They are used alone, or with other anti‐Parkinson's drugs. The review of trials found that anticholinergics can improve movement problems in people with Parkinson's disease, but also cause adverse mental effects (such as confusion, memory problems, restlessness and hallucinations). There is not enough evidence to compare the different anticholinergic drugs.
