Adrenergic drugs for urinary incontinence in adults
Urinary incontinence is the leakage of urine, and when caused by coughing or exercising it is called stress incontinence. It may be caused by damage to muscles either holding up the bladder or holding the bladder neck closed. Adrenergic agonist drugs may help the bladder neck muscle to contract more strongly. This review of 22 trials involving 673 women and seven different adrenergic drugs found weak evidence that adrenergic agonists may help stress urinary incontinence. Side effects do occur but are usually minor. Rarely, more serious adverse effects such as high blood pressure can occur. More evidence is needed to compare adrenergic drugs with other drugs for stress incontinence and also with pelvic floor muscle exercises.
