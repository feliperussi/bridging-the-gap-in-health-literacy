Protein‐containing synthetic surfactant versus protein‐free synthetic surfactant for the prevention and treatment of respiratory distress syndrome 
Respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) is a significant cause of illness in preterm infants. RDS is caused by a deficiency or a dysfunction of the chemicals that line the lung, called pulmonary surfactant. Numerous preparations that contain surfactants of either animal origin or synthetic design have been developed and tested to treat or prevent RDS. In general, these surfactant preparations have decreased lung rupture (pneumothorax), decreased the risk of dying, and increased the number of survivors without lung damage. From previous research, the surfactants that are obtained from animal lungs seem to have a better effect than the synthetic surfactants. This might be due to the surfactant proteins contained in animal surfactant that are absent in the previously available synthetic surfactants.  
Recently developed synthetic surfactant preparations include whole surfactant proteins or parts of the proteins (called peptides) that act like naturally occurring surfactant protein. These preparations have been recently tested in comparison to the protein free synthetic surfactant preparations.  
A recent trial of protein containing synthetic surfactant compared to protein free synthetic surfactant suggests that these protein containing synthetic surfactants help prevent respiratory distress syndrome and may or may not lead to a decrease in lung injury (chronic lung disease). Other clinical outcomes were similar. Further studies will help refine recommendations concerning use of protein containing synthetic surfactants.
