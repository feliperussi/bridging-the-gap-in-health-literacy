The efficacy of sulpiride augmentation for schizophrenia
Schizophrenia is a serious and chronic illness in which psychotic symptoms are prominent. The psychotic symptoms are often managed with drugs. Not all people with schizophrenia respond well to treatment with antipsychotic drugs and sulpiride is often used as an add‐on drug for promoting the efficacy of another medication. Several clinical trials reported effects of sulpiride augmentation for management of schizophrenia. We included four small trials which compared sulpiride plus clozapine with clozapine alone for very ill people. Evidence from the present review suggested that short‐term sulpiride plus clozapine probably is more effective than clozapine alone in producing clinical improvement in some people. The evidence is, however, weak and prone to considerable bias. This is a good area for more research.
