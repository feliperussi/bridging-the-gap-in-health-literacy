Injectable gold for treating rheumatoid arthritis
Injectable gold has been used to treat several conditions since the 18th century. This review included four trials and 415 patients. Patients receiving gold injections had 30% fewer swollen joints compared to patients receiving placebo. Improvements were also found for blood work and patient and physician assessments in those patients receiving gold injections. 22% percent of the treated patients withdrew from toxicity compared to 4% of patients taking placebo.

Although its use can be limited by the incidence of serious harms, injectable gold has an important clinically and statistically significant benefit in the short term treatment of patients with rheumatoid arthritis.
