Traditional Chinese medicinal herbs for induction of remission in advanced or late gastric cancer 
Gastric cancer, one of the malignant tumours in the gastrointestinal tract and with high morbidity among cancers, can easily lead to death once it progresses to an advanced or late stage. There are few interventions which can postpone or stop the malignant course of the illness. However, some kinds of traditional Chinese medicinal herbs (TCMHs) have been used as an alternative therapeutic measure to treat many gastric cancer patients in China, and might be effective as an auxiliary therapy for this illness in its advanced or late stages. Our primary investigation showed there was no assured evidence concerning the effectiveness of TCMHs in improving the quality of life or rate of remission, alleviating the toxic and side effects caused by the chemotherapy, or reducing short‐term mortality. Limited, weak evidence showed that four injections of the TCMHs Huachansu, Aidi, Fufangkushen, and Shenqifuzheng showed statistically significant differences for the improvement of leukopenia, and Huachansu, Aidi, and Fufangkushen for adverse events in the digestive system, but no significant differences in the rate of short‐term remission. Most of the included studies were of low quality and valid comparisons were scarce, meaning that more trials are needed for meta‐analysis to draw definite conclusions about their benefits.
