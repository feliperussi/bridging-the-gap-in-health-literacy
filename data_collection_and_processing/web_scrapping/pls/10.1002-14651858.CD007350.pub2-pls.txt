Thalidomide for induction of remission in Crohn's disease
Crohn's disease is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the bowel. Thalidomide may help to reduce inflammation in the gut and might be effective for the treatment of Crohn's disease. One randomised controlled trial on the use of thalidomide for the treatment of active Crohn's disease (and ulcerative colitis) in children is in progress and should be completed in 2011. One randomised controlled trial using lenalidomide, a drug similar to thalidomide, was identified. This relatively small but well designed study did not demonstrate benefit for lenalidomide treatment of active Crohn's disease. Patients treated with high dose lenalidomide (25 mg/day) were more likely than patients receiving placebo (fake drug) to experience side effects. Side effects in the study included headache, rash and nausea. Known side effects of thalidomide include severe birth defects. The use of thalidomide or lenalidomide for the treatment of active Crohn's disease is not recommended.
