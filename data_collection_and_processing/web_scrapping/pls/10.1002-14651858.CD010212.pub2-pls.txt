Home‐ versus hospital‐based treatment for uncomplicated newborn jaundice in term infants
Newborn infants commonly develop a condition called jaundice. Jaundice occurs as the result of accumulation of a yellowish‐orange pigment called bilirubin in the skin and eyes. Bilirubin in increased concentrations can be damaging to the brain and can have profound long‐term detrimental effects. Phototherapy is a form of treatment used in newborns to reduce levels of bilirubin. "Home‐based phototherapy" can be used in the home setting with appropriate supervision. Home phototherapy is used only in cases of uncomplicated newborn jaundice. Home‐based phototherapy can offer certain advantages such as reduced hospital costs and improved bonding between an infant and mother. On the other hand, home‐based phototherapy could be associated with problems such as increased risk of the damaging effects of bilirubin on the brain and increased risk of readmission to hospital. In this Cochrane review, home‐based phototherapy was compared with hospital‐based phototherapy for uncomplicated jaundice in full‐term newborns. The review authors found no studies that met the eligibility criteria. The authors of this Cochrane review conclude that no high‐quality evidence is currently available to support or refute the use of home phototherapy for uncomplicated newborn jaundice.
