Carbamazepine versus valproate monotherapy for epilepsy
No reliable evidence to distinguish between carbamazepine and valproate for partial onset seizures and generalized onset tonic‐clonic seizures. 
Epilepsy is a disorder where recurrent seizures are caused by abnormal discharges from the brain. Carbamazepine is commonly used to treat partial seizures while valproate is used for generalized seizures. The review of trials found no evidence to support the belief that valproate is superior to carbamazepine for generalized tonic‐clonic seizures. While it was found that younger people fared better on valproate and older people on carbamazepine, this may be because generalized epilepsy is more common in childhood and adolescence.
