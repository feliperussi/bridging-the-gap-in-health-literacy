Behavioral interventions to reduce HIV transmission among sex workers and their clients in high‐income countries 
Behavioural interventions, such as individual counselling, voluntary counselling and testing, peer education, negotiation skills for using a condom with their clients, assertiveness and relationship support, discussing attitudes and beliefs, videos and role‐playing, may reduce the prevalence of sexually transmitted infections (STI ) and improve the knowledge of HIV transmission among sex workers and their clients. 
Further randomised controlled trials that test for the identification of effective interventions for HIV prevention with outcomes of biological endpoints, such as HIV incidence or prevalence, are needed for these neglected populations. More research is also needed for male or transgender sex workers and their clients in high‐income countries.
