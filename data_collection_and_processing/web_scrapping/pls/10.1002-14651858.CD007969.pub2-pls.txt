Comparison of a light‐emitting diode with conventional light sources for providing phototherapy to jaundiced newborn infants 
Jaundice, or yellowish discolouration of the skin, can occur due to increased amounts of bilirubin pigment in the blood. It is a commonly observed, usually harmless condition in newborn infants during the first week after birth. However, in some babies the amount of bilirubin pigment can increase to dangerous levels and require treatment. Treatment of jaundice in newborn infants is done by placing them under phototherapy, a process of exposing their skin to light of a specific wavelength band. Fluorescent tubes or halogen lamps have been used as light sources for phototherapy for many years. A light‐emitting diode (LED) is a newer type of light source which is power efficient, has a longer life and is portable with low heat production. In this systematic review, the efficacy of LED phototherapy was compared with conventional (non‐LED) phototherapy. LED phototherapy was observed to be efficacious in bringing down the levels of serum total bilirubin, at rates similar to phototherapy with conventional light sources.
