Interventions to delay progression of Huntington's disease
HuntingtonÂ´s disease (HD) is an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disease for which no cure is currently available. We proposed to assess the effectiveness of interventions aimed at modifying disease progression and evaluate the methodological quality of the corresponding clinical trials. We selected eight trials comprising a total of 1366 participants. The results show that no intervention demonstrated an effect in modifying disease progression in HD.
