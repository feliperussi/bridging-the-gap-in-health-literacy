Postnatal thyroid hormones for respiratory distress syndrome in preterm infants
In preterm infants with breathing problems after birth, there is no evidence that thyroid hormone treatment given immediately after delivery reduces the severity of breathing difficulties or improves outcomes. Infants born prematurely are at risk of breathing problems due to lack of surfactant production by the lungs in the first days after birth. In animal research, thyroid hormones given before birth stimulate surfactant production and reduce the incidence and severity of breathing problems. This review found two small trials that compared the use of thyroid hormones to no treatment in infants with breathing problems in the first hours after birth. No benefit was found from use of these hormones on severity of breathing problems or complications that occurred as a result of these breathing problems. The effect on longer term development was not reported.
