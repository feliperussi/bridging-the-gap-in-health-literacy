Puerarin for acute ischaemic stroke
Review question 
To assess the effects of puerarin in people with ischaemic stroke.
Background 
Stroke is a common cause of death and serious disability. Puerarin, a type of Chinese traditional medicine extracted from the root of Pueraria lobata (Willd.), commonly known as kudzu, is widely used in the treatment of acute ischaemic stroke in China. Previous studies implied potent antioxidation properties and neural protective effects, but whether current evidence provides support for recommending puerarin for routine use is still uncertain. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for trials up to August 2015 and included 20 randomised controlled trials involving 1574 participants, of puerarin for people with ischaemic stroke. Only two trials reported death or dependency at the end of follow‐up. The remaining studies followed participants for less than one month. 
Key results 
We included 20 RCTs with 1574 participants in this updated review; five trials were new. Treatment with puerarin did not reduce death or dependency at final follow‐up. Puerain improved neurological deficit at the end of treatment. The included trials did not report serious adverse effects. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of evidence was low due to incomplete reporting of the methods and short‐term follow‐up.
