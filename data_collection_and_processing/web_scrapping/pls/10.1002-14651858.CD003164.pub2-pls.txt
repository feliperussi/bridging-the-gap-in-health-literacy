Location of rehabilitation services for the elderly
For a number of reasons, there has been an increased interest in providing elderly people with appropriate rehabilitation services.  Not only are there more elderly people, but the importance of ‘rehab’ after a stroke, hip fracture, or an illness in general, has been recognised.  With this, is the increasing pressure to use health care resources efficiently, ensure hospital beds are available to people who need acute hospital care and that rehab facilities and community services are in place.  
To ensure that elderly people can receive rehabilitation services, different ways of providing rehab have been developed.  An important difference in the services is where the rehab takes place.  Some services take place in care home environments, such as nursing homes, residential care homes and nursing facilities, while other services can take place in the hospital or at home.    
To determine and compare the effects of the different places for rehab on elderly people, a review was conducted.  After searching for all possible relevant studies, no studies were found.  Studies are needed.
