Continuous versus intermittent beta‐agonists for acute asthma
During acute asthma attacks, inhaled beta‐agonists (reliever medications) are used to treat spasm in the airways in the lungs. The medication can be administered by wet nebulisation or from an inhaler with a holding chamber; wet nebulisation may be delivered in a continuous or intermittent fashion. This review has collected information from randomised controlled trials comparing continuous to intermittent nebulised delivery methods in acute asthma attacks. Overall, differences were found between the two methods, with continuous nebulisers producing a modest reduction in admissions compared to intermittent beta‐agonist therapy. This finding was especially pronounced in severe acute asthma. Continuous nebuliser therapy may be more effective than intermittent nebulisers for delivering beta‐agonist drugs to relieve airway spasm in selected asthma populations.
