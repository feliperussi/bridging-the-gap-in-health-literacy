Antibiotic prophylaxis for transrectal prostate biopsy
Prostate cancer is the second most commonly diagnosed cancer in men and transrectal prostate biopsy is the procedure to obtain tissue for the histological diagnosis of carcinoma of the prostate. Despite the fact that infective complications after transrectal prostate biopsy are well known, there is uncertainty about the necessity and effectiveness of routine prophylactic antibiotics and a clear lack of standardization in antibiotic prophylaxis for transrectal prostate biopsy. In nine trials we observed that antibiotic prophylaxis is effective in preventing infectious complications (bacteriuria, bacteremia, fever, urinary tract infection, sepsis) and hospitalization following prostate biopsy. Several classes of antibiotics are effective for prophylaxis in prostate biopsy, with the quinolones the best analysed class. There are no definitive data to confirm that antibiotic for long‐course is superior to short‐course treatment, or that multiple‐dose treatment is superior to single‐dose treatment.
