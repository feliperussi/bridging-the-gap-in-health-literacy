Effect of taurine supplementation on growth and development in preterm or low birth weight infants 
Taurine is an amino acid that helps infants absorb fat from the gastrointestinal tract and ensures that the liver deals with waste products efficiently. Taurine may also have important roles in protecting nerves from damage, especially in the eyes and ears. This review sought evidence that supplementing the diet of preterm and low birth weight infants with taurine improves their growth and development. Nine small trials were found, but these did not provide any evidence that providing extra taurine improved outcomes. However, further trials of taurine supplementation are not likely to take place since taurine is naturally present in breast milk and current standard practice is to add taurine to formula milk and to intravenous nutrition solutions for feeding preterm and low birth weight infants.
