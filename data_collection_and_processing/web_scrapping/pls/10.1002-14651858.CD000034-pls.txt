Bed rest in hospital for suspected impaired fetal growth
Too little evidence from trials to show whether hospital bed rest for pregnant women has a beneficial effect on the unborn baby's growth. 
An unborn baby receiving too few nutrients can grow more slowly than expected in the womb (impaired fetal growth). Bed rest is sometimes suggested to mothers of these babies with the view that less maternal physical activity could result in more nutrients for the baby. However, bed rest can be disruptive and there are concerns about an increased risk of maternal blood clotting. This review of one study, involving 107 women, found too little evidence to show whether hospital bed rest for pregnant women is beneficial to the unborn baby. More research is needed into the effects on women and their babies.
