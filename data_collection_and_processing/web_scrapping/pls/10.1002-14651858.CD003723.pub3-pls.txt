Anticonvulsant therapy for status epilepticus
Some patients develop abnormal excessive electrical activity of brain nerve cells. This is called seizure activity and may involve a small area of the brain or the whole brain, resulting in sudden dysfunction of the structures involved, such as shaking of the limbs. The seizure activity often results in jerky movements (convulsions) and usually lasts a few minutes. When there is either more than 30 minutes of continuous seizure activity; or there are two or more seizures in a row without recovery of full consciousness between two seizures, the condition is called status epilepticus, which is a medical emergency. Many drugs have been studied in the management of this condition. This review found that intravenous (injected into a vein) lorazepam is better than diazepam or phenytoin for immediate control of status epilepticus. In the treatment of serially occurring seizures, diazepam gel administered rectally is effective in controlling seizures. Intravenous lorazepam is better than intravenous diazepam or phenytoin for immediate control of status epilepticus. For pre‚Äêhospital treatment, intramuscular midazolam is as effective as (probably more effective than) intravenous lorazepam in control of seizures and frequency of hospitalisation or intensive care admissions. There is a need to conduct more studies on other drugs routinely used for this condition.
