Psychological interventions for children with asthma
It is thought that psychological factors may play an important part in asthma, although this could not be determined in a previous review of psychological interventions in adults with asthma. Although there were twelve studies in this review that met inclusion criteria, the studies were small and study quality was poor. One finding did indicate that psychological interventions led to an improvement in peak flow. However, this finding would require confirmation in additional studies of better quality. No endorsement of psychological interventions can be made on the basis of the current literature.
