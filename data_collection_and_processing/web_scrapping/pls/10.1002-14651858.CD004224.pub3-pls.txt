Planned elective repeat caesarean section versus planned vaginal birth for women with a previous caesarean birth 
When a woman has had a previous caesarean birth, there are two options for her care in a subsequent pregnancy: planned elective repeat caesarean or planned vaginal birth. Both forms of care have benefits and risks associated with them. There were two small trials available but there are limited data to help women, their partners and their caregivers make this choice.
