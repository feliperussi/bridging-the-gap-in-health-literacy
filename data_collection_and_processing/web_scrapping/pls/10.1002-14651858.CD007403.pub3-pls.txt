Topical rubefacients for acute and chronic musculoskeletal pain in adults
This is an update of a review of rubefacients for acute and chronic pain, originally published in 2009, that includes one new study. 
A topical medication is a one that is applied to body surfaces such as the skin to treat ailments. Topical products might be creams, foams, gels, lotions, and ointments. Topical products can include a large range of medicines. 
Rubefacients are drugs that cause irritation and reddening of the skin due to increased blood flow. They are believed to relieve pain in various musculoskeletal conditions and are available on prescription and in over‐the‐counter remedies. Salicylate is a commonly used rubefacient. 
This review looked for evidence about the usefulness of topical rubefacients containing salicylate from randomised and double‐blind studies. These studies were in people with acute painful conditions like strains and sprains, or chronic painful conditions like osteoarthritis. We wanted to know whether topical salicylate‐containing rubefacients helped with the pain. 
Evidence for topical salicylate–containing rubefacients is limited by the quality, validity, and size of the available studies. For both acute and chronic painful conditions any evidence of efficacy came from the older, smaller studies, while the larger, more recent studies showed no effect. There is no good evidence that topical salicylate‐containing rubefacients give useful pain relief.
