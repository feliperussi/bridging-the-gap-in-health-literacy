Single dose lornoxicam (trade names Xefo, Xafon, Lorcam, Acabel) for acute postoperative pain in adults 
Lornoxicam is a non‐steroidal anti‐inflammatory drug (NSAID) that is used as a painkiller (analgesic). A high level of pain relief is experienced by about 45% of those with moderate to severe postoperative dental pain after a single dose of lornoxicam 8 mg, compared to about 10% with placebo. This is comparable to the proportion experiencing the same level of pain relief with ibuprofen 200 to 400 mg. Adverse events were generally mild and did not differ from placebo in these singe dose studies. There were insufficient data to assess duration of action, but it is likely to be similar to ibuprofen 200 mg.
