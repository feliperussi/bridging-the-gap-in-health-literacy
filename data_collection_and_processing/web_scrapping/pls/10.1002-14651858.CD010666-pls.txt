Micronutrient supplementation for children with HIV infection
This review includes 11 trials that tested the effectiveness and safety of various micronutrient supplements in children with HIV infection in a diversity of settings. All except one trial were conducted in African children. The primary outcomes were mortality, morbidity, and HIV‐related hospitalisations, and secondary outcomes were HIV disease progession, measures of growth, and adverse effects of supplementation. 
The review found that vitamin A supplements are beneficial and safe, and halved mortality overall in an analysis of three trials in different African countries. Zinc appeared to be safe and reduced diarhoeal morbidity in one trial. Multiple micronutrient supplements reduced the duration of hospital admissions, and improved appetite and short‐term growth in poorly nourished hospitalised children. 
Further research is needed on single supplements other than vitamin A, and on the long‐term effects, optimal composition and dosing of multiple supplements.
