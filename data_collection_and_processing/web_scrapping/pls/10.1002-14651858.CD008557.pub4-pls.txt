Intravenous immunoglobulins for epilepsy
Background Epilepsy is a disorder where recurrent seizures are caused by abnormal electrical discharges in the brain. People with epilepsy may present with various types of immunological abnormalities. Most seizures can be controlled by antiepileptic drugs, but sometimes seizures develop which are resistant to these drugs. People may require other types of treatment, such as intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIg). IVIg is a sterile, purified blood product extracted from the plasma of blood donors. IVIg treatment may present a valuable approach and its efficacy has important implications for epilepsy management. 
This review assessed the efficacy of IVg as a treatment for the control of epilepsy. Only one study (61 participants) which compared the treatment efficacy of IVIg as an add‐on with a placebo add‐on in patients with drug‐resistant epilepsy was included. 
Results Results of the review suggest that there is no convincing evidence to support the use of IVIg as a treatment for epilepsy and further randomised controlled trials are needed. 
Certainty of the evidence The included study was rated at low to unclear risk of bias. Using GRADE methodology, the certainty of the evidence was rated as low. This means that the true effect may be substantially different from what was found. 
The evidence is current to 20 December 2018.
