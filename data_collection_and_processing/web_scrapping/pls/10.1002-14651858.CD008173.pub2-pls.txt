Prophylactic antibiotics to reduce morbidity and mortality in newborn infants with intercostal catheters 
There is no evidence to support or refute the use of preventive antibiotics in newborn babies with drainage tubes placed in the chest. Sick newborn babies occasionally need the insertion of a tube that is placed through the skin and into the lung space to drain air or fluid from around their lungs. Because this process involves breaching the skin barrier, there is a potential risk of infection. The group of babies most likely to need this procedure are also those that are most at risk of developing an infection during their stay in hospital. Preventive antibiotics are commonly used when there is a risk of infection, but they may have unwanted effects. The review authors found no evidence to support or refute the use of routine preventive antibiotics when intercostal catheters are inserted in newborn babies.
