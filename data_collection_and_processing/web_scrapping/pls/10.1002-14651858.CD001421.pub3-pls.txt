Interventions to prevent blood loss during the treatment of pre‐cancerous abnormalities in the cervix (cervical intraepithelial neoplasia). 
Surgery for pre‐cancerous cervix lesions (cervical intraepithelial neoplasia) often causes significant bleeding during surgery or within 14 days. This review found that good surgical technique can reduce immediate blood loss and bleeding can also be reduced by some drugs. Vasopressin reduces blood flow by constricting blood vessels. Tranexamic acid reduces blood loss after knife and laser cone biopsy. Stitches also reduce blood loss but can interfere with later visual examination of the cervix.
