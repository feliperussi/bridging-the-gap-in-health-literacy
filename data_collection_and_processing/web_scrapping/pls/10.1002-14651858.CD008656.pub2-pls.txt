Non‐pharmacological interventions for preventing secondary vascular events after stroke or transient attack 
Stroke is the second leading cause of adult death worldwide. There is increasing evidence that individuals who have suffered a stroke can significantly benefit from organized stroke care during their period of recovery. Non‐pharmacological interventions (treatments that do not involve drugs) may play a role in preventing a secondary vascular event and reducing vascular risk factors. Only one randomized controlled trial was identified, involving 48 participants. Considering the small sample size and methodological limitation, no implications on the effectiveness of non‐pharmacological interventions post‐stroke can be drawn. Several ongoing trials will, in time, contribute to the current body of evidence. However, more research is needed.
