Does treating obstructive sleep apnoea in children who also have chronic cough improve their cough? 
Sleep apnoea (a condition where breathing stops for short spells during sleep) and chronic cough in children are significant medical problems and cause a significant burden of distress to parents. Interventions for sleep apnoea are associated with risks of morbidity and mortality, in addition to substantial costs. This review aimed to examine the effect of the treatment of sleep apnoea in children with chronic cough, however no randomised controlled trials were found. Currently there is no evidence to support the use of interventions for sleep apnoea in children with chronic cough and a randomised controlled trial is needed.
