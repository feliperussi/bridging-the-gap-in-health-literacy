Psychosocial smoking cessation interventions help patients with heart attacks to quit.
Smoking is a risk factor for heart attacks and stopping smoking is recommended for patients after a heart attack. Psychosocial smoking cessation interventions like counseling can help such patients to stop smoking, if they are provided for over one month. Psychosocial interventions can help such patients to quit within 6 months but studies about the long term effects did not support the beneficial short‚Äêterm findings. Most trials used a mixture of different intervention strategies, therefore no single strategy showed superior efficacy.
