Adhesives for fixed orthodontic brackets
Background 
It is useful for a clinician to know the best adhesive for fixing orthodontic brackets, so they do not fail during treatment. Bracket failure increases the time spent in surgery for repairs and the overall treatment time. At present orthodontics can choose between four groups of adhesives which may be set with a chemical reaction or curing light. Some adhesives may prevent early decay around brackets because they contain fluoride. 
Study characteristics 
The evidence in this review, which was carried out together with Cochrane Oral Health, is up‐to‐date as of 26 September 2017. We included three studies: a chemical cured composite was compared with a light cured composite (one trial), a conventional glass ionomer cement (one trial), and a polyacid‐modified resin composite (compomer) (one trial). The quality of the trial reports was generally poor. 
Key results 
There is no clear evidence on which to make a clinical decision of the type of orthodontic adhesive to use.
