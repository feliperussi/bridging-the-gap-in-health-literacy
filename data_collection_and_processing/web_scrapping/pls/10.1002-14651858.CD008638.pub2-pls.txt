SmartCare™ versus non‐automated weaning strategies for weaning time in invasively ventilated critically ill adults 
The process of discontinuing mechanical ventilation is known as weaning. During weaning, the work of breathing is transferred from the ventilator to the patient. Weaning is typically achieved by clinicians reducing ventilator support and/or conducting tests to determine whether a patient can breathe on his/her own. SmartCare™ is a unique system that automates this process by measuring selected respiratory variables, adapting ventilator output to meet individual patient needs and automatically conducting tests of spontaneous breathing to determine the earliest time when patients can breathe on their own. 
We identified 10 trials of moderate quality involving 654 participants and comparing SmartCare™ versus non‐automated weaning strategies. Compared with non‐automated strategies, SmartCare™ significantly decreased weaning time, time to successful removal from breathing machines and time spent in the ICU, with fewer patients receiving breathing machine support for longer than seven days and 21 days, and no increase in adverse events. SmartCare™ also showed a favourable trend toward fewer patients receiving ventilation for longer than 14 days, with no increase in adverse events. Subgroup analyses suggested more beneficial effects on weaning time in trials comparing SmartCare™ to a protocolized weaning strategy versus a non‐protocolized control strategy. Sensitivity analyses, which excluded two trials with high risk of bias, supported significant reductions in weaning time with SmartCare™.
