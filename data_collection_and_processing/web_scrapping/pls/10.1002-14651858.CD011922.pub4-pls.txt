Treatment of epilepsy for people with Alzheimer's disease
BackgroundAlzheimer's disease is a risk factor for increased seizures in older people. Seizures of any type can be observed in Alzheimer's disease and are probably underestimated. 
Study characteristicsWe searched scientific databases for clinical trials comparing medication and non‐medication‐based treatments for epilepsy in people with Alzheimer's disease. We wanted to evaluate how well the treatment worked and if it had any side effects. 
Key resultsWe included and analyzed one randomized controlled trial (a clinical study where people are randomly put into one or two (or more) treatment groups) with 95 participants. Concerning the proportion of participants with freedom from seizures, no significant differences were found between the antiepileptic drugs (levetiracetam versus lamotrigine, levetiracetam versus phenobarbital, and lamotrigine versus phenobarbital). It seemed that levetiracetam could improve cognition (thinking) and lamotrigine could relieve depression, while phenobarbital and lamotrigine could worsen cognition, and levetiracetam and phenobarbital could worsen mood. 
Certainty of the evidenceThe certainty of the evidence for all the outcomes from the study were very low. This means that we are very uncertain about the results and they should be interpreted with caution. Large randomized controlled trials are required to determine how effective and well tolerated treatments are for epilepsy in people with Alzheimer's disease. 
The evidence is current to August 2020.
