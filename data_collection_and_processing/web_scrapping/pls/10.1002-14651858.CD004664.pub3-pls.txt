Vibroacoustic stimulation for fetal assessment in labour in the presence of a nonreassuring fetal heart rate trace 
Vibratory and sound stimulation may help to tell how well a baby is during labour when the heart beat is showing possible concerns. 
A baby's heart rate is checked during labour to try to identify babies who are having difficulties. However, changes in the baby's heart‐rate patterns may not always mean the baby really is having difficulties. When the heart‐rate pattern is not reassuring, extra tests may help to indicate which babies need help. Sound and vibratory stimulation (fetal vibroacoustic stimulation) is one such test. For healthy babies it produces a positive response, and absence of this could be a sign that the baby is having difficulty. The review authors found no randomised trials that considered vibroacoustic stimulation for this use. More research would be helpful.
