Diuretics acting on the distal renal tubule for preterm infants with (or developing) chronic lung disease 
There is no strong evidence of benefit from routine use of distal diuretics in preterm infants with chronic lung disease. Lung disease in infants born early (preterm) is often complicated with excess of water. Medications that reduce body water (diuretics) might help the infant recover from lung disease. The review of trials analysed the effects of diuretics working on the end of the small kidney tubes (distal diuretics). It found that diuretic treatment for four weeks improved lung function. Only one study showed long term benefit (decreased rates of death and artificial ventilation). However, the infants in these trials did not receive all the medications that are currently available.
