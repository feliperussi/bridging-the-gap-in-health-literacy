Prophylactic doxapram for the prevention of morbidity and mortality in preterm infants undergoing endotracheal extubation 
Doxapram has not been shown to improve outcomes for babies being weaned off mechanical breathing support.When preterm babies have been on mechanical breathing support in neonatal intensive care, it can be hard to wean them off the machine (tracheal extubation). Using drugs called methylxanthines, or breathing support via the nose (nasal CPAP ‚Äê continuous positive airways pressure) can help. Doxapram stimulates breathing, and is another drug that is sometimes used around extubation. However, the review of trials found no evidence that doxapram can reduce problems for babies around extubation, and it may cause some adverse effects. Further research is needed.
