Levomepromazine for schizophrenia
Schizophrenia is a profoundly disabling mental illness affecting thoughts, emotions and behaviour. It has a life time prevalence of about 1%. Antipsychotic medications still remain as the mainstay of treatment for schizophrenia. Antipsychotic medications are classified into typical and atypical subtypes. First generation or typical antipsychotic medications have been the mainstay of treatment for schizophrenia for decades and have been effective in reducing the positive symptoms of schizophrenia, but negative symptoms have been fairly resistant to treatment. With the advent of atypical antipsychotics there has been a surge in prescriptions of the atypical antipsychotic medications in recent years. Levomepromazine is one among these 'older' typical antipsychotic medications. We systematically reviewed the effects of levomepromazine in comparison to other typical and atypical antipsychotic medications for people with schizophrenia and schizophrenia‚Äêlike disorders. We were able to include four studies in our systematic review.
