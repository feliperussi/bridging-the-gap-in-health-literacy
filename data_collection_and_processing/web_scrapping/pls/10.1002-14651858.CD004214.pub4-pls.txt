Transfer of preterm infants from incubator to open cot at lower versus higher body weight 
For preterm infants to be discharged home from nurseries, they must be able to maintain their temperature in an unheated open cot. The timing of the transfer from the incubator is important because, if an infant is not able to maintain his/her temperature and is cold, then this could affect weight gain and delay the infant's discharge from hospital. A review of the trials found that preterm infants can be transferred to unheated open cots at a lower body weight of 1600 grams without adverse effects on temperature stability or weight gain.
