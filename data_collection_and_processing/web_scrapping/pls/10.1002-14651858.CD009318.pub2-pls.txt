Lacosamide for neuropathic pain and fibromyalgia in adults
Antiepileptic drugs like lacosamide are commonly used for treating neuropathic pain, usually defined as pain due to damage to nerves. This would include postherpetic neuralgia (persistent pain experienced in an area previously affected by shingles), painful diabetic neuropathy, nerve injury pain, phantom limb pain and trigeminal neuralgia; fibromyalgia also responds to some antiepileptic drugs. This type of pain can be severe and long‐lasting, is associated with lack of sleep, fatigue, depression and a reduced quality of life. This review included five studies in painful diabetic neuropathy (1863 participants) and one in fibromyalgia (159 participants). In people with painful diabetic neuropathy, lacosamide had only a modest effect, with a specific effect due to its use in 1 person in 10. This is a minor effect and may be an over‐estimate due to use of the last observation carried forward method for analysis. There was insufficient information in fibromyalgia to draw any conclusions about the effect of lacosamide. There was no significant difference between lacosamide and placebo for participants with any, or a serious, adverse event, but there were significantly more adverse event withdrawals with lacosamide. Regulatory authorities have not licensed lacosamide for treating pain based on evidence presently available.
