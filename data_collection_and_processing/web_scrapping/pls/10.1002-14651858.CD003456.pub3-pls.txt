Drug therapy for chronic idiopathic axonal polyneuropathy
What is the aim of this review? 
The aim of this Cochrane Review was to assess the benefits and harms of drug therapy for chronic idiopathic axonal polyneuropathy (CIAP). 
Cochrane Review authors collected and aimed to analyse all relevant studies to answer this question. This is the most recent update of a review first published in 2004. 
Key messages 
There have not been any randomised trials of drug therapy for CIAP. Future trials will need sensitive outcome measures and long follow‐up periods. 
What was studied in the review? 
CIAP is a frequent disorder in elderly people that can reduce quality of life. Typically, the feet, lower legs and sometimes the hands slowly become numb or weak. The need for evidence‐based treatments is increasing as the number of people affected is likely to rise in ageing populations. By definition, the cause of CIAP is unknown. 
What are the main results of the review? 
We found no trials suitable for review.
How up to date is this review? 
The evidence is up to date to July 2016.
