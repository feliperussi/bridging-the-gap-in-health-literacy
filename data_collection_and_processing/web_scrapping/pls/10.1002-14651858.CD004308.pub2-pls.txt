Indometacin in use as a single dose for treating acute postoperative pain
Indometacin is a non‐steroidal anti‐inflammatory drug (NSAID) used for treating postoperative pain. This review found only one small study of women with post‐episiotomy pain where the effectiveness of the drug (taken by mouth) was compared with a placebo. Conclusions about the effectiveness of orally administered indometacin cannot be made until more studies are undertaken.
