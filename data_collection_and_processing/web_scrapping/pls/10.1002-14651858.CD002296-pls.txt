Medications to prevent NSAID‐induced gastroduodenal ulcers
The results of this meta‐analysis demonstrate that misoprostol, proton pump inhibitors, and double doses of H2‐receptor antagonists are effective at reducing the risk of both gastric and duodenal non steroidal anti‐inflammatory (NSAID) medications induced ulcers. In high risk patients, the use of a traditional NSAID + PPI appears equivalent to a COX‐2 inhibitor alone. The most effective strategy in high risk GI patients appears to be the combination of a COX‐2 inhibitor + PPI.
