Prostaglandins for preventing postpartum haemorrhage
An injectable uterotonic is the drug of choice for routine third stage management when the placenta is delivered. Oral or sublingual misoprostol may be used where no injectable uterotonic is available. 
After her baby is born, the woman's womb (uterus) contracts and bleeding decreases. If the womb does not contract, postpartum haemorrhage (heavy bleeding) can occur, which can be life threatening. A prostaglandin, oxytocin and ergometrine are all drugs that cause contractions of the womb (uterotonics). This review of 72 randomised controlled trials, involving 52,678 women, found that oral or sublingual prostaglandin (misoprostol) is effective in reducing severe haemorrhage after giving birth and the need for blood transfusions. Misoprostol is not as effective as oxytocin and has more side‐effects. The main side‐effects are shivering, high temperature and diarrhoea, occurring in a significant proportion of women. Twenty‐six of the trials included centres in low‐ and middle‐income countries only. Misoprostol may be useful in places where injectable uterotonics are not available, perhaps because of poor access to skilled healthcare providers. Injectable prostaglandin may be effective in reducing blood loss but has adverse effects of vomiting, abdominal pain and diarrhoea and costs more.
