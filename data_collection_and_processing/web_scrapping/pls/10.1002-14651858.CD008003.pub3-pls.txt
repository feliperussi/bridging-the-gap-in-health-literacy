Interventions for the management of external root resorption
Review question 
This review has been conducted to assess different interventions for managing the reabsorption of the tooth root. 
Background 
External root resorption is when the body’s own immune system dissolves the tooth root structure. It can occur following tooth infection, orthodontic treatments or in the presence of unerupted teeth in the jaw. Although this condition does not usually produce symptoms, external root resorption may result in movement of the tooth and, if not diagnosed and treated at an early stage, might eventually result in the tooth falling out. Despite this condition being quite common, treatment is generally on a case‐by‐case basis and there is a lack of evidence regarding the best treatments. 
Study characteristics 
Authors from the Cochrane Oral Health Group carried out this review of existing studies, and the evidence is current up to 14 October 2015. There were no studies found that met the inclusion criteria for this review. 
Key results and quality of the evidence 
This review revealed that there is no evidence for the effectiveness of available treatments and there is therefore a need for further research to help clinicians and patients to make informed choices about treatment options.
