Treatments that suppress the immune system for neuropathy caused by non‐systemic vasculitis (inflammation of blood vessels limited to those supplying the peripheral nerves) 
Non‐systemic vasculitic neuropathy ('isolated vasculitic neuropathy') is a rare disease causing progressive, disabling, painful loss of sensation with muscle weakness in arms and legs that is often asymmetrical. The diagnosis is made through the finding of inflammation of blood vessels confined to nerve or muscle tissue, or both, and by excluding other conditions that could be the cause, such as systemic vasculitis (inflammation of blood vessels affecting multiple organs in the body), rheumatic diseases, or any other cause for the neuropathy. This is an updated review. No randomised controlled clinical trials have been performed on which to base immunosuppressive treatment for non‐systemic vasculitic neuropathy. Blinded randomised trials of adding other immunosuppressive agents to corticosteroids are needed. Such trials will need sufficiently long follow‐up periods to evaluate treatment efficacy with disability outcome measures designed and validated for assessing change in immune‐mediated inflammatory neuropathies.
