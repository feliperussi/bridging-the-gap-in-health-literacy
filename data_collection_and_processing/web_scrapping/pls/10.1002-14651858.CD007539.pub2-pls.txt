Pre‐transfusion drugs for preventing side effects from blood transfusions 
Febrile non‐haemolytic transfusion reactions (FNHTRs) and allergic reactions are the most common adverse reactions to blood transfusion. These reactions are often related to other dangerous side effects from transfusion such as sepsis due to contaminated blood products and intravascular red cell haemolysis. 
In an effort to prevent these reactions, patients are given drugs prior to transfusion. Three kinds of drugs are commonly used for this pre‐transfusion medication, either alone or in combination. However, this practice is not standardised and there is controversy about its effectiveness. 
This review found that current evidence from three trials in which 462 patients were analysed indicates pre‐transfusion medication in any regimen does not reduce the risk of allergic and febrile non‐haemolytic transfusion reactions.
