Preoperative vascular access evaluation for haemodialysis patients
Vascular access is required for people on haemodialysis to connect with the dialysis machine. Compared with other types of vascular access, there is wide acceptance that arteriovenous fistulas (fistulas) provide best outcomes for patients because there is less likelihood of infection and clotting. 
Fistulas can take a long time to mature enough to be used for dialysis and many fail. Mapping blood vessels using medical imaging techniques before a fistula operation may help surgeons plan the best fistula location by selecting the best blood vessels to create the fistula. This may enhance the likelihood that the fistulas will mature and stay open and available for dialysis use ('patency'). 
For this review, we searched the literature published up to April 2015 and found four studies that involved 450 participants which met our inclusion criteria. The included studies compared the proportions of fistulas that matured when evaluation was carried out before surgery using medical imaging techniques with standard care (no imaging). 
Our analysis found that vessel imaging before surgery did not improve the rate of fistulas that matured. Further research in this area involving more participants may be beneficial to better understand if imaging before surgery could help to increase the success of fistulas for people who need haemodialysis.
