Use of wound drains after caesarean section
Women who have a caesarean section operation (removing the baby by surgery through the mother's abdomen) sometimes have a wound drain put in place. A surgical drain is a tube used to remove pus, blood or other fluids from a wound. The review did not find any differences in the risk of wound infection or other post operative complications between women who had wound drains compared with those who did not.
