Is sodium bicarbonate therapy helpful for people with acute kidney problems?
Acute kidney damage is a common problem that is often found in people who need treatment for problems not related to kidney health. Failing kidney health often causes more acid than normal in the blood (acidosis), which in itself is thought to cause harm. 
It has been suggested that a treatment strategy for patients with acidosis is to give alkaline solutions to counteract or neutralise effects of the acid. Sodium bicarbonate is the alkaline solution normally used. 
We searched the medical literature for evidence about the benefits or harms of giving sodium bicarbonate to people whose kidneys are failing. We did not find any randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that assessed the benefits or harms of giving sodium bicarbonate to people with acute kidney problems. 
Therefore, we cannot recommend or dismiss the use of sodium bicarbonate for people with kidney problems. We recommend that RCTs are conducted to answer this question.
