Anticoagulation for cerebral venous sinus thrombosis
Blood thinning (anticoagulant) drugs may be beneficial for patients with clotting of the veins that surround the brain (sinus thrombosis). Sinus thrombosis is a rare condition where blood clots form in the veins that drain blood from the brain. However, anticoagulant drugs, which are often used to treat sinus thrombosis, carry a risk of bleeding. We only found two small trials involving 79 patients; the results of the review suggested that anticoagulant drugs are probably safe and may be beneficial for people with sinus thrombosis but these results are not conclusive.
