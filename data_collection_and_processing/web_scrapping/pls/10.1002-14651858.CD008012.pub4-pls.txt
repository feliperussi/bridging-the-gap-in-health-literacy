Treatments for depression in individuals with coronary artery disease
This review examined clinical trials on psychological treatments and antidepressant drugs in individuals with coronary artery disease and depression. The objective was to determine the effects of these treatments on depression, mortality, cardiac events such as another heart attack, or heart surgery. 
We identified 37 trials as relevant for the review. Fifteen trials investigated psychological treatments, and 21 trials investigated pharmacological interventions including antidepressant drugs. 
Generally, psychological treatments compared to controls, and antidepressant drugs compared to placebo (inactive drug), may result in a reduction in depression symptoms at the end of treatment; however, the evidence is generally of low certainty. The evidence is very uncertain as to whether psychological treatments compared to control and antidepressant drugs compared to placebo reduce mortality and cardiovascular events. 
The evidence is current to August 2020.
