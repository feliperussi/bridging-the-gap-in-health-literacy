Interventions in the workplace to support breastfeeding for women in employment
No trials to say if specific programs in the workplace help to increase the duration of breastfeeding. 
Breastfeeding is beneficial for mothers and their infants. However, working mothers may return to work early after giving birth for various reasons. If not supported by their employers, they can be separated from their babies, have difficulty expressing and storing milk and thus not be able to maintain breastfeeding. Workplace programs could help women to continue to breastfeed, and some programs may help women to initiate breastfeeding. By promoting and supporting the programs, employers may be able to influence the duration of breastfeeding (including exclusive breastfeeding) and so improve the health of mother and baby, but also benefit from less work absenteeism, high productivity and increased employee morale and retention. This review aimed to assess workplace programs to promote breastfeeding among employed women returning to work after the birth of their child. There were no randomised controlled trials identified that evaluated this important public health intervention in a workplace. Trials are needed to establish the impact of workplace interventions (including creches and nurseries) to support or facilitate continuation, duration and exclusiveness of breastfeeding for employed women returning to work after giving birth.
