Pharmacological interventions for the acute management of hyperkalaemia in adults
Hyperkalaemia is a serious medical problem that may cause heart problems or death. There are several treatments that can be used to treat hyperkalaemia but the risks and benefits of each intervention are poorly understood. We performed this review to determine whether treatments for hyperkalaemia are effective and safe 
We searched for all studies that tested whether therapies were effective and safe at treating high potassium published up to 18 August 2015. We found seven studies that investigated drug therapies for treating hyperkalaemia in adults which together included results from 241 participants. Most studies tested the therapies in male and female adults with kidney problems who were medically stable. We did not find any studies that looked at the serious medical complications of high potassium such as death. 
We found that salbutamol and insulin‚Äêdextrose were effective in reducing potassium levels in the blood. We found that salbutamol was effective whether it was given intravenously or by nebuliser. Those treatments appeared to be more effective than other treatments such as sodium bicarbonate and aminophylline. None of the studies found any serious adverse reactions to the medications. 
Overall, the quality of evidence was assessed as poor because the studies were small in size and the methods for how the studies were performed were not well described. None of the studies looked at the serious problems caused by hyperkalaemia and this limited the strength of the evidence.
