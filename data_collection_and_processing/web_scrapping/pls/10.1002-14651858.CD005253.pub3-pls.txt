Iodine supplementation for the prevention of mortality and adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes in preterm infants 
Review question: Does giving preterm infants iodine supplements reduce their risk of dying or improve their brain development? 
Background: Infants born preterm (several weeks early) may not receive the recommended amounts of iodine in their diet, as both preterm human breast milk and nutrition given via a drip in hospitals do not contain enough iodine to meet their heightened needs. Deficiency of iodine may affect the production of thyroid hormones that are important for brain and lung development in newborn infants. Given concerns that iodine deficiency may be harmful, we reviewed all the available evidence from clinical trials that assessed the effects of giving preterm infants iodine supplements. 
Study characteristics: The evidence is up to date as of February 2018. We found two relevant trials (including 1394 infants). Both trials used reliable methods to ensure that their findings were not biased. 
Key results: Analysis of data from these trials showed that iodine supplements for preterm infants does not affect the chances of dying or improve longer‚Äêterm brain development. This evidence was highly reliable. 
Conclusions: The currently available evidence indicates that routine supplemental iodine does not have important benefits for preterm infants.
