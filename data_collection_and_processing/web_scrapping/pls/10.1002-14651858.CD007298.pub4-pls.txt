The use of regular vitamin D preparations for children and adults with cystic fibrosis
Cystic fibrosis with pancreatic insufficiency can mean that fat‚Äêsoluble vitamins, such as vitamin D, are poorly absorbed. This can lead to vitamin deficiencies. Lack of vitamin D (vitamin D deficiency) can cause specific problems such as bone deformity and bone fractures. It may also be associated with poorer general and respiratory health. Therefore, people with cystic fibrosis are usually given regular vitamin D preparations from a very young age. However, excess vitamin D can also cause respiratory problems and problems with high calcium levels. The review contains six studies, however we could only analyse data from three of these studies. Three studies were only published as conference abstracts. 
The included studies varied greatly in quality, the amount of vitamin D administered, the duration of treatment and the outcomes that were measured. Three studies were in children and adolescents and three in adults. Few outcome data could be combined. The sole outcome that included data from two or more studies was vitamin D levels. Our analysis showed increased vitamin D levels in people who were given vitamin D supplements. For other outcomes, we found no evidence to show whether giving vitamin D regularly to people with cystic fibrosis is beneficial or not. We are unable to draw any conclusions about giving routine vitamin D supplements and recommend that, until more evidence is available, local guidelines are followed regarding this practice.
