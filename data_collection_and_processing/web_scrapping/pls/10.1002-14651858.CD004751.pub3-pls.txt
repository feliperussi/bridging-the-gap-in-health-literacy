Laparoscopic surgery for benign ovarian tumours is associated with less pain, shorter hospital stay, and fewer adverse events than with laparotomy 
Laparoscopy is a modern surgical technique in which operations are performed through small incisions (usually 2 to 3 cm long) using a laparoscope. This is a telescopic rod lens system that is usually connected to a video camera. In the 12 controlled studies identified, laparoscopic surgery was associated with reduced risk of any adverse events from surgery, less pain, and fewer days in the hospital when compared to laparotomy, the traditional surgical technique.There was no difference between the procedures with regard to outcomes of fever, postoperative infections, and tumour recurrence.
