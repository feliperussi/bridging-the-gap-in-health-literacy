Colorectal (bowel) cancer is common worldwide but is especially prevalent in industrialised countries. Genes, diet and lifestyle all seem to be important in the development of bowel cancer. 
Experimental animals studies and observational studies have suggested that nonsteroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs and aspirin may reduce the development of colorectal cancer and recurrence of adenomas in patients with familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP). 
The review found some evidence to support the effectiveness of aspirin for reducing the risk of recurrent sporadic colorectal adenomas. Further, there is evidence from short‐term studies to support regression, but not elimination or prevention of colorectal adenomas in FAP with NSAIDs. The review suggests more research on the long‐term role of NSAIDs.
