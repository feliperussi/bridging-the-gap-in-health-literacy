Structured treatment interruptions (STI) in chronic suppressed HIV infection in adults
Structured treatment interruptions (STI) of antiretroviral therapy (ART) have been studied as an alternative strategy in the management of HIV‐infected patients. STI involve planned, pre‐specified cyclical interruptions in ART with an aim to alleviate treatment fatigue, provide possible immunological benefit, reduce drug toxicities and decrease costs of care. This systematic review aims to synthesize the evidence for use of STI as an alternative strategy in the management of chronic suppressed HIV infection. STI is a planned, experimental intervention, and the evidence from 33 available intervention trials has been summarized. Currently, several large STI trials are underway, investigating long‐term effects of STI strategies. Their results will be available in a few years. Based on the studies we reviewed, we find that there is insufficient evidence to support the use of STI as a standard of care in the management of chronic suppressed HIV infection.
