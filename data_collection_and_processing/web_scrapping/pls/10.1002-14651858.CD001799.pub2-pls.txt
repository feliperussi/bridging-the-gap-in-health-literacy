Preoperative radiotherapy for esophageal carcinoma (cancer of the gullet)
If the tumour has not spread, surgery is usually the standard treatment for cancer of the esophagus (the tube between the throat and stomach). Surgery to remove the cancer can help people to live longer, but the prognosis is still very poor. Trials have tried using radiotherapy (x‚Äêray treatment) before the operation. It was hoped that this would make the tumour smaller, less likely to spread and let people live longer. However, the review of trials found no clear evidence that radiotherapy before surgery for cancer of the esophagus increases a patient's chances of survival.
