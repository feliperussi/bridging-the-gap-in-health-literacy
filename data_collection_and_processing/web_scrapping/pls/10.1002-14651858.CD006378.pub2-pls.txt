Aspirin, steroid and non‐steroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs use for treating Alzheimer's disease 
Inflammation may play an important role in the development of Alzheimer’s disease. There is also some evidence from community surveys that people receiving anti‐inflammatory drugs for various medical conditions may be less likely to develop Alzheimer's disease. Fourteen studies met our inclusion criteria for this review and none of the exclusion criteria. Aspirin, steroid and non‐steroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (traditional and the selective cyclooxygenase‐2 (COX‐2) inhibitors) showed no significant benefit in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. Therefore, the use of these drugs cannot be recommended for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.
