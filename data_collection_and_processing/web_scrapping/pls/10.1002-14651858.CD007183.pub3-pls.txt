Interventions for treating HIV‐associated nephropathy
HIV‐associated nephropathy (HIVAN) is a kidney disease common among HIV positive patients, especially patients of African origin. The condition rapidly deteriorates if left untreated. Various treatment options exist, but the benefit of each is unknown. These include: antiretroviral therapy, steroids, angiotensin‐converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) and cyclosporin. The aim of this review was to determine the benefits and harms of each treatment option. No completed randomised control trials (RCT) of any interventions for HIVAN were found and so the effects of the treatment options could not be evaluated. However, the results of observational studies identified showed that steroids and ACEI were beneficial in improving the kidney functions of patients. We await the results of three ongoing studies, however more RCTs are needed.
