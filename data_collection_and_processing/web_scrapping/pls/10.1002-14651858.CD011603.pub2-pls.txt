Buprenorphine for neuropathic pain in adults
Neuropathic pain is pain coming from damaged nerves. It is different from pain messages that are carried along healthy nerves from damaged tissue (for example, a fall or cut, or arthritic knee). Neuropathic pain is often treated by different medicines (drugs) to those used for pain from damaged tissue, which we often think of as painkillers. Medicines that are sometimes used to treat depression or epilepsy can be very effective in some people with neuropathic pain. But sometimes opioid painkillers are used to treat neuropathic pain. 
Opioid painkillers are drugs like morphine. Morphine is derived from plants, but many opioids are also made by chemical synthesis rather than being extracted from plants. Buprenorphine is one of these synthetic opioids. It is available in numerous countries for use as a painkiller, and can be given by injection, as a tablet placed under the tongue, or as a patch that delivers the drug to the body through the skin. 
In June 2015, we performed searches to look for clinical trials where buprenorphine was used to treat neuropathic pain in adults. We found no study that did this, and that met our requirements for the review. 
There is no evidence to support or refute the suggestion that buprenorphine works in any neuropathic pain condition. Large, properly conducted new clinical trials would be needed to provide evidence that buprenorphine worked in neuropathic pain conditions.
