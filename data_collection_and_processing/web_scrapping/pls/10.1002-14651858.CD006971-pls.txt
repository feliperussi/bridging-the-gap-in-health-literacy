Intracervical prostaglandins for induction of labour
Prostaglandins inserted into the cervix are effective in starting labour, but are inferior to vaginal administration. 
Prostaglandins are produced naturally by the body during the process of labour. Their role is to prepare the cervix and to help open the cervix in response to contractions. When it is decided to induce labour and the cervix is not yet open, synthetic prostaglandins are used to ripen it before drugs that produce contractions (usually oxytocin) are given. One way to give prostaglandin is to insert it into the cervix, using a cannula during a vaginal examination. The review of fifty‚Äêsix trials (7738 women) found that although this route of administration is effective, it offers no advantages when compared to other methods of administration, namely the vaginal route.
