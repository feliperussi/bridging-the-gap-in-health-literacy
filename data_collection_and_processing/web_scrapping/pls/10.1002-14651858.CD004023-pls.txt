Early treatment for early stage multiple myeloma may slow the disease progression but does not appear to improve survival 
Multiple myeloma (MM) is cancer of the bone marrow. It causes bone destruction that leads to pain, spinal cord compression and fractures.In early stages, most people do not show any symptoms of MM. It is not clear whether it is better to start treatment with cancer drugs straight after diagnosis, or to wait until symptoms of the disease appear. The review of trials found that early treatment slows the progression of the disease. However, there is not enough evidence, due to too few studies conducted in patients with early stage myeloma to show that early treatment improves the survival of people with MM.
