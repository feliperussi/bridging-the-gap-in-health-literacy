The technique popularly known as 'liberation procedure' for treatment of venous stenoses (CCSVI) in the brain of people with MS 
What is the issue? Chronic cerebrospinal venous insufficiency (CCSVI) has been described as a vascular condition characterized by restricted venous outflow from the brain and spinal cord, mainly due to narrowing or blockage of the veins in the head and neck. It has been hypothesised that CCSVI may be an important factor in the development of MS and treatment of CCSVI by catheter venography and percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) to widen the veins might improve symptoms and quality of life in people with MS. There is uncertainty about whether PTA should be used in people with MS. 
What did we do? We reviewed three studies (238 participants) which compared PTA with sham‚ÄêPTA in participants with MS and CCSVI. 
What did we find? We found that venous PTA did not provide benefit on disability, physical or cognitive functions, relapses, or quality of life. No serious adverse events attributable to venography or venous PTA occurred. 
Conclusions Venous PTA has proven to be a safe but ineffective intervention and cannot be recommended in patients with MS. All trials that were ongoing were either terminated or withdrawn, so this updated review is conclusive. No further randomised clinical studies are needed. 
Currentness of evidence This review is up to date to August 2018.
