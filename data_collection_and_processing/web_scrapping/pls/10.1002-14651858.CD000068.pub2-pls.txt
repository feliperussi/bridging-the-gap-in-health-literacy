Danazol for pelvic pain associated with endometriosis
Danazol reduces the painful symptoms of endometriosis but has androgenic effects. Endometriosis is a painful condition where endometrial tissue grows outside the uterus. It can cause cysts and infertility. Danazol is a hormone that produces male characteristics as well as weight gain and acne. It does, however, relieve the painful symptoms of endometriosis, although the side effects can be unacceptable. The improvement was still present six months after treatment was stopped. There was some evidence that women who took danazol were satisfied with the treatment compared with women who had inactive treatment.
