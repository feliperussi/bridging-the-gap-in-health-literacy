Clofibrate for neonatal jaundice
Jaundice is a common problem in the neonatal period typically in the first week of life. It is treated quite effectively using phototherapy whereby the baby is placed under special lights for up to three to four days. Clofibrate is used in some countries in combination with phototherapy to reduce the time the baby needs to spend under lights thereby reducing parental anxiety and improved parent‚Äêbaby bonding opportunities. 
We have reviewed the evidence using systematic literature searches and have synthesised outcome data to see if clofibrate does has an effect on time spent under lights. We identified 12 studies and the use of clofibrate reduced time spent under lights by an average of 23 hours for both term and preterm babies. 
However, most of the studies were carried out in one country, Iran, so these findings may not be generalisable to other countries. 
Clofibrate has been withdrawn from the market in some countries and is no longer in use in adults (the primary indication) because of safety concerns. As such, we will no longer be updating this review.
