No strong evidence for any interventions for preventing infection in nephrotic syndrome
Patients with nephrotic syndrome, particularly children, are susceptible to infections. Infections can cause frequent relapses of illness, poor response to therapies (e.g. steroids) and severe infections occasionally lead to death. Oral antibiotics, pneumococcal vaccination, some immunomodulators and Chinese medicinal herbs have been used/recommended for reducing the risk of infection. No studies on antibiotics, pneumococcal vaccination and any other non‐drug prophylaxis were identified. This review found that intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), thymosin, oral transfer factor, Bacillus Calmette‐Guerin (BCG) vaccine injection and two kinds of Chinese medicinal herbs (Huangqi granules and TIAOJINING) may help prevent infections in nephrotic children. These studies were methodologically poor. Currently there is no strong evidence for recommending any interventions for preventing infections in nephrotic syndrome. More research is needed.
