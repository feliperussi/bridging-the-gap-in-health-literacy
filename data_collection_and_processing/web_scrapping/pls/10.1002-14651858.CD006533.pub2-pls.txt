Duloxetine versus other antidepressive agents for depression
Although pharmacological and psychological interventions are both effective for major depression, antidepressant drugs remain the mainstay of treatment in moderate to severe major depression. During the last 20 years, newer compounds (such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and dual action agents such as serotonin noradrenalin reuptake inhibitors) have progressively become the most commonly prescribed antidepressants. Duloxetine hydrochloride, one of the most recent antidepressants introduced in the market, is a selective serotonin noradrenergic reuptake inhibitor for oral administration. In the present review we assessed the evidence for the efficacy, acceptability and tolerability of duloxetine in comparison with all other antidepressants in the acute‐phase treatment of major depression. Sixteen randomised controlled trials (5735 participants) were included. Duloxetine was not more effective than some other new antidepressant agents in the acute‐phase treatment of major depression, and it was less well tolerated than escitalopram and venlafaxine as more patients allocated to duloxetine withdrew treatment before study end. However, due to the limited number of studies per comparison these results should be interpreted with caution.
