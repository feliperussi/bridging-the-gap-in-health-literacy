Dressings and topical agents to help surgical wounds heal by secondary intention
Most surgical incisions heal by primary intention, i.e. the edges of the surgical incision are closed together with stitches or clips until the cut edges merge. Healing by secondary intention refers to healing of an open wound, from the base upwards, by laying down new tissue. There are many kinds of dressings and topical agents available but few have been evaluated in trials. This review did not find any evidence that any one dressing or topical agent speeds up the healing of surgical wounds healing by secondary intention more than another, although gauze may be associated with greater pain or discomfort for the patient.
