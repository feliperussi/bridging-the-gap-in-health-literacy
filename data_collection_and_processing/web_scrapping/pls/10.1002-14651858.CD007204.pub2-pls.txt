No evidence that cannabinoids are effective in the improvement of disturbed behaviour in dementia or in the treatment of other symptoms of dementia 
Cannabinoids are compounds derived from the cannabis plant (Cannabis sativa). Laboratory studies have indicated that cannabinoids may regulate some of the processes that lead to neurodegeneration. This suggests that cannabinoids could be useful in the treatment of neurodegenerative dementias such as Alzheimer's disease. So far, only one small randomized controlled trial has assessed the efficacy of cannabinoids in the treatment of dementia. This study had poorly presented results and did not provide sufficient data to draw any useful conclusions.
