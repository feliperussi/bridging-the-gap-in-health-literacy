Quetiapine for schizophrenia
We looked for randomised controlled trials to determine the effects of quetiapine for schizophrenia in comparison to placebo and other antipsychotics. We included results of ten short‐term trials and two medium‐term studies. Quetiapine is effective for the treatment of schizophrenia but not much different from first‐generation antipsychotics and risperidone in the respects of treatment withdrawal and efficacy. In comparison to typical antipsychotics and risperidone, it has a lower risk of movement disorders but higher risks of dizziness, dry mouth and sleepiness.
