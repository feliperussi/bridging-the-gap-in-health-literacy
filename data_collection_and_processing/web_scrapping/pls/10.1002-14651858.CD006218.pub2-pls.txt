Influenza vaccine for children and adults with bronchiectasis
In many countries, influenza vaccination is an accepted part of routine immunisation recommendations particularly in persons 65 years and over, those in long‚Äêterm care facilities and also adults and children with chronic illnesses including those with bronchiectasis. In this review however, our search for randomised control trials examining the effectiveness of influenza vaccines for people with bronchiectasis revealed no relevant studies. In the absence of evidence, patients' needs should be individualised and national guidelines be adhered to.
