Treatment of epilepsy in people with neurocysticercosis
Background 
Neurocysticercosis is a common infection of the brain. It is caused by the larvae of the pork tapeworm that migrate to the brain and form an enclosed sac around themselves (called a cyst). Seizures are the most common symptoms, although some people may present with headache, vomiting, or other symptoms of brain swelling. 
This review investigated the usefulness of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) in preventing seizures in people who did not have seizures to start with, but presented with these other symptoms. We also examined the usefulness of AEDs in people with epilepsy due to neurocysticercosis, in terms of choice of drug, dosage, duration of treatment, side effects, and the quality of life. 
Study characteristics 
We included four trials, with a total of 466 participants, which focused on the comparison of short‐duration and long‐duration of AED treatment in people with a single brain cyst. The trials considered six to 12 months as short‐duration treatment, and 12 to 24 months as long‐duration treatment. 
Key results 
There were inconclusive results for the benefit of one duration of AED over the other (six, 12, or 24 months) for people with a single cyst. In people with calcified cysts, longer duration of therapy may be preferable. 
All four included trials enrolled people with a single brain lesion. The findings of our review cannot be generalised to people with multiple cysts, or with cysts in unusual parts of the brain. 
The evidence is current to January 2021.
