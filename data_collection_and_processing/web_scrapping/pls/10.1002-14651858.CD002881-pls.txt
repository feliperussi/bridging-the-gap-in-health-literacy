Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors for hypercapnic ventilatory failure in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease 
Some people with advanced chronic lung disease (COPD ‚Äê chronic bronchitis or emphysema) can experience breathing failure. This involves chemical changes which in turn can lower the drive to breathe. The drug acetazolamide is used for mountain sickness, and it can stimulate breathing in some circumstances. The review of trials found that a few days of using acetazolamide can improve the level of oxygen in the blood of people with COPD. It is not clear if this leads to better outcomes, so more research is needed. Not enough data were reported on the safety of the drug.
