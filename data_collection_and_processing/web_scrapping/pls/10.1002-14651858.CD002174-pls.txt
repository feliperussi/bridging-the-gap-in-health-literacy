Leukotriene receptor antagonists for non‐cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis
Leukotriene receptor antagonists are a new class of drug which may have an anti‐inflammatory action in some patients with asthma. In theory they may also be of benefit in bronchiectasis, but no randomised controlled trials have yet been reported so it is not possible to make a recommendation about their use in this condition.
