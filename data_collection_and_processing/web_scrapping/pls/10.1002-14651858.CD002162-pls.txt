Oral corticosteroids for bronchiectasis (stable and acute exacerbations)
Bronchiectasis is a chronic respiratory disease. People with the condition experience difficulty in clearing mucus from their lungs, leaving them prone to infections. Oral steroids have a place in the management of acute and severe asthma. In bronchiectasis, inhaled steroids have small benefits but there is no evidence for or against the use of oral steroids for this condition.
