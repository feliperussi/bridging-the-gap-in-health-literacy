Probiotics for treatment of Clostridium difficile ‚Äêassociated colitis in adults
Clostridium difficile (C. difficile) is a bacterium that attaches itself to the gut wall and is responsible for causing severe diarrhea and sometimes death in patients who have undergone antibiotic therapy for unrelated diseases. Antibiotics tend to wipe out the "good" or protective bacteria in the gut which allows colonization with C. difficile. Probiotics are bacteria and yeasts that resemble the protective bacteria of the gut and have been used in several studies to treat C. difficile infection. Unfortunately, these small studies do not provide enough evidence to support the use of probiotics for treating C. difficile infection.
