Mother‐to‐child transmission (MTCT) of HIV is the primary way that children become infected with HIV. More than 2000 children worldwide are infected in this way every day. 
Cesarean section before labor and before ruptured membranes (also called "elective cesarean section," or ECS) has been introduced as an intervention for the prevention of MTCT of HIV. The objectives of this review were to assess the efficacy (for prevention of MTCT of HIV) and the safety of ECS among HIV‐infected women. 
The authors found that ECS is a good intervention for the prevention of MTCT among HIV‐infected women not taking antiretrovirals (ARV), or taking only zidovudine. The risk of MTCT of HIV according to mode of delivery among HIV‐infected women with low HIV viral loads (low either because the woman's HIV disease is not advanced, or because her HIV disease is well‐controlled with ARVs) is unclear. Therefore, an important issue to be addressed in one or more large studies is an assessment of the effectiveness of ECS for prevention of MTCT of HIV among HIV‐infected women with undetectable viral loads, whether or not they are receiving highly active ARV therapy (HAART).
