Interventions for promoting physical activity
Not taking enough physical activity leads to an increased risk of a number of chronic diseases including coronary heart disease. Regular physical activity can reduce this risk and also provide other physical and possibly mental health benefits. The majority of adults are not active at recommended levels. The findings of this review indicate that professional advice and guidance with continued support can encourage people to be more physically active in the short to mid‐term. More research is needed to establish which methods of exercise promotion work best in the long‐term to encourage specific groups of people to be more physically active.
