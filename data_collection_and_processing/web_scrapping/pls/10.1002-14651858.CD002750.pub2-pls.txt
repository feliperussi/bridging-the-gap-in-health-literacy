Calcium antagonists as an add‐on therapy for drug‐resistant epilepsy
There is no evidence to suggest that calcium antagonists have a useful effect on seizures.
Nearly a third of people with epilepsy become resistant to antiepileptic drugs. Older drugs do not prevent seizures for everyone, and they have adverse effects. A range of new drugs have been tested as 'add‐on' treatments to try and improve the results from antiepileptic drugs. The calcium antagonist drugs flunarizine, nifedipine and nimodipine can be used as an add‐on treatment. The review of trials found no evidence to show a useful effect of these particular calcium antagonist drugs on seizures. Adverse effects of the calcium antagonists reviewed included dizziness, fatigue and unsteadiness (ataxia), however the percentage of adverse events were no more significant than with placebo.
