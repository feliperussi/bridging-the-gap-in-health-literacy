Nutrient‐enriched formula for preterm infants
Review question 
Does feeding preterm infants with nutrient‐enriched formula (extra energy and protein) compared with standard formula increase the rate of growth and improve development? 
Background 
Standard formula (designed for term infants) may not provide preterm infants with sufficient quantities of nutrients to support optimal growth and development. Nutrient‐enriched formula (containing extra protein and energy from carbohydrates or fat and other nutrients) has about 20% higher nutrient content than standard formula. Feeding preterm infants, particularly very preterm infants, with nutrient‐enriched formula might increase nutrient intake and growth rates, and might improve development. 
Study characteristics 
We found seven trials; most were small (involving 590 infants in total), and some were prone to bias. 
Key results 
Nutrient‐enriched versus standard formula for preterm infants does not reduce the time taken to regain birth weight but is associated with higher rates of weight gain and head growth (although not length gain) during neonatal unit stay after birth. Only limited data are available for growth and developmental outcomes assessed beyond infancy, and these do not show consistent effects. No evidence suggests other potential benefits or harms of nutrient‐enriched formulas, including effects on feeding or bowel problems. 
Conclusions 
Although available trial data show that nutrient‐enriched formulas increase growth rates of preterm infants during their initial hospital admission, they do not provide evidence of effects on longer‐term growth or development. Further randomised trials would be needed to resolve this uncertainty.
