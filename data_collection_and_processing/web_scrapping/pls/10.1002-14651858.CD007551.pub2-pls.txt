Statins for acute ischemic stroke
Stroke is a major public health problem than can cause death and severe disability. A limited number of drugs are available for treating patients with stroke. Statins, a group of drugs commonly used to reduce cholesterol levels, are known to be safe and effective when given to patients with an acute heart attack. Therefore, they may also be beneficial in patients with acute stroke. We identified eight relevant trials of statins in acute stroke involving 625 participants. Unfortunately, insufficient information was available to establish whether statins are safe and beneficial for patients with acute ischemic stroke
