Oral antibiotics for treating febrile neutropenia in cancer patients at low risk for complications 
Neutropenia (low white blood cell count) is a complication of cancer chemotherapy that exposes patients to life‚Äêthreatening infections. Current practice for neutropenic patients with fever is hospital admission and treatment with intravenous antibiotics. Febrile neutropenia encompasses a spectrum of disease severity and low risk patients may be treated less aggressively. This review of randomised controlled trials showed comparable death and failure rates for oral and intravenous antibiotics for low risk patients, those with solid tumours or chronic leukaemia or lymphoma, and independent of age, source of infection and severity of the neutropenia.
