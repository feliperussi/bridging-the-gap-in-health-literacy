Artemether‐lumefantrine (four‐dose regimen) for treating uncomplicated malaria
Malaria is a parasitic disease spread by mosquitoes. It affects millions of people worldwide and causes significant illness and mortality. Uncomplicated malaria presents with symptoms such as fever, headache, muscle pain, and vomiting. The parasite has become resistant to a number of previously effective drugs, and so combinations of drugs are used to try to prevent further resistance. Artemether‐lumefantrine is one such drug combination. This review of trials showed that, although the four‐dose artemether‐lumefantrine regimen was superior to chloroquine, in general the four‐dose regimen was less effective compared with the six‐dose regimen or other drug combinations. The fact that the four‐dose regimen is generally less effective means it is unlikely that it would be used for treating uncomplicated malaria.
