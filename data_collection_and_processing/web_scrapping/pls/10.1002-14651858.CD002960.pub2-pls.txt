Magnesium sulphate versus lytic cocktail for eclampsia
Magnesium sulphate performs better than lytic cocktail in preventing maternal deaths, further fits, respiratory depression, coma and pneumonia for pregnant women with eclampsia. 
Pre‐eclampsia, also known as toxaemia, is a condition which leads to high blood pressure and protein in the urine. Eclampsia is when a pregnant woman with pre‐eclampsia has one or more seizures (fits). Eclampsia is a serious threat to the life of both mother and baby. We identified three randomised trials, involving 397 women with eclampsia who were randomly assigned to treatment with magnesium sulphate or a lytic mixture of chlorpromazine, promethazine and pethidine that lowers blood pressure and is a sedative. Both drugs could be given either by intravenous or intramuscular injection. Although the trials were small and of average quality, the review found that magnesium sulphate was better than lytic cocktail at preventing maternal deaths, further seizures, and breathing problems and coma for the mother. Magnesium sulphate is also relatively cheap and easy to use. The adverse effects of magnesium sulphate come largely from its smooth muscle relaxant activity; respiratory depression is dose dependent and, with monitoring of the woman's clinical condition, uncommon.
