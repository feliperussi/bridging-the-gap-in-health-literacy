Gold may have a small impact on asthma for people dependent on corticosteroids, but adverse effects are serious and a lot of monitoring is needed. 
Some people need to rely on corticosteroid drugs to control their asthma. Corticosteroids help reduce the inflammation (swelling) of the airways (passages to the lungs) associated with asthma. Long‚Äêterm use of these drugs has serious adverse effects, so other ways to try and cut down on the need for corticosteroids are sometimes tried. Gold is used by people with some other kinds of inflammatory problems (such as rheumatoid arthritis). The review of trials found that people with asthma taking gold need careful monitoring as there are harmful effects, and it may only have a very small impact on asthma symptoms.
