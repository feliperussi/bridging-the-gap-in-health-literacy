Condylocephalic nails versus extramedullary implants for extracapsular hip fractures
A hip fracture is a break near the top of the thigh bone (femur). Those located further away from the hip joint are termed extracapsular. Such fractures may be surgically fixed using metal implants. Two types of implant are compared here. Condylocephalic nails, such as Ender nails, are inserted near the knee, and pushed up through the bone marrow of the femur and across the fracture site. Extramedullary implants consist of a screw or rod, inserted in the upper part of the femur to bridge the fracture, connected to a plate secured to the femur. This review found that, despite quicker surgery, Ender nails were associated with an increased risk of complications and reoperation when compared with extramedullary implants in common use.
