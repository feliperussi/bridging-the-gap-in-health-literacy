Pentoxifylline for diabetic eye disease
Diabetic retinopathy or eye disease is the leading cause of blindness in developed countries. Nowadays its treatment is based on the use of laser therapy. Since this is a procedure which destroys important cells in the eye, drug approaches have been developed to prevent or improve lesions in the eyes of diabetic people. Studies with the agent pentoxyfilline suggest this may have an important role in the outcome and progression of diabetic retinopathy.  Unfortunately, a thorough search for high quality data did not reveal appropriate studies.
