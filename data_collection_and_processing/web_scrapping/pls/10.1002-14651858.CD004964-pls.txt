Amphetamines for schizophrenia
We undertook this review with an aim to summarise randomised experimental research findings concerning the effects of amphetamines on people with schizophrenia. Most of the potentially relevant data were unusable hence it is impossible to draw firm conclusions. The findings of one small short study suggested that amphetamines may cause a reduction of the apathy and lack of energy which is often associated with schizophrenia, and this could explain why those with schizophrenia persist in taking these potentially damaging drugs.
