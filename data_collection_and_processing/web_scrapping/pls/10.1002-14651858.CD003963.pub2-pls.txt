Insufficient evidence from trials comparing CAPD (home dialysis without a machine) with hospital dialysis for people with kidney failure 
When people's kidneys fail (end‐stage kidney disease), they need either a transplant or dialysis to keep performing the kidney's functions. Dialysis can involve either regular visits to hospital for time on an artificial kidney machine (haemodialysis), or home dialysis. Home dialysis (CAPD ‐ continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis) is a 'do it yourself' option that does not require a machine. It involves a tube permanently inserted through the abdomen to allow a fluid called dialysate to be emptied and replaced every day. The review found only one trial comparing the effects of CAPD and haemodialysis. No conclusions could be drawn.
