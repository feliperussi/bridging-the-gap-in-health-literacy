Inhaled corticosteroids for acute asthma following emergency department discharge
Acute asthma is a common cause of visits to emergency departments (ED) and the majority of patients are treated and discharged home. Some people will have a relapse of acute asthma within two weeks of being discharged after apparently successful treatment. Beta2‐agonist drugs are used to open the muscles in the airways and corticosteroids drugs are used to reduce inflammation of the swollen airways. Corticosteroids can be inhaled (ICS) or swallowed as a tablet (so‐called oral corticosteroids). ICS may reduce adverse effects and get to the airways more directly than oral corticosteroids. This review of trials found that there was insufficient evidence that inhaling corticosteroids as well as taking the drugs orally is better than oral use alone, after emergency department treatment for an asthma attack. There is also insufficient evidence that taking ICS alone is as good as taking them orally, although there is some evidence to support using ICS alone for mild asthma attacks after emergency department discharge. More research is needed.
