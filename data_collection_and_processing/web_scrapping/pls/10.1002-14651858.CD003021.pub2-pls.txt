Treatment for amphetamine withdrawal
Symptoms of amphetamine withdrawal during the initial days of abstinence from chronic amphetamine use can prompt individuals to return to regular drug use. No medications demonstrate significant effects over placebo in reducing symptoms of acute amphetamine withdrawal.   Amphetamines can make people feel more alert, and are prescribed for problems like depression and attention deficit order. Amphetamines can produce euphoria, and so are manufactured for recreational use. Ongoing use can lead to dependence, which can be as hard to recover from as dependence on heroin or cocaine.  The only randomized trials of amphetamine withdrawal agents have been of antidepressant drugs (amineptine and mirtazapine).   Amineptine was found to have limited benefits, showing improvement only on some subjective effects but is no longer on the market because of concerns over its abuse liability. The benefits of mirtazapine have been less clear based on two randomised controlled trials, with one showing improvements in amphetamine withdrawal symptoms and the other showing no differences in withdrawal outcomes when compared to placebo.  More research is needed.
