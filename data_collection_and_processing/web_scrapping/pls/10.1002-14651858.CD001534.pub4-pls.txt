Long‐term antibiotics for preventing recurrent urinary tract infection in children
What is the issue? 
Bladder and kidney infections (urinary tract infection ‐ UTI) are common in children, especially girls. They cause an uncomfortable illness that can include vomiting, fever and tiredness. In some children kidney damage may occur, as can repeat illnesses. With repeated infections the risk of kidney damage increases. Some doctors prescribe long‐term antibiotics to try to prevent infections recurring, but this may cause the child to be unwell in other ways, e.g. vomiting 
What did we do? 
We searched electronic databases and reference lists to identify and summarise findings from all randomised controlled trials that compared low dose antibiotics given for at least 2 months, with no treatment or a placebo in children at risk of a UTI. We also identified studies comparing different types and doses of antibiotics. 
What did we find? 
We included 16 studies (2036 children randomised, 1977 analysed). This review found that long‐term antibiotics may reduce the risk of repeat symptomatic infections but the benefit is probably small and must be weighed against the likelihood that future infections are likely to be caused by bacteria that are resistant to the antibiotic given. 
Conclusions 
Long‐term, low dose antibiotics to prevent repeat UTI should be reserved for those children at high risk of repeat infection, such as young infants, and children clinicians would strongly want to reduce the risk of further infections, such as children with renal abnormalities.
