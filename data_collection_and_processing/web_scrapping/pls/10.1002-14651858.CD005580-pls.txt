Antipsychotic medication for elderly people with schizophrenia
Since the early 1950's the mainstay of treatment for schizophrenia has been drugs such as haloperidol and chlorpromazine. Although effective in controlling voices and fixed, false beliefs, these drugs are reported as having potentially disabling adverse effects such as tremor, stiffness and slowing of movement. The newer generation of drugs are reputed to be freer from these problems. This is particularly important for older people, who are more likely to experience adverse effects. Most manufacturers recommend prescription of reduced doses in the elderly. 
This review examines trials of these drugs for the treatment of elderly people with schizophrenia. We found three small, short trials. These did not have much information that was usable and we really could not draw any firm conclusions, except that such studies are possible and more are needed as a matter of urgency.
