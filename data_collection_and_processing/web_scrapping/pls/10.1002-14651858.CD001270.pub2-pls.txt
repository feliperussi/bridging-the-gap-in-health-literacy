Teaching critical appraisal skills in healthcare settings
Critical appraisal involves interpreting information, in particular information within research papers, in a systematic and objective manner. This review looked at whether teaching critical appraisal skills to health professionals led to changes in processes of care, patient outcomes, health professionals' knowledge of how to critically appraise research papers, or all three. The review found that teaching critical appraisal skills to health professionals may improve their knowledge. However, there was a lack of good quality evidence as to whether teaching critical appraisal skills led to changes in the process of care or to changes in patient outcomes.
