Passive movements for the treatment and prevention of contractures
This Cochrane systematic review determines the effects of passive movements for contractures.
Passive movements are regularly administered for the treatment and prevention of contractures. They are typically administered manually by physiotherapists or care givers. The primary aim of passive movements is to improve joint mobility. The results of this review indicate that it is not yet clear whether passive movements are effective for the treatment and prevention of contractures. 
What are contractures? 
Contractures are characterised by stiffness around joints that restricts joint mobility. Contractures are common in people with paralysis such as those with stroke, spinal cord injury and cerebral palsy, and they lead to various other complications such as pain, pressure ulcers and deformities.
