This review addresses two questions. First, "Does the oral administration of water soluble contrast media followed by serial abdominal radiographs during the following 24 hours predict the need for early operation or resolution?" 
Second, "Does the administration of water soluble contrast media in patients with adhesive small bowel obstruction facilitate the resolution of symptoms and shorten hospital stay?"  Six studies that addressed the first question were included. The pooled results indicated that oral gastrografin is a very accurate predictor of non operative resolution of adhesive small bowel obstruction with a sensitivity of 0.97, specificity of 0.96 and area under the ROC curve of 0.98.  Five studies addressed the second question were included, although Gastrografin does not reduce the need for surgery it does reduce hospital stay in those patients who do not require surgery.
