[Non‐pharmacological interventions for chronic pain in multiple sclerosis]
Review Question 
Do non‐medication treatments improve chronic pain in multiple sclerosis (MS) in comparison to inactive treatment? 
Background 
Chronic pain in people with MS (pwMS) is common, and treatment with medications can be associated with and limited by side effects such as confusion, falls, dizziness and drowsiness. Many non‐medication treatments are used to treat chronic pain in pwMS, which include exercise, psychology, electrical stimulation therapy, reflexology and others. 
Search Date 
We included all randomised clinical trials (clinical studies where people are randomly put into one of two or more intervention groups), which were published up to December 2017. 
Study Characteristics 
Overall, we found 10 studies evaluating different non‐medication treatments to treat chronic pain in persons with MS. The treatments evaluated included: transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation, transcranial direct stimulation, transcranial random noise stimulation, reflexology, psychotherapy and hydrotherapy. These studies included 565 participants and used a range of different methods to measure pain and other outcomes. Comparison groups also varied. 
Key Results 
Results from these studies show a very low level of evidence for the use of any non‐medication treatments for chronic pain in persons with MS. 
Quality of Evidence 
We assessed the overall quality of the studies as very low, as many studies included only small numbers of participants and had other methodological issues. More research with good methodological quality and greater number of participants are needed to determine the effectiveness of such treatments.
