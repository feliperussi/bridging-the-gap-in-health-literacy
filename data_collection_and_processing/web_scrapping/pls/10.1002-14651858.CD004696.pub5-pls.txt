Nutrient‐enriched formula versus standard term formula for preterm infants following hospital discharge 
Review question: Does feeding preterm infants formula enriched with extra nutrients versus standard formula (designed for term infants) after hospital discharge increase growth rate and improve development? 
Background: By the time preterm infants are ready to go home from the hospital after receiving care since birth, many are smaller and weigh less than they would have had they stayed in the womb instead of being born early. It may be that feeding preterm infants a formula enriched with extra nutrients (rather than standard formula used to feed term infants) helps them grow more quickly (and catch up with infants born at term) while improving their development. 
Study characteristics: We identified 16 eligible trials enrolling a total of 1251 infants through searches updated to 8 September 2016. 
Key findings: These trials provide moderate‐quality evidence that unrestricted feeding with nutrient‐enriched (vs standard) formula does not have important effects on growth and development up to about 18 months of age. Long‐term growth and development have not yet been assessed. 
Conclusions: Current recommendations to prescribe nutrient‐enriched formula for preterm infants after hospital discharge are not supported by available evidence.
