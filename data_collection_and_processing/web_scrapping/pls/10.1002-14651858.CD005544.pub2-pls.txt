Medications for increasing milk supply in mothers expressing breastmilk for their hospitalised infants 
Breastmilk remains the optimal form of enteral nutrition for term and preterm infants until up to six months postnatal age. Mothers of premature and sick infants are separated from their infants while they are receiving hospital‚Äêbased care. These mothers often have difficulty supporting lactation, when milk production is solely maintained by breast expression. 
In preterm infants, expressed breastmilk (EBM) given by a nasogastric tube, until sucking can be established, has been shown to reduce a bowel disease called necrotising enterocolitis where parts of the bowel become injured or dies. Further evidence suggests that EBM might improve feeding tolerance and may reduce infection. 
Trials of medications used to improve the breastmilk supply in mothers who have insufficient milk for their hospitalised preterm infants' needs have been reported in two randomised controlled studies involving 59 mothers. These two studies gave the women domperidone 10 mg three times a day when mothers had insufficient EBM, two to three weeks after delivery. These studies showed a modest improvement in EBM volume over the following one to two weeks. No side effects to mothers or infants were noted in these studies. 
These medications should only be considered in mothers who have received full lactation support and are more than 14 days post delivery but have insufficient EBM for their infants' needs.
