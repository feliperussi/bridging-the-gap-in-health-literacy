Thrombolysis for cerebral vein and dural sinus thrombosis
There is no good evidence on the effects of thrombolysis for cerebral vein thrombosis. Blood drains from the brain into the cerebral veins and then into the cerebral venous sinuses. If a clot forms in one of these blood vessels, it can cause headaches, seizures, loss of consciousness and other neurological symptoms. Clot dissolving treatments (thrombolytic therapy) could help to clear the clot and improve the patients' condition. However, thrombolytic therapy can cause serious or even fatal bleeding in the brain. The reviewers did not find any reliable evidence from randomised trials about the balance of risk and benefit from this treatment. Randomised controlled trials of this treatment are needed.
