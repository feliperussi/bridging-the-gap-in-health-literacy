Ketanserin is a drug that has been studied in the treatment of Raynaud's phenomenon and associated conditions. It is not widely used however. 
Raynaud's phenomenon is a disease that causes decreased blood flow and circulation to the extremeties. Symptoms include discolouration, pain, and in some severe cases ulceration of the hands and feet. It is most often triggered by cold, stress, and emotional discomfort. Primary Raynaud's phenomenon has no underlying disease associated with it. Secondary Raynaud's phenomenon is most often associated with scleroderma, but may also be related to systemic lupus erythematosus, mixed connective tissue disease, Sjorgen's syndrome, dermatomyositis, or rheumatoid arthritis. Scleroderma is a connective tissue disease causing hardening and commonly affects the skin and internal organs such as the GI tract, lungs, kidney and heart. 
Six trials which investigated the effect of ketanserin on 146 patients with either primary Raynaud's phenomenon or Raynaud's phenomenon secondary to systemic sclerosis were included (Cadranel 1986; Dormandy 1988; Kirch 1987; Lukac 1985; Ortonne 1989; van de Wal 1987). Patients treated with ketanserin experienced a greater improvement in mean functional index scores and more patients improved than those treated with placebo, however they also experienced more side effects and an increase in the frequency and duration of attacks. 
This review assessed a limited number of studies and therefore the conclusions reached need to be investigated further.
