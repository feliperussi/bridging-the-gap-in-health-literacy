Antibiotics for covert bacteriuria in children
Covert bacteriuria occurs when bacteria are found in urine either during routine screening or incidentally during other investigations. Unlike urinary tract infections, children with covert bacteriuria do not appear to have symptoms at the time of diagnosis. There is uncertainty about whether antibiotic treatment can help to clear infection, reduce recurrence, or prevent kidney damage. Any harmful effects of providing treatment also need to be identified and understood. 
We identified three studies reporting the results on 460 girls. There was insufficient evidence about the harms and benefits of treatments to draw reliable conclusions, but it appears that antibiotic treatment is not likely to benefit children in the long term.
