TEVAR versus open surgery for blunt traumatic thoracic aortic injury
Background 
Blunt traumatic thoracic aortic injury (BTAI) caused by motor vehicle accident and blunt thoracic trauma is a surgical emergency with high mortality rate. Most patients do not survive long enough to reach the hospital. Two main treatment options for BTAI are open surgery and thoracic endovascular repair (TEVAR). 
Study characteristics and key results 
We performed a review of the literature (current up to 20 August 2018) to determine whether use of TEVAR is associated with reduced death and illness when compared to open repair. We identified no randomised controlled trials on this topic. 
Quality of the evidence 
We found no studies undertaken to address our objectives; therefore we were not able to assess the quality of the evidence. 
Authors' conclusions 
We identified no randomised controlled trials on this topic. To perform a randomised controlled trial to clarify optimal management of BTAI would be very challenging to complete, mainly because of the natural history of the condition, usually seen in combination with other life‐threatening injuries, the requirement for urgent intervention and the potential difficulties surrounding consent. Despite lack of RCT evidence, clinicians are moving forward with endovascular treatment of BTAI on the basis of meta‐analyses of cohort studies and large clinical series.
