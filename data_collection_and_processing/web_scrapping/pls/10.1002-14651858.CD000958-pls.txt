Sulfasalazine for treating rheumatoid arthritis
Sulfasalazine has become a common second line drug (DMARD) for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). 
Six trials, including 468 patients were included. A statistically significant benefit was observed for sulfasalazine when compared to placebo for tender and swollen joint scores, pain and ESR. The standardized weighted mean difference between treatment and placebo was ‐0.49 for tender and swollen joint scores, and ‐0.42 for pain. The difference for ESR was ‐17.6mm. Withdrawals from adverse reactions were significantly higher in the sulfasalazine group (OR=3.0). Patients receiving placebo were four times more likely to discontinue treatment because of lack of efficacy than patients receiving sulfasalazine. 
Sulfasalazine appears to have a clinically and statistically significant benefit on the disease activity of patients with RA. Its effects on overall health status and radiological progression are not clear at this time, but would appear to be modest.
