Diuretics for preventing pre‐eclampsia
Not enough evidence for the use of diuretics for preventing pre‐eclampsia.
Pre‐eclampsia is a serious complication of pregnancy occurring in about 10% of women. It is identified by increased blood pressure and protein in the urine. Initially, women may not experience any symptoms. Constriction of blood vessels in the placenta, a feature of the disease, interferes with food and oxygen passing to the baby, thus slowing the baby's growth and sometimes it causes the baby to be born prematurely. Some women are affected by generalised swelling and, rarely, may have fits. Diuretic drugs cause people to excrete more urine and relax the blood vessels thus reducing the blood pressure. Because of these effects, it has been suggested that these drugs might prevent women from getting pre‐eclampsia. On this basis, these drugs began to be used in pregnancy; however, it was thought that they might interfere with the normal expansion in the blood volume during pregnancy and thus increase the risk of pre‐eclampsia. This review of five randomised controlled trials, involving 1836 women, sought to examine the evidence for diuretics for preventing pre‐eclampsia. All trials compared diuretics with either placebo or no treatment. However, only four trials (1391 women) reported on pre‐eclampsia. There were no significant differences in the outcomes except that diuretics were associated with more nausea and vomiting.
