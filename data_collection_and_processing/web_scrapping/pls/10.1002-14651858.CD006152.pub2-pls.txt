Lower limb surgery to release trapped nerves in diabetic neuropathy
This review analyzed the role of decompressive surgery of lower limb nerves for symmetrical diabetic peripheral neuropathy. Peripheral neuropathy is one of the most common complications of diabetes. Pain and numbness in the feet are common features. Pain may impair the quality of life and lack of feeling puts the diabetic foot at increased risk of ulceration. Strict glucose control may reduce the risk of developing diabetic neuropathy but once developed, neuropathy is irreversible and slowly progressive. New treatment strategies are needed to treat diabetic neuropathy. In this review, the role of surgical decompression of "entrapped" peripheral nerves as an alternative approach to treatment for diabetic neuropathy was analyzed.
