Early compared with delayed oral fluids and food after caesarean section
Drinking and eating again soon after caesarean section does not seem to cause women any problems, and may even speed recovery. 
There is a lot of variation in policies about when women are allowed to eat or drink after caesarean section. In some hospitals, women are not allowed to have food or fluids for more than 24 hours after the operation, in the belief that it might take a while for the bowels to settle down after abdominal surgery. However, caesarean section may not disrupt bowel function at all. The review found the evidence from trials does not justify withholding food and drink after uncomplicated caesarean section. There is some evidence, although not strong, that early food and drink might speed bowel recovery.
