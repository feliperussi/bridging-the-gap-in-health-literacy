Aerobic exercise training programmes for adults with Down syndrome
Many people with Down syndrome have poor strength, poor muscle mass, and high body fat percentage and so are disposed to cardiovascular health problems. Although physical fitness has been suggested to improve physical and psychosocial health for a variety of healthy patient populations, information about the safety and effectiveness of aerobic exercise for adults with Down syndrome is lacking. This review identified only three small randomized trials. The results showed that only aspects of work performance (for example, maximal test time, maximal distance at the end of the exercise test) were improved after aerobic exercise training programs. Further well‚Äêdesigned research on larger population samples is required to evaluate potential benefits for psychosocial aspects in adults with Down syndrome.
