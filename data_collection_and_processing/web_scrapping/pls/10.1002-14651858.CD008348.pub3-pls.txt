Ultrasound (high‐frequency sound waves) plus a clot‐busting drug for  breaking down a blood clot blocking a blood vessel in the brain 
Ultrasound is used routinely for diagnosing and monitoring acute ischaemic stroke patients. Experimental studies suggest that ultrasound can help the effect of clot dissolving treatment (thrombolysis) in acute stroke. This systematic review was designed to find out whether adding ultrasound to clot‐dissolving (thrombolytic) drugs or to conventional treatment (sonothrombolysis) is safe and effective. We identified five randomised trials with a total number of  233 participants. People treated with sonothrombolysis appeared to have a greater chance of independent survival (although with some statistical uncertainty), and had more chance of opening blocked blood vessels without an increased risk of bleeding (intracranial haemorrhage). When small bubbles (microbubbles or nanobubbles) are added to sonothrombolysis, the risk of haemorrhage may increase. More research is needed to find out if sonothrombolysis is safe and effective and if there are subgroups of patients who will benefit more from this type of treatment.
