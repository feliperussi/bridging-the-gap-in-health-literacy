The effect of the immunosuppressive drug cyclophosphamide in people with multiple sclerosis 
MS is a chronic disease of the nervous system affecting young and middle‐aged adults. MS is supposed to be related to the immune system. CFX is an immunosuppressive drug used for various autoimmune diseases. As its use for MS is controversial, the Authors of this review aimed to assess CFX efficacy for patients with progressive MS. Among the pertinent literature, only five studies met the inclusion criteria of minimum methodological quality , with a total of 90 MS patients treated with CFX.  The data available were inadequate to attain all the objectives specified for the review. The Authors found poor evidence that CFX may slow progression in the medium‐term. They found also that side effects such as alopecia, nausea, vomiting and menses interruption (amenorrhea) occurred at high frequency, while some evidences might suggest adverse effects also after two years .
