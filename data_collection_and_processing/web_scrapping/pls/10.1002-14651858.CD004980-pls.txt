Surgery versus sclerotherapy for the treatment of varicose veins
Sclerotherapy (injection of a substance into the vein) shows greater benefits than surgery in the short term but surgery has greater benefits in the longer term. Varicose veins are a relatively common problem. Two treatments available are surgery and sclerotherapy. Both involve removal of the vein either by stripping it out (surgery) or by injecting it with a solution that causes it to collapse and be absorbed into the surrounding tissues (sclerotherapy). Neither treatment adversely affects blood flow through the limb. This review found that sclerotherapy was better than surgery in terms of treatment success, complication rate and cost at one year, but surgery was better after five years. However, the evidence was not of very good quality and more research is needed.
