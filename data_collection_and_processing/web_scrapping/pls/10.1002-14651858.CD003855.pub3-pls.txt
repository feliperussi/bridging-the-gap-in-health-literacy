Surgery versus medical therapy for heavy menstrual bleeding
Review question 
Cochrane review authors compared the effectiveness, safety and acceptability of surgery versus medical therapy for heavy menstrual bleeding. 
Background 
Heavy menstrual bleeding is a common problem, which can impair a woman's quality of life. Surgical treatment includes hysterectomy and various methods of endometrial ablation or resection (cutting out or destroying the lining of the uterus). Medical treatment includes various oral medications and a hormone‐releasing device that is implanted in the uterus (levonorgestrel‐releasing intrauterine device, LNG‐IUS). 
Study characteristics 
We included 15 randomised controlled trials that compared surgery versus oral medication or LNG‐IUS. Participants were 1289 women with self reported heavy menstrual bleeding. The evidence is current to January 2016. 
Key results 
Hysterectomy, endometrial surgery and the LNG‐IUS were all effective in reducing heavy menstrual bleeding, though surgery was most effective, at least over the short term. These treatments suited most women better than oral medication. Although hysterectomy will stop heavy menstrual bleeding, it is associated with serious complications and most women should probably try a less radical treatment as first‐line therapy. Both conservative surgery and LNG‐IUS appear to be safe, acceptable and effective. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the evidence ranged from very low to moderate. The main limitations were lack of blinding, attrition and imprecision. It was difficult to interpret study findings over long‐term follow‐up because a large number of women randomised to medical treatment subsequently underwent surgery.
