Antifungal drugs used for prevention can significantly reduce the number of invasive fungal infections in liver transplant patients 
Invasive fungal infections ‐ infections of the bloodstream and organs within the body (e.g. meningitis, pneumonia, peritonitis) ‐ are important causes of morbidity and mortality in liver, pancreas, heart, kidney and lung (i.e. solid organ) transplant recipients. This review found that fluconazole, used as a preventive drug, significantly reduced the number of invasive fungal infections in liver transplant patients. More studies are needed to determine how effective antifungal drugs are for pancreas, heart, kidney and lung transplant patients.
