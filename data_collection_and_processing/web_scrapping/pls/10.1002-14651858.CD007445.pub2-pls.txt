Chlorpromazine for treating aggression or agitation due to psychosis
Chlorpromazine was the first medicine specifically developed to treat psychoses as it helps people to feel less anxious, tense or angry. This review systematically examines the evidence to see how effective chlorpromazine is at reducing aggression or agitation due to psychosis. From the evidence available, we are unable to draw any firm conclusion about using this medicine for this purpose. We found that chlorpromazine was just as effective at reducing aggression or agitation due to psychosis as similar medicines, but that it may be associated with more side effects than other medicines. Further research is needed to clarify whether chlorpromazine is effective at reducing psychosis induced aggression or agitation. Such research would be best carried out using carefully designed clinical trials.
