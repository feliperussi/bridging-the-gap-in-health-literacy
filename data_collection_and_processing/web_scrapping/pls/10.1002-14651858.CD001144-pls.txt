Moderately early (7‐14 days) postnatal corticosteroids for preventing chronic lung disease in preterm infants 
Moderately early use of steroids helps to get preterm babies off ventilators, reduces chronic lung disease, and may also improve survival to 28 days, but there are important short term adverse effects. Chronic lung disease (CLD) is usually caused by a persistent inflammation in the lung. Steroid drugs have been effective in improving lung function but early use is associated with an increase in adverse effects (see Early Review). The review of trials found that moderately early use of corticosteroids (started at 7‐14 days) reduces the risk of developing CLD. There is limited evidence about possible long term harmful effects. Short term adverse effects include high blood pressure, infection and an excess of glucose in the blood of these preterm babies. More research is needed. Steroid use should be limited until more information is available.
