Recombinant factor VIIa for the prevention and treatment of bleeding in patients without haemophilia 
The purpose of this review was to evaluate the evidence of effectiveness and safety for the use of recombinant factor VIIa (rFVIIa). This drug has been used in patients who are either at risk of major bleeding (e.g. because of planned high‐risk surgery), or who have uncontrolled bleeding (e.g. related to trauma). There have been many articles in the literature describing the off‐license use of this drug, which often suggest benefit. However, most of the publications are based on small numbers of patients (in case reports or case series) and may be affected by bias. Randomised controlled trials provide higher‐quality research findings and allow us to assess the evidence of drug effectiveness with more certainty. 
This review included 29 randomised controlled trials with 4290 patients. The trials showed modest reductions in total blood loss or red cells transfused (equivalent to less than one unit of red cell transfusion) with the use of rFVIIa. However, the reductions were likely to be overestimated due to the limitations of the data. We also observed an increase in the risk of having a blood clot in the arteries (such as a heart attack or stroke) in those patients receiving rFVIIa. When taken together, the data supporting the off‐license use of recombinant FVIIa are weak. The use of rFVIIa outside its current licensed indications should be restricted to clinical trials.
