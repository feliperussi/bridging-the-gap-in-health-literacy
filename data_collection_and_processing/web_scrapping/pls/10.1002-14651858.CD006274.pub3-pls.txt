Medically assisted nutrition to assist palliative care patients
Background 
It is common for palliative care patients to have reduced oral intake during their illness. Management of this condition includes discussion with the patient, family and staff involved, and may include giving nutrition with medical assistance. This can be done either via a plastic tube inserted directly into a vein or into the stomach or other parts of the gastrointestinal tract. It is unknown whether this treatment helps people to feel better or live longer. 
Study characteristics 
We searched the international literature for randomised controlled trials looking at the effects of medically assisted nutrition in adults receiving palliative care. Randomised controlled trials allocate patients to one of two or more treatment groups in a random manner and provide the most accurate information on the best treatment. The search was conducted in April 2013 and March 2014. 
Key results 
We found no randomised controlled trials. As a result, it is not possible to define the benefits and harms of this treatment clearly.
