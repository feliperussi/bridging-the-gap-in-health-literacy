Treatment of severe blunt pancreatic lesions in children
Background 
Optimal treatment of severe blunt pancreatic trauma in children has long been debated, some doctors advocate operation while others prefer a conservative approach without operation as primary treatment. We conducted this systematic review to assess which strategy should be preferred. Blunt trauma to the pancreas typically occurs after crashes involving a bicycle handlebar, road traffic crashes or other types of injury that cause a blow to the upper abdomen. 
Study characteristics 
We searched medical databases for randomised (where two groups of children were randomly assigned to treatment or no treatment) clinical trials of children treated for blunt trauma to the pancreas by an operation or no operation. The children were aged 17 years or younger. The search was current to June 2013. 
Key results 
We found no randomised clinical trials investigating operative treatment compared with non‐operative treatment of severe pancreatic injury in children, hence we have no firm evidence to support either operative treatment or non‐operative treatment of severe pancreatic lesions in children. Although difficult because of the rarity and the acute nature of these lesions, we recommend that multicentre randomised clinical trials of good quality are conducted.
