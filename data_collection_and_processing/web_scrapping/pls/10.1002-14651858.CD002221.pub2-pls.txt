Interventions for treating an inward turning lower eyelid in the elderly
Entropion is the inward turning of the eyelid, causing rubbing of the eyelashes and eyelid skin against the surface of the eye. It is one of the commonest forms of eyelid problems in older people and it more frequently involves the lower eyelid. In the early stages not all people require treatment but eventually every movement of the eye or eyelid causes trauma to the corneal surface which may lead to infection and ulceration with visual impairment. Surgery in the form of horizontal and vertical eyelid tightening is needed when the condition is severe and causes trauma to the cornea. The review authors searched the medical literature and found a single trial that met the inclusion criteria of the review. Sixty‐three participants with lower eyelid entropion were enrolled and randomised to either everting sutures alone or everting sutures and a lateral tarsal strip. Eight participants were lost to follow‐up. The trial showed that the combination of horizontal and vertical eyelid tightening with everting sutures and lateral tarsal strip is highly efficient for entropion compared to vertical tightening with everting sutures alone. Further research is needed to provide more credible evidence for the comparison of surgical treatments to correct an inward turning eyelid.
