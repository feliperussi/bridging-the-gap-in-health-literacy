Chinese herbal medicines for hyperthyroidism
Hyperthyroidism is a common illness in which excessive amounts of thyroid hormones circulate in the blood. Affected people, among other things suffer from increased heart beats, warm moist skin and raised body temperature. A large number of Chinese herbal medicines are used to treat this condition in China. Thirteen relevant trials with 1770 participants were analysed. All of them were of low quality. None of these trials analysed mortality, health related quality of life, economic outcomes or compliance with treatments. Some of these herbs may show benefits in improving symptoms, thyroid function and adverse effects. Unfortunately, we were unable to find reliable evidence to recommend a specific herbal preparation from 103 investigated formulations.
