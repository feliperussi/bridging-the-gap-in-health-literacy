Magnesium sulphate for preventing preterm birth in threatened preterm labour
Even short‐term postponement of birth when labour begins early (before 37 weeks) can help improve outcomes for babies, as the woman can take corticosteroid drugs to help develop the baby's lungs in a short time. Magnesium sulphate is one of the drugs that has been used to try to stop the uterus contracting in women who go into labour too soon. 
This review of 37 trials including 3571 women and their infants did not find that magnesium sulphate, given to women who go into labour too soon, prevented babies being born too soon or reduced the risks of the baby developing serious health problems. However, antenatal magnesium sulphate is effective in helping women who develop pre‐eclampsia (high blood pressure and protein in the urine) and for helping to protect babies' brains.
