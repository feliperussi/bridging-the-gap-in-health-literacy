Prophylactic caffeine to prevent postoperative apnoea following general anaesthesia in preterm infants 
Caffeine may be able to prevent postoperative apnoea and bradycardia in preterm babies. Growing babies who were born too early (preterm) and who undergo general anaesthetic for surgery may have complications, including episodes of apnoea (pauses in breathing), cyanosis (from lack of oxygen in the blood), and bradycardia (slow heartbeat). Caffeine, a methylxanthine drug, is thought to stimulate breathing, and so possibly prevent apnoea and subsequent problems. The review found some evidence that caffeine given at the time of surgery reduces apnoea, bradycardia, and cyanosis after anaesthetic, but the importance of this is unclear.
