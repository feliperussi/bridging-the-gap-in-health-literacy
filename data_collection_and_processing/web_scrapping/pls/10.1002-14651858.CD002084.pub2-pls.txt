Containment strategies for people with serious mental illness
People with severe mental illness can experience violent and aggressive episodes which can threaten both their safety and that of their carers. We looked for trials comparing different non‚Äêpharmaceutical containment strategies for people with severe mental illness to measure their effects but found none. The widespread use of these strategies is subsequently not supported by evidence from randomised trials, although such studies are both ethical and possible.
