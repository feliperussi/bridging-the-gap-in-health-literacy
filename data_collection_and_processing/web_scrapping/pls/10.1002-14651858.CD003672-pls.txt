No convincing evidence from one trial of the efficacy of cholinesterase inhibitors for dementia with Lewy bodies 
The characteristic features of dementia with Lewy bodies are dementia, marked fluctuation of cognitive ability, early and persistent visual hallucinations and spontaneous motor features of Parkinsonism. Other symptoms are repeated falls, syncope, transient disturbances of consciousness, neuroleptic sensitivity, and hallucinations in other modalities. This combination of features can be particularly difficult to manage, as antipsychotic drugs used to treat hallucinations, delusions and agitation will worsen Parkinsonian symptoms. The one included trial (of rivastigmine compared with placebo on 120 patients) showed no statistically significant difference between the two groups at 20 weeks. A possible beneficial effect on neuropsychiatric features was found only in analysis of observed cases, and may therefore be due to bias.
