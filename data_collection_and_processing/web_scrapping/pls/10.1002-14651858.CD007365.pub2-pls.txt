There is currently no high quality evidence to support the use of Huperzine A for the treatment of vascular dementia. 
Vascular dementia (VaD) refers to cognitive impairment associated with cerebrovascular brain injury. It influences quality of life seriously. However, there is no definitive medical or surgical treatment for vascular dementia. Huperzine A is an alkaloid isolated from the Chinese herb Huperzia serrata. It has been authorized for treating Alzheimer's disease (AD) and benign memory deficits since 1994 in China. The drug is available as a nutraceutical in the US. Although Huperzine A has been widely used in clinical practice and used as a standard intervention in clinical trials, its efficacy and safety in people with VaD are still uncertain. This review, involving 14 participants, indicates there is currently no high quality evidence to support the use of Huperzine A for the treatment of vascular dementia. Results from well‚Äêconducted randomized controlled trials are needed to assess accurately the benefits and harms of Huperzine A in people with VaD.
