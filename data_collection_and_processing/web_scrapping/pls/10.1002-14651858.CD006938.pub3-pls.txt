Droperidol for the treatment of nausea and vomiting (sickness) in people with advanced disease 
Nausea (a feeling of sickness) and vomiting are common and distressing symptoms for people with advanced cancer and other life‚Äêthreatening illnesses. Several medications to control these symptoms are available. Droperidol is one example, which has been used to try to prevent or treat nausea and vomiting for people having surgery or chemotherapy. In our search updated in November 2013 we found no randomised studies of droperidol for the treatment of nausea or vomiting for people receiving palliative care or suffering from an incurable progressive medical condition. Several studies reported on the use of droperidol for the prevention of nausea and vomiting associated with chemotherapy. Further studies are needed to find out which medications are most suitable to treat nausea and vomiting in palliative care.
