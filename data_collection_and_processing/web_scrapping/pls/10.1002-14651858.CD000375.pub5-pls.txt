Longchain polyunsaturated fatty acid supplementation in preterm infants
Review question: Whether feeding premature babies with formula milk supplemented with longchain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCPUFA) results in improved vision and overall neurodevelopment. Background: LCPUFA are a type of fatty acid necessary for the maturation of the brain and retina. Unlike breast milk that contains high levels of LCPUFA, most infant formulae are known to only contain minimal amounts of LCPUFA. Babies fed with breast milk are known to have more mature visual skills and a higher IQ (intelligence quotient) than babies fed with formula milk. It has been suggested that the relatively high levels of LCPUFA found in breast milk may contribute to the higher IQ levels and visual skills. Some milk formulae are available with added LCPUFA, usually as fish oil. Study characteristics: Studies that compared the outcomes of premature babies (born at < 37 weeks of pregnancy) who were given formula milk enriched with LCPUFA versus formula milk without enrichment with LCPUFA were analysed in this review. Key results: The researchers found that premature babies fed formula milk supplemented with LCPUFA do not have better outcomes compared to those fed formula milk without LCPUFA.  Quality of evidence: The overall quality of evidence was considered low.
