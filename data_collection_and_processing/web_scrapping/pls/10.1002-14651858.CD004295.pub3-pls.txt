Dan Shen agents for acute ischaemic stroke
Animal experiments in clinical practice suggest that Dan Shen agents might improve cerebral microcirculation. This review identified six randomised or quasi‐randomised trials of Dan Shen agents involving 494 patients with acute ischaemic stroke. There was no evidence that Dan Shen agents did more good than harm. There is not enough evidence to support the routine use of Dan Shen agents to promote recovery after stroke. Further high‐quality, large‐scale randomised controlled trials are needed to guide clinical practice.
