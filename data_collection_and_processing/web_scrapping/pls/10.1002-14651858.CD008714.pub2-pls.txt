Chlorambucil for patients with primary biliary cirrhosis
Primary biliary cirrhosis is an autoimmune disease of the liver. Chlorambucil has been used for patients with primary biliary cirrhosis as it possesses immunosuppressive properties. This review aimed to assess the beneficial or harmful effects of chlorambucil for primary biliary cirrhosis. The authors identified only one randomised trial, with 24 participants included. This trial compared chlorambucil with no intervention. The trial is small and at a high risk of bias, which suggests that the results may not be reliable. Meta‐analyses were not possible because of the inclusion of one trial only. Fisher's exact test and t‐test were used instead. Chlorambucil was not associated with significantly lower mortality when compared with no intervention. All patients on chlorambucil experienced adverse events, especially bone marrow suppression. Chlorambucil led to a significant improvement in mean serum levels of bilirubin, albumin, immunoglobulin M, serum aspartate aminotransferase activity, and hepatic inflammatory infiltrates. However, these outcomes are unvalidated surrogate outcomes for patient‐relevant outcomes. This means that improvement of these biochemistry measures cannot be taken as proof of improvement of patient‐relevant outcomes. It remains unclear whether chlorambucil can be supported or rejected for use in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis.
