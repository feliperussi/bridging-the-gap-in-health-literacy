Interventions for replacing missing teeth: maintaining and recovering soft tissue health around dental implants 
Missing teeth can be replaced by dental implants. However, keeping the gums around the implants healthy is important, as they can be negatively affected by dental plaque and its induced inflammation. Prevention of this may include daily implant cleaning techniques by patients and regular cleaning by dental professionals. Antibacterial mouthrinses may help reduce plaque and bleeding around dental implants, but there is no evidence that powered toothbrushes are better than manual toothbrushes or that brushing with a certain gel or dentifrice is better than another. Among the professionally administered treatments there is no evidence that phosphoric acid is more effective than scaling and polishing, that chlorhexidine enclosed in the inner part of implants is superior to physiologic solution or that a topical antibiotic inserted submucosally is better than a chlorhexidine gel.
