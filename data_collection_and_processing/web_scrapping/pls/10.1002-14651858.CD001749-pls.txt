No evidence of the efficacy of nicotine for Alzheimer's disease
Nicotine has been related to recovery of memory in humans and animal models and some observational studies have been compatible with a protective effect of nicotine inhalation against Alzheimer's disease. At present, there is great controversy over this possible effect of tobacco use, and evidence is inconclusive. This review found no evidence on which to recommend nicotine for Alzheimer's disease.
