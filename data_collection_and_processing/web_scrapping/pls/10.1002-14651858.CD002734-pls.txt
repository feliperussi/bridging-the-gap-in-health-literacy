Oral methylxanthines for bronchiectasis
Bronchiectasis is a lung condition that usually develops after a series of lung problems (such as childhood infections, lung structure problems, tuberculosis, and cystic fibrosis). Mucus (phlegm) collects in the lungs, causing discomfort and infections. Muscle spasms can also narrow the airways (passages to the lungs), causing breathing problems. Drugs to relax the muscles in the airways can help. Methyl‐xanthine drugs (such as caffeine, theophylline and aminophylline) can affect the muscles, and are sometimes used for other lung diseases. They can have adverse effects. The review found there are no trials of the use of methyl‐xanthines for people with bronchiectasis.
