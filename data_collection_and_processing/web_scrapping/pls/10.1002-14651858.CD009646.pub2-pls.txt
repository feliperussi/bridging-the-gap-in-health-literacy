Creatine for Parkinson's disease
Parkinson's disease is one of the most common neurodegenerative disorders and mitochondrial dysfunction plays an important role in its pathogenesis. Creatine has been shown to help improve mitochondrial function and may, therefore, useful for treating people with Parkinson's disease. Researchers from the Cochrane Collaboration examined the evidence on whether creatine is effective and safe to treat people with Parkinson's disease, used alone or as an adjuvant treatment, up to 10 November 2013. 
We included two randomized controlled trials with a total of 194 patients that compared creatine with placebo for people with Parkinson's disease. The effect of creatine on improvement of motor function, activities of daily living or quality of life after one or two years treatment for Parkinson's disease was uncertain due to the low quality of the trials and the small number of participants they recruited. The serious adverse events that occurred in the trials were not thought to be related to creatine. However, one trial reported higher rates of gastro‚Äêintestinal effects (including diarrhoea, nausea and constipation) with creatine.
