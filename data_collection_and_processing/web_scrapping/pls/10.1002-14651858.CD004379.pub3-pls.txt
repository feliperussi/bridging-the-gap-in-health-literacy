Interventions for 'poor responders' to controlled ovarian hyperstimulation (COH) in in‐vitro fertilisation (IVF) 
The successful end‐point of IVF treatment is for a woman to give birth to a live infant. This outcome is based on various factors including adequate number of retrieved eggs, which are obtained using various treatment protocols. Failure to recruit adequate follicles, from which the eggs are retrieved, is called a 'poor response'. Various treatment protocols targeted at these women have been proposed, aiming to increase their ovarian response. This review of ten randomised controlled trials suggests there is insufficient evidence to support the routine use of any one particular intervention in the management of women who are poor responders. More research is needed with good quality trials looking at relevant outcomes such as live birth rates rather than treatment‐associated outcomes such as positive pregnancy rates or number of eggs. Research is also recommended in adverse outcomes and costs of these treatments.
