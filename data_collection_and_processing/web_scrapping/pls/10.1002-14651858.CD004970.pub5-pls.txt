Interventions for replacing missing teeth: treatment of peri‐implantitis
As with natural teeth, dental implants can be lost due to gum disease (peri‐implantitis). This review looked at which are the most effective treatments to arrest peri‐implantitis. Nine studies were included in the review and evaluated eight different treatment modalities. In one small study of short duration (4 months), it was shown that the use of locally applied antibiotics in addition to the deep manual cleaning of the diseased implants decreased the depth of the pockets around the implants by an additional 0.6 mm in patients affected by severe forms of peri‐implantitis. In another small study of 4‐year duration, it was shown that placing an animal‐derived bone substitute with a resorbable barrier decreased the depth of the pockets by an additional 1.4 mm than synthetic bone. The majority of trials testing more complex and expensive therapies did not show any statistically or clinically significant advantages over the deep mechanical cleaning around the affected implants. In conclusion, at present, there is too little evidence to determine which is the most effective way to treat peri‐implantitis. This is not to say that currently used interventions are not effective.
