Therapy‐based rehabilitation services for stroke patients at home
People who have had a recent stroke are more likely to maintain their ability to carry out daily activities if they receive therapy services at home. Therapy‐based rehabilitation services for stroke survivors can include input from physiotherapists, occupational therapists or multidisciplinary teams. This review of 14 studies, involving 1617 participants, found that people who had a recent stroke were more independent in personal activities of daily living and more likely to maintain these abilities if they received therapy services at home. The amount of benefit that can be achieved is uncertain.
