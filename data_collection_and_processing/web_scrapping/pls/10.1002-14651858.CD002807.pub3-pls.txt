Techniques for surgical retrieval of sperm prior to intra‐cytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) because of absence of sperm in the semen (azoospermia). 
It is not certain whether any particular surgical technique used to remove sperm for ICSI (sperm injection in vitro fertilisation or IVF) is better than another for the men involved or for leading to more pregnancies. 
Some men are infertile because they produce sperm but a blockage in the testicle stops the sperm getting into the semen. In vitro fertilisation (IVF) is the only option for helping these men conceive with their own sperm. 
The sperm are surgically removed from the testis gland or epididymis (tube leading from the testis towards the penis) and several micro‐surgical and suction techniques through hollow needles can be used for this. Sperm are then injected into an egg, an IVF procedure called ICSI. However, the review found there were too few trials to show which sperm removal technique might be better. Complications associated with surgical sperm‐retrieval techniques are haematoma and fibrosis, identified by ultrasound.
