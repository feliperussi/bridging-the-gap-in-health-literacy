Biofeedback for pain during labour
Biofeedback is a therapy that aims to train women to recognise some body signals such as heart rate, muscular tension or temperature and, in consequence, change their body responses with the aid of electronic instruments that give a signal. It is an alternative approach that aims to allow women to gain control over their body responses, for example by concentrating on their rate, rhythm and type of breathing, and has been used as a behavioural therapy for multiple health problems, including pain. The purpose of the review was to see whether biofeedback, taught in prenatal classes, would have an effect in relieving pain during labour. The review includes four studies (involving 186 women who were pregnant for the first time). The randomised controlled studies were very different, and of poor quality, making it difficult to draw any firm conclusions. Most studies assessed the effects of electromyographic biofeedback, which measures muscle tone. There was no significant evidence of a difference between biofeedback and control groups in terms of assisted vaginal birth, caesarean section, augmentation of labour and the use of pharmacological pain relief. There was not enough information on electromyographic to assess its effect on pain during labour. This review is one in a series of Cochrane reviews examining pain relief in labour, which will contribute to an overview of systematic reviews of pain relief for women in labour (in preparation).
