Antibiotic treatment reduces duration and severity of travellers' diarrhoea.
Using a pilot system we have categorised this review as: Current question ‚Äê update pending. (See "Published notes" section for an explanation). 
Diarrhoea is a common problem for travellers, particularly travellers going from developed to less developed nations. The illness is frequently caused by a bacterial infection. Although the illness is unlikely to result in death, diarrhoea can disrupt travel plans and lead to severe or incapacitating symptoms. The review showed that antibiotic treatment shortens the duration and severity of diarrhoea. Persons taking antibiotics reported more side effects, but most side effects were minor, or resolved on stopping the antibiotic.
