Regular treatment with long acting beta agonists versus daily regular treatment with short acting beta agonists in adults and children with stable asthma 
Patients with chronic asthma are generally treated with a 'preventer medication' to reduce the underlying airways inflammation but often require bronchodilators for their symptoms. Treatment with regular long acting Beta‐agonist bronchodilator agents, such as salmeterol (Serevent) or formoterol (Foradil, Oxis), leads to fewer asthma symptoms during the day and the night, less bronchodilator medication requirement for symptoms, better lung function measurements and better quality of life measurements compared to short acting Beta‐agonist bronchodilators such as salbutamol (Ventolin, Asmol, Airomir) or terbutaline (Bricanyl). There were no major adverse effects but there is little information on the effects in patients who do not use a 'preventer medication'.
