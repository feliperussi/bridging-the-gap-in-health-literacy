There is not enough evidence about the safety and effectiveness of amantadine for people with Parkinson's disease. 
Parkinson's disease causes progressive muscle rigidity, tremors and other symptoms. The most common drug used to try and relieve these symptoms is levodopa, but serious physical and psychiatric adverse effects are common. Amantadine is another option, used alone or with levodopa. Amantadine can have serious adverse effects (including psychiatric problems), and people can become resistant to the drug. The review found that there is not enough evidence from trials about the effects of amantadine for people with Parkinson's disease. Adverse effects in trials so far have not been severe, and included skin rash, dry mouth and blurred vision.
