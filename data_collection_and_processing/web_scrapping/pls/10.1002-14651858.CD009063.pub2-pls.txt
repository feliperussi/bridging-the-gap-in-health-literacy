The use of pregabalin analgesia for patients with chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome 
It has been suggested that chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome is due to pain caused by the nerves in or around the prostate. Pregabalin is a pain killer that is specific for nerve pain. Therefore we conducted a search of the literature to evaluate the use of pregabalin for this ailment and whether or not it was better than placebo. 
We concluded that pregabalin was no more effective than placebo and is associated with adverse effects. 
Though there was no conclusive evidence for the use of pregabalin, further research is recommended.
