Different treatments for a squint (deviation of the eye) that occurs within the first six months of life 
Infantile esotropia can affect the vision in the eye, the ability to use the two eyes together (binocularity) and also be a cosmetic issue to the child/parents. Treatment includes surgical and non‐surgical interventions to reduce the squint and to enhance/aid binocularity in children. This review looks at the various interventions and also the timing of such treatment. The review did not find any randomised trials that compared treatment to another treatment or to no treatment. A large, multi‐centre, non‐randomised trial found that children operated on earlier had better binocularity at age six compared to the late surgery group. This group had been operated on more frequently however and there was no significant difference in the angle of the squint after surgery in either group. This review does not resolve the controversy regarding the best type of surgery, the value of non‐surgical interventions and the optimal timing of either type of intervention. It highlights a need for further research in this area.
