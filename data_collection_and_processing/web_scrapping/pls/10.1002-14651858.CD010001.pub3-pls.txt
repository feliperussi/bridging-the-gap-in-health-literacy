Vasodilators for women undergoing fertility treatment
Review question 
Researchers at Cochrane reviewed available evidence on the effects of vasodilators (drugs used to widen blood vessels) in women undergoing fertility treatment. 
Background 
For women undergoing fertility treatment for different causes, interventions aimed at improving the receptivity of the uterus are of utmost importance. Many different drugs have been evaluated, with the aim of increasing rates of implantation and live birth. These include vasodilating agents, which are used to dilate blood vessels to improve endometrial receptivity, thicken the endometrium, and favour uterine relaxation, among other effects. 
Study characteristics 
We found 15 randomised controlled trials (a type of experiment in which people are randomly allocated to one or more treatment groups) that compared the use of vasodilators versus placebo or no treatment in a total of 1326 women undergoing fertility treatment. The evidence is current to October 2017. 
Key results 
Only three of the included studies reported live birth rates. Overall, vasodilators probably make little or no difference in rates of live birth. Moderate‐quality evidence shows that vasodilators probably increase overall rates of side effects (including headache and tachycardia (faster than normal heartbeat)) in comparison with placebo or no treatment. However, low‐quality evidence suggests that vasodilators may increase the chance of becoming pregnant. 
Quality of the evidence 
The evidence is of low to moderate quality. More research is needed (one study is ongoing and will be incorporated into this review in a subsequent update).
