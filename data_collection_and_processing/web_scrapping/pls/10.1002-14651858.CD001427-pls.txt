No strong evidence about the effects of sensory stimulation for a brain‚Äêinjured person in a coma 
About half of people in a coma (deep unconsciousness) because of traumatic brain injury will wake within a year of the accident. Speeding recovery to allow people to wake sooner is a priority for them and their family. One type of treatment uses sensory stimulation to try to keep the person's brain working normally. Sensory stimulation methods vary greatly, from one or two hourly sessions of a day, through to shorter sessions every hour for 12 to 14 hours a day. The review found there is no strong evidence to determine whether sensory stimulation benefits people in comas.
