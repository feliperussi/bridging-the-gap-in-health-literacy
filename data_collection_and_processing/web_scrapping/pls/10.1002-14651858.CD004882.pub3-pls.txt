Chinese herbs combined with Western medicine for treating severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) 
Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is an acute respiratory disease, characterised by influenza‐like (flu‐like) symptoms, which first appeared in 2002. SARS is a rapidly progressive, acute, community‐acquired respiratory illness, which spreads to all contacts. Integrated Chinese and Western medicines played an important role in the treatment of SARS and this review assessed the effectiveness and safety of this integrated treatment approach. Among 5327 confirmed cases, 3104 patients received traditional Chinese medicine. We explored the role of Chinese herbs in treating SARS to offer an effective method for SARS treatment. 
We identified 12 randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and one quasi‐RCT involving 640 SARS patients. Clinical evidence shows that integrated Western and Chinese medicine does not decrease the mortality rate. It is possible that different Chinese herbs combined with Western medicines may improve symptoms, quality of life and absorption of pulmonary infiltration, and decrease corticosteroid dosage. No severe adverse events were identified. The evidence is weak because of the poor quality of the included trials.
