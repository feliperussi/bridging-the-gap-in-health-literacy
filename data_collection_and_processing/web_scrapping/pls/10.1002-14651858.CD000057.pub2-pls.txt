Clomiphene citrate for unexplained subfertility in women
Clomiphene citrate is a fertility drug that can increase the number of eggs released for possible fertilisation. It is used by women who do not ovulate regularly and by some who do but still have not become pregnant. Clomiphene citrate does not appear to increase the chance of pregnancy in women who ovulate regularly but have failed to conceive after more than a year of unprotected intercourse and so are considered to be subfertile. An associated risk of treatment with clomiphene citrate is a 10% chance of multiple pregnancy. The results of this review of trials should be used with caution due to the heterogeneity between some of the studies.
