No evidence that oral antibiotic therapy is less effective for treating urinary tract infection than intravenous antibiotics 
Severe urinary tract infection (UTI) is a common infection in adults and children, causing acute disease with a variety of symptoms such as fever and flank pain. This may lead to kidney damage, kidney failure or hypertension. Standard therapy involves antibiotics given at least initially by injection. This review identified 15 studies (1743 participants). The results of this review suggest oral therapy is equally effective in treating UTI and preventing long‚Äêterm damage. This might reduce costs but also inconvenience for the patient.
