Magnification devices for endodontic therapy
Review question 
Do magnification devices improve the success of root canal treatments (endodontic therapy)? 
Background 
Endodontic therapy is a treatment on the infected pulp of a tooth to remove the infection and the pain it causes. As the instruments for this treatment have become more complicated and precise, it is widely accepted practice that magnification devices should be used, with the hope that this will improve outcomes of the therapy for patients. There are different types of magnification devices that may differ in their ability to increase the success of treatments. However, there is little data to support the use of magnification devices, or help dentists decide which is the best one.

We did not find any studies that met the inclusion criteria for this review.
Quality of the evidence 
This review showed that there is no evidence available to assess whether magnification devices improve the success of endodontic therapy. There is therefore a need for further research to help clinicians and patients to make informed choices about treatment options.
