Treatment of high grade glioma with anti‐cancer drug (chemotherapy) coated implants
High grade glioma is a rapidly progressive form of brain tumour. Standard therapy involves the use of surgery (either biopsy or resection) and radiotherapy plus or minus temozolomide. Chemotherapy was not previously used due to concerns over efficacy and high risks of side effects. 
We found two trials, enrolling 272 people in total, with newly diagnosed high grade glioma, that studied the effects of implanting wafers coated with an anti‐cancer drug called carmustine (Gliadel®) in the area where the tumour was removed. This was compared with implanting wafers that contained no drug. Both groups received radiotherapy afterwards. Patients who received carmustine wafers had a longer survival without a demonstrably higher incidence of adverse events (side effects). 
A similar trial enrolled 222 people who had already been diagnosed with a high grade glioma and received surgery but had then had a relapse of disease. In this situation the trial found that Gliadel® did not improve survival or any other outcome measure looked at.
