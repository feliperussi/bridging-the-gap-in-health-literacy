Silver based wound dressings and topical agents containing silver for treating diabetic foot ulcers 
People with diabetes can develop foot ulcers. These are often due to reduced blood supply, reduced sensation, a change in the amount of movement in the lower leg, a foot deformity or the presence of some trauma. Therapies for foot ulcers include pressure reducing or relieving footwear and wound care through frequent dressing changes. Healing the wound can be delayed by poor control of blood sugar levels, compliance with therapies and the amount of bacteria on the wound surface. Foot ulcers in people with diabetes frequently become infected. Silver is an antimicrobial and dressings which contain silver have been developed. The authors of this Cochrane review wanted to find evidence on whether silver based dressings reduced infection and encouraged wound healing. They searched the medical literature for randomised and controlled clinical trials but found no studies which were eligible for inclusion in the review. We therefore do not know if silver containing dressings and topical agents containing silver are beneficial to diabetic foot ulcer healing.
