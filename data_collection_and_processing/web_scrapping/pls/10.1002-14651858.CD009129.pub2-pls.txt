Newborn circumcision for the prevention of urinary tract infections in infancy
Routine neonatal circumcision is a fairly common surgical procedure that may be carried out for medical or religious reasons. The incidence of urinary tract infection (UTI) is greater in uncircumcised babies. Circumcision is a relatively simple procedure and is associated with minimal complications when carried out in neonates rather than in later life. We did not find any trials to support or refute the effectiveness of routine neonatal circumcision to prevent UTI in infancy. Although limited data from previous studies have shown that this intervention might be beneficial, questions regarding the safety and effectiveness of routine neonatal circumcision for the prevention of UTIs in infancy remain unanswered.
