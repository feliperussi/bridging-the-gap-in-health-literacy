Doxapram versus methylxanthine for apnea in preterm infants
Doxapram and methylxanthine stimulate breathing in infants with apnea. Infant apnea is a pause in breathing of greater than 20 seconds. This can be harmful to the developing brain and cause dysfunction of the gastrointestinal tract or other organs. Drugs such as doxapram and methylxanthine are thought to stimulate breathing and are given to reduce apnea. The review of four small trials found that there was no large difference between the drugs in the short term. There is not enough evidence to exclude a small difference in benefit, long term effects or a difference in less common adverse effects. More research is needed into the long term and adverse effects of these drugs.
