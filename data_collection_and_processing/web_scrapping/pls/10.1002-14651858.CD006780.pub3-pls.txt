Antithrombotic therapy for improving maternal or infant health outcomes in women considered at risk of placental dysfunction 
Pregnancy complications such as pre‐eclampsia and eclampsia, intrauterine fetal growth restriction and placental abruption are thought to be related to abnormalities in the development and function of the placenta. Treatment with heparin to prevent the development of blood clots within the placenta appears to be a promising intervention to prevent these complications. The numbers of pregnant women with pre‐eclampsia, preterm birth, perinatal death and a low birthweight infant (weighing less than the 10th centile for gestational age) were reduced with this treatment. Ten randomised trials involving 1139 women met the inclusion criteria for the review. Nine studies compared heparin (alone or in combination with dipyridamole) with no treatment; and one compared triazolopyrimidine with placebo. The most commonly recognised side effect for women related to this treatment was mild skin bruising. To date, important information about serious adverse infant and long‐term childhood outcomes with using anti‐clotting medications is unavailable. Further research is required.
