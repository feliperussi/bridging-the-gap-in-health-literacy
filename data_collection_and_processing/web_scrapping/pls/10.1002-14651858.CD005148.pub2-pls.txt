Interventions to reduce weight gain in schizophrenia
Weight gain and obesity is a common problem for people with schizophrenia and both pharmacological (medication) and non pharmacological (diet/exercise) interventions have been tried to treat this problem. In this review we are able to show that small weight loss is possible with selective pharmacological or non‚Äêpharmacological interventions but it is difficult to be sure of the results because the studies were small and compared different interventions over different time periods.
