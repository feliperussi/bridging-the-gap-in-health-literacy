Chinese herbal medicine for treating recurrent urinary tract infections in women
Recurrent urinary tract infections (UTIs) are a common problem that can have a serious negative impact on well‐being and healthcare costs. Although preventative antibiotics can help reduce numbers of recurrent infections, there are growing concerns about antibiotic resistance, side effects and the lack of long‐term benefits from treatment. Consequently, alternative treatments such as Chinese herbal medicine (CHM) are being considered. 
We evaluated the evidence for the effectiveness and safety of CHM for treating recurrent UTIs in women. Our searches to May 2015 for Western and July 2014 for Chinese literature led to the inclusion of seven studies that met our selection criteria for this review. These involved a total of 542 women. 
The studies suggested that CHM used either on its own or with antibiotic treatment may be more effective than antibiotics alone for relieving acute UTIs and preventing recurrent episodes. There were only two studies that explicitly stated that adverse events were to be reported; neither reported any adverse events. 
However, studies were small and assessed as having poor methodological quality; and most study participants were post‐menopausal. Therefore, results should be interpreted cautiously and can only be considered as preliminary findings that may not be relevant to pre‐menopausal women. Further research is required to provide more rigorous evidence before CHM can be routinely recommended as a treatment option for recurrent UTIs.
