Non‐nutritive sucking for gastro‐oesophageal reflux disease in preterm and low birth weight infants 
Background 
Gastro‐oesophageal reflux is the passage of the contents of the stomach into the oesophagus (feeding tube) with or without vomiting. It is relatively common in preterm infants and can sometimes lead to troublesome complications. Non‐nutritive sucking is sucking on a dummy (pacifier) before, during, or after feeding by tube; before or after a bottle/breast feed; or outside of feeding times. It has been proposed as a way to reduce gastro‐oesophageal disease in preterm infants. 
Study characteristics 
We searched scientific databases for clinical trials in preterm infants (born at less than 37 weeks' gestation) and low birth weight (less than 2500 g) at three months of age or less with signs or symptoms of gastro‐oesophageal reflux. 
Key results 
We found no studies meeting our criteria. There is insufficient evidence from large clinical trials on the use of non‐nutritive sucking for gastro‐oesophageal disease in preterm and low birth weight infants. 
Quality of the evidence 
We found no studies meeting our criteria.
