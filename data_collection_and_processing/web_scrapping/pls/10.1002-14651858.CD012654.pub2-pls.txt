Ginseng for improving erectile function
Review question 
Does ginseng help men’s ability to have erections?
Background 
Many men have problems with gaining an erection. This can result in low self‐esteem, relationship issues and reduced quality of life. Medication and surgery can help with this problem, but studies also suggest that herbal supplements may help. We reviewed the literature to find out whether certain forms of ginseng, a popular root used in many countries, can help with erection problems. 
Study characteristics 
We included nine studies that compared the effects of ginseng against a placebo (dummy drug). These studies included 587 participants with mild to moderate difficulty in erection, aged 20 to 70 years old. All information we found was limited to a short follow‐up period of 12 weeks or fewer. 
Key results 
Compared to a dummy drug, ginseng may have a trivial effect on erectile function, as assessed by two questionnaires specially developed for this purpose. It may also have little to no effect on unwanted side effects. It may also have a trivial effect on men's satisfaction with intercourse based on responses to two specialized questionnaires.  
When men were simply asked whether their erections improved (without using a specialized questionnaire), the results of this systematic review show that ginseng may improve the ability to have intercourse.  
Certainty of evidence 
The certainty of evidence for most outcomes was low. This means that the true effect may be substantially different from what this review shows.
