Theophylline, aminophylline, caffeine and analogues for acute ischaemic stroke
Theophylline and related drugs, which can enlarge brain blood vessels, are of no apparent benefit in the early treatment of strokes caused by blood clots. Most strokes are caused by a blood clot which then reduces blood flow in the affected part of the brain. Without an adequate blood supply, the brain quickly suffers damage which is often permanent. Drugs which can improve brain blood flow might reduce damage and improve outcome after stroke. Theophylline and related drugs have the ability to alter brain blood flow. This systematic review assesses whether this type of drug improves outcome after stroke. The review identified two small trials, neither of which found any benefit. The limited amount of data mean that there is no evidence at present to suggest that theophylline and related drugs should be used in acute stroke.
