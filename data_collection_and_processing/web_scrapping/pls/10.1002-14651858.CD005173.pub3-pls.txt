Tiagabine in the maintenance treatment of bipolar disorder
People with bipolar disorder suffer from repeated episodes of severe mood disturbance. These can vary from mania to severe depression.  Sometimes manic and depressive symptoms can occur at the same time. Episodes may also fluctuate frequently, so‐called 'rapid cycling'. Periods of normal mood and function may occur in between these episodes, but this is not always the case. 
Medications are used to treat these mood episodes and to prevent their recurrence. Tiagabine could be one such medication. Currently, it is only licensed for the treatment of epilepsy. Patients with epilepsy appear to tolerate tiagabine relatively well. However, the following adverse effects have been reported: dizziness, tiredness, sleepiness and incomplete seizure control. 
This systematic review investigated the efficacy and acceptability of tiagabine compared to placebo and other mood stabilisers in the maintenance treatment of bipolar disorder. No randomised controlled trials were found. Currently, there is insufficient evidence on which to base any conclusions regarding the use of tiagabine in the maintenance phase of bipolar disorder, either in monotherapy or as an adjunctive treatment. There is a need for randomised controlled trials examining the efficacy and acceptability of tiagabine in the maintenance treatment of bipolar disorder.
