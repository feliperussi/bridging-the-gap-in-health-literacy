No trials on effectiveness of treatments to prevent latent tuberculosis from developing into active disease in people exposed to multiple‐drug‐resistant tuberculosis (MDR‐TB) 
The emergence and spread of MDR‐TB, caused by strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis resistant to at least the common drugs used for TB (isoniazid and rifampicin), is a threat to people worldwide. Treatment of latent tuberculosis (infection without active disease) has been a key component in tuberculosis control for several decades. However, MDR‐TB is spreading and people are dying. This review of evidence found no randomized controlled trials that have assessed the effectiveness of treatments of latent tuberculosis infection in people exposed to MDR‐TB. Currently the balance of benefits and harms associated with treatment for latent tuberculosis infection in people exposed to MDR‐TB is far from clear. Drug treatments should only be offered within the context of a well‐designed randomized controlled trial, or where people are given the details of the current evidence on benefits or harms, along with the uncertainties.
