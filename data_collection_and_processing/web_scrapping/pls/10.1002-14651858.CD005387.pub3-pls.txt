Physical activity programs for promoting bone mineralization and growth in preterm infants 
Babies born too early (premature babies) are often cared for in a fashion that minimizes physical activity to reduce stress and stress‐related complications. However, lack of physical activity might lead to poor bone development and growth, as seen in bedridden children and adults. It is believed that physical activity programs (moving and pressing all joints on all limbs for several minutes a day) may promote bone development and growth in premature babies. This review found that physical activity might provide a small benefit for bone development and growth over a short term. Data were inadequate to allow assessment of long‐term benefits and harms. Based on current knowledge, physical activity programs cannot be recommended as a standard procedure for premature babies.
