Better survival and reduced distant recurrence rate with combined chemotherapy and radiotherapy for cervical cancer 
Evidence suggests giving chemotherapy and radiotherapy together improves overall survival, whether or not cisplatin was used. The effect appeared to be greater in trials including a high proportion of patients with early stage disease. Combined chemotherapy/radiotherapy also delayed tumour recurrence and reduced the risk of re‐growth near the original cancer site as well as in other parts of the body. There was an increase in side‐effects, principally affecting the blood and bowel, but these generally only lasted a short time. Long‐term effects were poorly reported.
