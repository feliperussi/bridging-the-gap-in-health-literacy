The effects of oral xanthines (e.g. theophylline) for chronic asthma in children
Xanthines (e.g. theophylline) are a group of drugs thought to have helpful preventative and reliever properties in the treatment of asthma in children. This review of studies has established that there is evidence for useful effects of these drugs in terms of symptom relief and lung function, but also some evidence of side‐effects. As a primary preventative therapy, whilst there is evidence that xanthines are effective, this review suggests that more effective alternative treatment options (inhaled steroids) are available. In children with more severe asthma, the role of xanthines as an add‐on therapy has only been assessed in a small number of trials, which report mixed effects. More studies in this area would help to generate a more reliable overview of the effects of treatment in these children. Xanthines are an effective preventative treatment in childhood asthma, but less effective than inhaled steroids, and with a less favourable side‐effect profile. There is insufficient evidence at present to assess their role as "add‐on" preventer treatment versus newer alternatives. Some of the trials exposed the children they recruited to a pre‐trial phase of xanthine in order to maintain effective dosing during the trial. This could have made the trial participants less representative of the general population by making them more inclined to tolerate the study drug. This exposure also may have meant that they could recognise what drug they were taking during the blinded phase of the study.
