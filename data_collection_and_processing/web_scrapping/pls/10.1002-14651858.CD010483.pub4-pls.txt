Antiepileptic drugs for the treatment of infants with severe myoclonic epilepsy
Background 
Severe myoclonic epilepsy in infants (SMEI), also known as Dravet syndrome, is a rare, drug‐resistant form of epilepsy, for which stiripentol (STP) has been recently licensed for treatment when given in combination with other antiepileptic drugs. In this review, we evaluated the efficacy and tolerability of STP and other antiepileptic drugs for the treatment of SMEI. 
Results 
Upon systematically searching (20 December 2016) the medical literature, we found no randomised controlled trials (RCTs) assessing drugs other than STP. We found two RCTs evaluating the efficacy and tolerability of STP in 64 children with SMEI compared with placebo. Compared with patients given placebo, those receiving STP were more likely to be seizure‐free or to have 50% or greater reduction in seizure frequency. Only one study explicitly reported the occurrence of side effects, which occurred more frequently in patients treated with STP. These data, derived from two small studies, indicate that STP is significantly better than placebo with regards to efficacy but is not as well‐tolerated. Further studies should be conducted to unequivocally establish the long‐term efficacy and tolerability of STP in the treatment of patients with SMEI. 
The evidence is current to 20 December 2016.
