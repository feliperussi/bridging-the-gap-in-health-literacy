Adenoidectomy for recurrent of chronic nasal symptoms in children
Infections of the upper respiratory tract, presenting as recurrent nasal symptoms (nasal discharge with or without nasal obstruction) are very common in children. Removal of the adenoids (adenoidectomy) is a surgical procedure that is frequently performed in these children. It is thought that adenoidectomy prevents recurrence of nasal symptoms. 
Our review, which includes two studies (256 children), shows that it is uncertain whether adenoidectomy is effective in children with recurrent or chronic nasal symptoms. Further high quality trials are needed.
