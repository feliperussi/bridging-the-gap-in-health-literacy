Evidence supporting colchicine for alcoholic, viral, and cryptogenic liver fibrosis/cirrhosis is still lacking 
Alcohol and hepatotropic viruses are major causes of liver fibrosis and liver cirrhosis. Colchicine is an anti‐inflammatory and anti‐fibrotic drug. This systematic review could not demonstrate any significant beneficial effects of colchicine on mortality, liver‐related mortality, liver complications, liver biochemistry, or liver histology of patients with liver fibrosis or liver cirrhosis due to alcohol, hepatitis B, hepatitis C, or unknown etiology. Colchicine was associated with a significant increase in adverse events. Accordingly, there seems to be no evidence for using colchicine for alcoholic, viral, or cryptogenic liver fibrosis/cirrhosis outside randomised clinical trials.
