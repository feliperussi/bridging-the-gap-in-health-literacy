Are oral antibiotics as effective as a combination of injected and oral antibiotics for kidney infections in children? 
Acute pyelonephritis refers to infection of the kidneys and is the most severe form of urinary tract infection (UTI). Acute pyelonephritis causes high fever, vomiting, stomach pain, irritability and poor feeding in infants. 
We wanted to find out if oral antibiotics were as effective as combined oral and injected antibiotics to treat children for kidney infection. This review updates our previous investigations published in 2003, 2005 and 2007. This review included evidence from 27 studies that involved 4452 children. The last literature search date was April 2014. This update included evidence from three new studies and from one study that was previously excluded. 
Review results suggested that children aged over one month with acute pyelonephritis can be treated effectively with oral antibiotics (cefixime, ceftibuten or amoxicillin/clavulanic acid) or with short courses (two to four days) of intravenous (IV) therapy followed by oral therapy. If IV therapy with aminoglycosides is needed, single daily dosing is safe and effective.
