Surgery versus non‚Äêsurgical treatment for bronchiectasis
Removal of affected parts of the lung is often carried out in patients with bronchiectasis. A review was performed with the aim of identifying evidence for the benefit of surgery in bronchiectasis. No randomised controlled trials were identified so it is not possible to provide an unbiased estimate of the benefit of surgery for patients with bronchiectasis.
