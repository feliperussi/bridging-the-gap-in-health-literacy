Drugs used to treat the symptoms of patellofemoral syndrome have little evidence base
Patellofemoral pain syndrome is common among adolescents and young adults. The most common symptom is pain surrounding the kneecap when sitting with bent knees for prolonged periods of time or when performing activities like ascending or descending stairs, squatting or athletic activities. This review of pharmacological interventions showed that non‐steroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) may reduce pain in the short term, but overall pain did not improve after three months. There is conflicting evidence on the effect of glycosaminoglycan polysulphate. The anabolic steroid nandrolone may be effective, but associated risks demand extreme caution if used for patellofemoral pain syndrome, particularly in athletes.
