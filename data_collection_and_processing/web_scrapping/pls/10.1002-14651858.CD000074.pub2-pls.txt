Doxapram treatment for apnea in preterm infants
Doxapram stimulates breathing. However, there is not enough evidence to know if it is helpful in premature infants with apnea. Infant apnea is a pause in breathing of greater than 20 seconds. This can be harmful to the developing brain and cause dysfunction of the gastrointestinal tract or other organs. Drugs such as doxapram are thought to stimulate breathing and are given to reduce apnea. The review of one small trial found that apnea might be reduced in the first few days after treatment, but there were not enough infants studied to know if this was a significant effect. There is no evidence from this trial on longer term effects or less common adverse effects. More research is needed on the effectiveness, potential harm and long‚Äêterm benefits or adverse effects of these drugs.
