Vasoactive drugs for acute stroke
In patients who have just had a stroke (a sudden catastrophe in the brain either because an artery to the brain blocks, or because an artery in or on the brain ruptures and bleeds) very high and very low blood pressure may be harmful. Drugs which raise low blood pressure or lower high blood pressure might benefit acute stroke patients. This review of 43 trials involving 7649 participants found that there was not enough evidence to decide if drugs which can alter blood pressure should or should not be used in patients with acute stroke. More research is needed.
