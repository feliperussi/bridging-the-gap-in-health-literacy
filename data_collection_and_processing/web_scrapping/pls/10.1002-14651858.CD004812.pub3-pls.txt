Interventions implemented through sporting organisations for increasing people's participation in sport 
The sport sector is viewed as a priority area for increasing rates of physical activity. Participation rates in organised sport have been shown to be lower in females and to decline with age, and are reduced in lower socio‚Äêeconomic and minority groups. It is important to determine the most effective interventions that sporting organisations can use to increase people's participation and reduce inequalities. In this systematic review of the literature we did not find any controlled studies assessing the effects of interventions to increase participation in sport.
