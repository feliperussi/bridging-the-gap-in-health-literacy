Prophylactic versus therapeutic amnioinfusion for oligohydramnios in labour
Amnioinfusion can help when a baby is surrounded by too little fluid in the womb (oligohydramnios) and is showing distress, but is not needed otherwise. 
Oligohydramnios is a condition where too little fluid surrounds the baby in the womb (uterus). Oligohydramnios does not seem to affect some babies, but others may show signs of distress, such as unusual heart rates or the passing of a bowel motion (meconium). Oligohydramnios can be relieved by injections of extra liquid (salt or ringers lactate solution) through the woman's vagina or abdomen into the womb (amnioinfusion). The review of one trial, involving 116 women, found that amnioinfusion for oligohydramnios helps when the baby shows signs of distress. If the baby shows no signs of distress from oligohydramnios, then amnioinfusion is not helpful.
