Indoor air modification interventions for prolonged non‐specific cough in children
Prolonged, non‐specific cough is common in childhood and is treated with a variety of therapies. There is a growing market for non‐pharmacological treatments and these include air‐modification modalities, (ionisers, vaporisers, humidifiers, air filters and regular vacuuming). No randomised controlled trials examining the efficacy of air‐modulation modalities in the management of prolonged, non‐specific cough in children were found. Therefore, based on the evidence currently available, a recommendation for these treatments cannot be given. Due to the popularity of air‐modulation modalities, randomised controlled trials in this area are clearly needed.
