Exercise for overweight or obesity
Overweight and obesity are important public health problems and are associated with many serious health conditions. The risk of developing overweight and obesity depends on lifestyle factors such as food intake and physical activity levels. Treatment for overweight and obesity therefore commonly involves diet and exercise. We found that exercise has a positive effect on body weight and cardiovascular disease risk factors in people with overweight or obesity, particularly when combined with diet, and that exercise improves health even if no weight is lost. No data were identified on adverse events, quality of life, morbidity, costs or mortality.
