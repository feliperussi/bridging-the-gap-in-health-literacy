Superoxide dismutase for preventing chronic lung disease in mechanically ventilated preterm infants 
Not enough evidence to show the effectiveness of superoxide dismutase in preventing chronic lung disease in premature babies. Chronic lung disease (CLD) is a common problem in preterm babies who are mechanically ventilated (machine assisted breathing). Free oxygen radicals are believed to cause CLD. Superoxide dismutase is an enzyme normally present in the body to provide a defence against free radicals but preterm infants do not have a sufficient supply to provide natural resistance. Giving superoxide dismutase to preterm infants may therefore prevent CLD. The review of trials found there is not enough evidence yet to show if this is effective. More research is needed.
