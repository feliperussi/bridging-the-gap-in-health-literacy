Does electromagnetic field stimulation help heal fractures that are failing or have failed to heal? 
Broken bones (fractures) that do not heal (thus do not achieve "union") in the normal time period can lead to a loss of function and pain. This problem leads to a reduction in a person's quality of life and may prevent their return to work with consequent costs to society. This review determines whether treatment with electromagnetic fields is effective in healing fractures that have not united based upon the best available evidence. The review only looks at fractures of the long bones. These are the upper arm bone, the two forearm bones, the thigh bone, and the two lower leg bones. 
Four studies, which involved 125 participants, were included in this review. The majority of participants had suffered a broken tibia that had not healed as quickly as expected or at all. The results of this review suggest that there may be a benefit on bone healing from electromagnetic field stimulation. However, the available evidence was not good enough to be certain of this and it may not apply to current practice. Electromagnetic field stimulation appears to be safe. The two complications reported were minor involving irritation of the skin.
