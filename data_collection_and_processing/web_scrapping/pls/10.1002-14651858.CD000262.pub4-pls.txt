Antibiotics for treating bacterial vaginosis in pregnancy
Bacteria are normally present in the birth canal and are useful in maintaining the health of the vagina. However, if the numbers of some of the bacteria increase, this is called bacterial vaginosis. For some women, there are no symptoms but for others it may cause an unpleasant discharge and may cause some babies to be born too early. These babies can suffer from problems related to their immaturity both in the weeks following birth such as breathing difficulty, infection and bleeding within the brain as well as problems when growing up such as poor growth, chronic lung disease and delayed development. 
The review looked to see whether the use of antibiotics in women with bacterial vaginosis reduced the symptoms for women and reduced the incidence of babies being born too early.  We identified  21 trials, involving 7847 women.  We found that antibiotics given to pregnant women reduced this overgrowth of bacteria, but did not reduce the numbers of babies who were born too early. There were adverse effects sufficient to stop treatment or have the treatment changed when antibiotics were used and this needs further investigation. The effect of screening and treating women with abnormal flora needs to be studied in further trials and the effects of screening and treating proven vaginal infections is the subject of another Cochrane review.
