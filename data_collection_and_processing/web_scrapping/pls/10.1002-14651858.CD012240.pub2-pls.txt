Education of family members to support weaning to solids and nutrition in infants born preterm 
Review question 
We wanted to find out whether providing education to family members on weaning premature babies would improve their growth and development. We defined premature babies as babies born more than three weeks before their due date. 
Background 
Weaning refers to the introduction of solid food in babies to complement their milk intake. Weaning is an important period of time for the growth of premature babies. They are normally smaller than expected for their age at this time. Hence, good nutrition during weaning can improve their growth and brain development, besides preventing future cardiovascular diseases. Nutrition education to family members may be needed to achieve good nutrition practices during weaning. 
What we found 
We examined the evidence available up to the 26 June 2018. No studies could be included in this review. The lack of eligible studies in this review is likely due to the scarce evidence in identifying the ideal weaning strategy for premature babies. We found two studies that investigated the ideal timing for weaning in premature babies. These, however, found conflicting results. 
What does it mean? 
As there were no eligible studies, impact of nutrition education in weaning of premature babies is unknown. .
