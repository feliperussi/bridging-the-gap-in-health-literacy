Prevention of fungal infections in cancer patients with amphotericin B or fluconazole
Cancer patients treated with chemotherapy or who receive a bone marrow transplant have an increased risk of acquiring fungal infections. Such infections can be life‚Äêthreatening. Antifungal drugs are therefore often given prophylactically to such patients, or when they have a fever. The review could not detect a difference in effect between amphotericin B and fluconazole but several of the trials were designed or analysed in a way that disfavoured amphotericin B, which is the only antifungal drug that has been shown to have an effect on mortality.
