Treatment for POEMS syndrome (polyneuropathy, organomegaly, endocrinopathy, M‐protein, and skin changes) 
POEMS syndrome is a rare disorder of the blood which can cause a polyneuropathy (nerve symptoms such as numbness, tingling, pain, and muscle weakness) but can also involve many of the organs of the body, causing enlarged organs or organomegaly (usually liver, spleen, and lymph nodes), changes in hormone production or endocrinopathy (gynecomastia in men), abnormal blood protein (M‐protein), and skin changes such as increased pigmentation or skin thickening. Its cause is not known. The quality of life of people with POEMS deteriorates because of progressive neuropathy, and accumulation of fluid in the limbs or in the abdominal cavity or cavity around the lungs. It is a potentially fatal disease, and serious complications can arise due to multiorgan failure. There is no established treatment regimen, but potentially effective treatments that have been tried include chemotherapy, irradiation, corticosteroids, thalidomide or lenalidomide, and blood stem cell transplantation. This review found no randomized controlled trials of treatments for POEMS syndrome. Prospective treatment trials are needed to establish the relative values of different treatments.
