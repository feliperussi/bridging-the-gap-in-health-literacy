Septum resection for women of childbearing age with a septate uterus
Review question 
Cochrane authors wanted to know whether hysteroscopic septum resection (surgical removal of the septum) improves the chances of a live birth in women with a septate uterus, and whether these benefits outweigh the possible complications of the procedure. 
Background 
A septate uterus is an inborn abnormality of the uterus (womb), where the womb is divided into two cavities. Women with a septate uterus are at risk for subfertility, recurrent miscarriage, and preterm birth. Surgical removal of the septum is thought to improve these outcomes, but the effectiveness of this surgical procedure is unknown. 
Study characteristics 
We examined the research published up to May 2016. Randomised controlled trials that assessed the effect on reproductive outcomes of hysteroscopic septum resection in women of childbearing age with a septate uterus were eligible for inclusion. In these trials, women would be randomised to either septum resection or expectant management (no surgery). There were no studies to include so we cannot report on funding sources. 
Key results 
As in the 2011 version of this review, we identified no published randomised controlled trials to include in this update.
