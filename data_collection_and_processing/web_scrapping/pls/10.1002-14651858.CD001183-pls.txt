Nedocromil sodium for preventing exercise‐induced bronchoconstriction
Exercise‐induced asthma can limit people's endurance, prolong recovery time after exercise, and lead to people avoiding exercise. The episode involves symptoms such as coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath and chest tightness. The review of trials found that nedocromil sodium (Tilade) inhaled 15 to 60 minutes before exercise may reduce the severity and length of this kind of asthma for both adults and children, particularly those who have severe episodes.
