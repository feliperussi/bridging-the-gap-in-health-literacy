Olanzapine IM or velotab for acutely disturbed/agitated people with suspected serious mental illnesses 
Sometimes it is necessary to use medication to help stop aggressive or agitated behaviour that is thought to be caused by serious mental illness. Two ways of doing this are to give olanzapine as an injection into the muscle (IM ) or as a swiftly dissolved oral preparation (orodispersable or velotab). In this review, we attempted to summarise the effects of these approaches as seen from within evaluative randomised studies.  Data relevant to the effects of olanzapine IM are taken from some studies that may not be considered ethical in many places, all are funded by a company which has a pecuniary interest in the result. In addition, these studies often poorly report outcomes that are difficult to interpret for routine care. Other important outcomes are not recorded at all. Nevertheless, olanzapine IM probably has some value in helping manage acute aggression or agitation, especially where some of the older better known treatments cannot be given. Olanzapine causes fewer movement disorders than haloperidol and more than lorazepam. The value of the velotab preparation is untested in trials.
