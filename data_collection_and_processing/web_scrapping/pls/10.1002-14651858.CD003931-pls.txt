Rectal analgesia for pain from perineal trauma following childbirth
Rectal suppositories give short‐term pain relief for perineal trauma after childbirth.
Women often suffer pain if their birth involves trauma to the perineum (area between the vagina and the anus). This trauma can result from an episiotomy (surgical cut) or from a tear that requires stitching. There are ways to reduce the possibility of trauma, but for women with pain the review of trials found that rectal suppositories were effective for pain relief up to 24 hours after birth. Longer‐term effects have not been investigated. More research is required to assess the longer‐term outcomes and effects, if any, on breast milk, mother‐baby bonding and sexual functioning.
