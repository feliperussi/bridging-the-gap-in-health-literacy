Effects of blood pressure lowering drugs given in the first 24 hours of heart attack or stroke 
Reducing blood pressure with drugs has been a strategy used in patients suffering from an acute event in the heart or in the brain, such as heart attack or stroke. There is controversy whether these drugs should be used in the immediate period of these events, and what would be the best type of drug that renders the most benefit. This review looked at all studies where patients were randomized to one of these drugs or placebo, in this period. One class of blood pressure lowering drug, the so‐called nitrates, demonstrated reduction in mortality in patients with heart attack. For 1000 patients treated 4 to 8 deaths were prevented during the first 2 days of this acute event. The ACE‐inhibitors class also decrease mortality when continued for 10 days (3 to 5 deaths prevented per 1000). No other class of drug showed a reduction in mortality.
