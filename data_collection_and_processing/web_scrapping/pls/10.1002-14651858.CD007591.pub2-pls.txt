Single dose oral tenoxicam for acute postoperative pain in adults
Pain is commonly experienced after surgical procedures. Acute postoperative pain of moderate or severe intensity is often used (as a model) to test whether or not drugs are effective painkillers. In this case we could find no studies that tested oral tenoxicam against placebo. It is possible that the studies were done, but not reported, because they were used only to register tenoxicam with licensing authorities throughout the world. However, this leaves an important gap in our knowledge, and it means that we cannot be confident about using oral tenoxicam for acute painful conditions.
