There is not enough evidence to establish precise criteria for the prescription of prosthetic ankle‐foot mechanisms in individuals with a lower limb amputation. 
There are many different prosthetic ankle‐foot mechanisms available. When prescribing a prosthesis, the goal is to help individuals with a lower limb amputation return to their place in society, participating in activities that are important to them. This means finding a prosthesis that is appropriate for their level of activity, ability and weight. 
In high activity individuals with a transfemoral amputation, there is limited evidence for the superiority of the Flex foot during level walking compared with the solid‐ankle cushioned heel (SACH) foot in respect of energy cost and, gait efficiency. This benefit has only been confirmed in individuals with a transtibial amputation during decline and incline walking and increased walking speeds. In prescribing prosthetic‐ankle foot mechanisms for individuals with a lower limb amputation, practitioners should take into account availability, patient functional needs, the type of knee mechanism to be prescribed and the inter‐relationship with ankle‐foot mechanisms, and cost.
