Advanced training in trauma life support for hospital staff
Training in 'advanced trauma life support' (ATLS) is increasingly used in both rich and poor countries. ATLS is intended to improve the way in which care is given to injured people, thereby reducing death and disability. Some research has been done that suggests ATLS programmes improve the knowledge of staff who have been trained, but there have been no controlled trials to show the impact of ATLS‚Äêtrained staff (or staff trained in similar programmes) on the rates of death and disability of injured patients themselves. The review calls for more research and puts forward suggestions about how future research might be conducted.
