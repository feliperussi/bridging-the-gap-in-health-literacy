Reliable research about the benefits and harms of treatments for malaria in pregnant women is scarce 
Women are more vulnerable to malaria during pregnancy, and malaria may have harmful effects on the baby. Treatment options are becoming more limited because the malaria parasite is developing resistance to existing drugs and due to concerns about whether drugs may harm the baby. Evidence from randomized controlled trials is limited, with few drugs and drug combinations being evaluated.
