Antiplatelet drugs for preventing arterial and venous thrombotic events in patients with polycythaemia vera or essential thrombocythaemia 
Low‐dose aspirin as an antiplatelet therapy is the drug of choice for preventing cardiovascular events, but the potential risk of bleeding has limited its use in myeloproliferative neoplasms in the past. Evidence from this review of 630 people in two trials suggests that, in patients with polycythaemia vera and with no clear indication or contraindication to aspirin therapy, low‐dose aspirin may reduce the risk of thrombotic and all‐cause mortality. No data were provided on mortality from bleeding episodes. No studies in participants with essential thrombocythaemia and with antiplatelet therapy other than aspirin have been published.
