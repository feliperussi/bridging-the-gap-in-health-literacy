Prophylactic versus selective antibiotics for term newborn infants of mothers with risk factors for neonatal infection 
Several factors increase the risk of serious infection in term newborn infants, for example, the presence in the birth canal of a bacterium that causes infection in the newborn (group B streptococcus), rupture of membranes more than a day before delivery, or high temperature in the mother during labour. Some paediatricians routinely prescribe an antibiotic for the newborn infant if any of these factors is present, even if the infant appears to be completely well. Others believe that it is safe and appropriate to observe these infants and only treat those who develop signs of illness, or have other evidence of infection during the first day after birth. We found two small trials that addressed this question. Neither provided enough evidence to guide practice. A further larger randomized trial is needed.
