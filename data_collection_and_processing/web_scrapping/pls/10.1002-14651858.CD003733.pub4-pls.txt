Inhaled drugs for opening up the airways in cases of acute chest syndrome in people with sickle cell disease 
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about whether using inhaled, short‐acting bronchodilators for acute chest syndrome reduces illness and mortality in people with sickle cell disease and to assess whether this treatment causes adverse effects. This is an update of a previously published Cochrane Review. 
Background 
Sickle cell disease is an inherited blood disorder. People with sickle cell disease often suffer from acute chest syndrome, although it is not known why. Acute chest syndrome can cause fever, coughing, chest pain and shortness of breath and can be life‐threatening. Often, people with sickle cell disease and acute chest syndrome also wheeze. This suggests that airways are narrowed, as with asthma. Bronchodilators are drugs which relax the muscles in the airways, thus opening them up to make breathing easier. They are used in this way for asthma, so may be of similar use in acute chest syndrome.

The evidence is current to: 11 July 2016.
Study characteristics 
We found no trials to show the effects of these drugs for this condition.
Key results 
Research needs to assess the benefits and risks of using inhaled bronchodilators for acute chest syndrome in people with sickle cell disease.
