Sertindole for schizophrenia
This review includes three studies with a total of 1104 participants. We excluded two large important studies because they did not report any usable data. The three that were included suggested that sertindole (20 mg/day) was more antipsychotic than placebo, as acceptable as placebo (in terms of various adverse events including movement disorders and somnolence) and better tolerated than haloperidol. Sertindole was associated with fewer movement disorders than haloperidol, but was shown to cause more weight gain and the possible side effect of male sexual dysfunction. Cardiac problems (QTc intervals of at least 500 msec) were evident even in the randomised trials. Sertindole used at 16 mg/day (reported to be the most optimal dose by one study) caused more rhinitis than haloperidol.
