Glycerin laxatives for prevention or treatment of feeding intolerance in very low birth weight infants 
Review question: Are glycerin laxatives (enemas/suppositories) safe and effective for prevention or treatment of feeding intolerance in very low birth weight (VLBW) infants? 
Background: Preterm babies are at increased risk of feeding intolerance. Factors that contribute to feeding intolerance are many and include immature motility of the gut and increased viscosity of meconium. Enhancement of passage of the first stool (meconium) might enhance the ability of the preterm infant to tolerate feeds and might help reduce time spent receiving intravenous fluids. 
Study characteristics: Our review identified three studies that addressed the use of glycerin suppositories to prevent feeding intolerance in preterm infants. 
Key findings: We found that a glycerin enema given to preterm infants prophylactically did not shorten time to full feeding, nor did it decrease time to discharge. However, available data are too limited to allow a strong conclusion. 
Conclusions: Our review of available evidence for glycerin laxatives does not support routine prophylactic use of glycerin laxatives in clinical practice. Additional studies are needed to confirm or refute the effectiveness and safety of glycerin laxatives for prevention or treatment of feeding intolerance in VLBW infants.
