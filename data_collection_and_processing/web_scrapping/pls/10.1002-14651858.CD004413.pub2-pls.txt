Treatments for alopecia areata, alopecia totalis and alopecia universalis
There is no good trial evidence that any treatments provide long‐term benefit to patients with alopecia areata, alopecia totalis and alopecia universalis. 
Alopecia areata is a condition that causes patchy hair loss. The size and number of patches and progress of the disease can vary between people. It can affect the entire scalp (alopecia totalis) or cause loss of all body hair (alopecia universalis). Sometimes the condition will get better on its own, but in some cases it can get worse. 
Treatments include a variety of different creams or lotions applied to the scalp such as topical or oral corticosteroids, minoxidil and some light‐based therapies. Some of the skin treatments can have unpleasant side effects such as itching or hair growth in areas of the body away from where the cream was applied. Oral steroids may cause serious side effects. Also, there is no guarantee that any hair regrown during treatment will persist once the treatment is finished. 
We found 17 randomised controlled trials involving 540 participants. Only one study which compared two topical corticosteroids showed significant short‐term benefits. No studies showed long‐term beneficial hair growth. None of the included studies asked participants to report their opinion of hair growth or whether their quality of life had improved with the treatment.
