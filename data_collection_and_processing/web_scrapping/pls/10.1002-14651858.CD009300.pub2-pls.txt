Complement inhibitors for age‐related macular degeneration
Advanced age‐related macular degeneration (AMD) is an eye condition which principally affects the over 65s. In this age group it is the most common cause of loss of vision in the developed world, and the third most common cause globally. AMD causes loss of central vision. Despite advances in the understanding of AMD and the recent introduction of new treatments for some forms of AMD, the visual loss it causes is irreversible in most cases. When it affects both eyes, the impact on day to day functioning is huge. As the proportion of older people increases, larger numbers of people are likely to be affected by AMD in the future. 
The complement cascade is the name for a series of proteins which form part of the body's immune system, helping to fight infection. The complement system is constantly active at a low level, and is tightly regulated. However evidence suggests that complement cascade overactivity may play a role in AMD, and so it is logical that drugs which inhibit the cascade may have a role in the treatment of AMD. This review sought to identify trials investigating the potential benefits and safety of complement inhibitors for AMD. No relevant trials have been completed but we anticipate that updates of this review will in future have results to analyse. There is insufficient information at present to generate evidence‐based recommendations on the potential safety and efficacy of complement inhibitors for prevention or treatment of AMD.
