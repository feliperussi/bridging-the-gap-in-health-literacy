Reducing the number of drugs in combination antiretroviral therapy for HIV after initial virologic response reduces the effectiveness of the treatment 
Combination antiretroviral therapy can lower the amount of HIV in the blood, improve immune system function, and slow the progress of HIV. It is thought these drugs will need to be used for life. Keeping up this therapy, though, is difficult, and there are concerns about the adverse effects of the drugs and the development of resistance to the drugs over time. Therefore, attempting to use fewer drugs has been tried. However, the review of trials comparing combinations of three or four drugs, in patients who successfully completed initial therapy, with using fewer drugs found that a reduced number of drugs could not suppress the virus as well.
