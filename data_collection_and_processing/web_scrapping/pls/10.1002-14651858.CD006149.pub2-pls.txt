Interventions for previously untreated AIDS‐associated Hodgkin´s lymphoma in adults
There is a lack of evidence from randomised controlled trials for the efficacy and safety of different interventions for treating AIDS‐associated Hodgkin's disease, regarding both overall survival and disease‐free survival in treatment‐naive adults with AIDS. Lymphoma is a cancer of the lymphatic system. Lymphomas are classified into two general types: Hodgkin's disease and non‐Hodgkin's lymphomas. Hodgkin's disease is the most common non‐AIDS‐defining malignancy in HIV‐infected patients. Randomised controlled trials for the efficacy and safety of different interventions for treating AIDS‐associated Hodgkin's disease on overall survival and disease‐free survival in treatment‐naive adults with AIDS could not be found.
