Interventions for psychosexual dysfunction in women treated for gynaecological malignancy
This systematic review found very few good quality trials of interventions to treat or prevent psychosexual problems occurring in women after treatment for gynaecological cancer. They were mostly small studies and all examined different types of interventions. This review found only weak evidence to support the use of vaginal oestrogen, some low dose‚Äêrate brachytherapy regimes and a number of psychological interventions.
