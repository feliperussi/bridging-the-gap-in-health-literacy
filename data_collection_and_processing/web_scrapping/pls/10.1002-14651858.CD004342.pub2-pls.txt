Thrombolytic agents for arterial and venous thromboses in neonates
Major blood clots are infrequent, but serious complications that can occur in neonatal intensive care. Most often, blood clots are related to catheters (thin tubes inserted into the body), especially those inserted into the torso, for instance umbilical catheters. These are used in treating or monitoring sick newborn babies. Sometimes blood clots do not cause symptoms, but symptomatic blood clots can impair circulation and result in damage in the arms, legs, lungs, kidneys, heart, brain or intestines. The most common treatments are observation (no treatment), anti‐clotting drugs (heparin), or clot‐dissolving drugs (streptokinase, urokinase, and TPA). Surgery is also sometimes done. Administration of clot‐dissolving drugs (thrombolytics) has a risk of causing severe bleeding. It is important to understand which treatment of blood clots produces the best short‐term and long‐term results. However, a search of the medical literature found no randomized clinical trials that compared clot‐dissolving drugs with other blood clot treatments in newborns. Thus, no conclusions could be drawn.
