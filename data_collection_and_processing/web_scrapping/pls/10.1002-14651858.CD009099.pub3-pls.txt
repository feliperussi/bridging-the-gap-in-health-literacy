Diabetes, a condition which leads to high blood glucose concentrations, is a common condition with around 2.8 million people affected in the UK (approximately 4.3% of the population). Dressings are commonly used to treat foot ulcers in people with diabetes. There are many types of dressings that can be used, which also vary considerably in cost.This review (four studies involving a total of 511 participants) identified no research evidence to suggest that any type of hydrocolloid wound dressing is more effective in healing diabetic foot ulcers than other types of dressing.
