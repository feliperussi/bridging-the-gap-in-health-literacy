Xuebijing for paraquat poisoning
Paraquat is a non‐selective herbicide and is commonly used worldwide. At present, there is a lack of effective drugs for people with paraquat poisoning. Xuebijing injection is a complex traditional Chinese preparation consisting of Flos Carthami, Radix Paeoniae Rubra, Rhizoma Chuanxiong, Radix Salviae Miltiorrhizae and Radix Angelicae Sinensis. This review aimed to assess the effects of Xuebijing injection in people with paraquat poisoning. We identified two trials including 84 people. Although there were fewer deaths in people treated with Xuebijing injection, meta‐analysis showed that it did not have a statistically significant benefit on reducing all‐cause mortality in people with paraquat poisoning. Both included studies involved small numbers of participants and were considered to be of poor methodological quality. Xuebijing injection may be effective for people with paraquat poisoning, but the effects need to be proven by more high quality evidence.
