Inhaled versus oral steroids for adults with chronic asthma
Inhaled corticosteroids form the first choice for preventative treatment of asthma, but they remain expensive for health economies in developing countries. Oral prednisolone is very much cheaper. In this review, we found that, in the management of adults with chronic asthma, a daily dose of prednisolone 7.5 mg/day appears to be equivalent to a moderate to high dose of inhaled steroids (300‚Äê2000 mcg/day). Side effects may be present even with low doses of prednisolone, so if there is no alternative to oral steroids, the lowest effective dose should be prescribed. These findings may be use in developing countries where inhaled steroids are not widely available.
