Fibrin glue instillation under skin flaps to prevent seroma‐related morbidity following breast and axillary surgery 
A higher incidence of postoperative seroma (fluid collection under skin) in people undergoing breast and axillary (under‐arm) surgery for breast cancer is responsible for longer hospital stays, frequent repeat aspiration procedures, increased cost of breast disease, delays in the provision of adjunctive treatments and consequently potentially reduced overall all‐cause survival. Fibrin glue (FG) instillation under skin flaps after surgery produces a 'fibrin clot', sealing leaky lymph vessels, which leads to reduced seroma formation and related comorbidities. 
We systematically analysed the published trials comparing the usefulness of FG as a small‐vessel sealing agent. Eighteen randomised controlled trials on 1252 people were retrieved following bibliographic searches on standard medical databases. There were significant clinical and methodological differences among the included trials. The use of FG following breast and axillary surgery did not reduce the incidence of postoperative seroma, mean volume of seroma, wound infections, postoperative complications and the length of hospital stays. FG reduced the total volume of drained seroma and the duration of persistent seroma requiring frequent aspirations. 
This review showed no overall benefit of using FG. Although this conclusion is based on the combined analysis of 18 trials, the majority of these were of poor quality due to flaws in trial methods. Therefore, this conclusion should be taken cautiously and a major, multicentre, high‐quality randomised controlled trial on people undergoing breast and axillary surgery for breast cancer is required to corroborate this conclusion.
