Antimicrobial‐impregnated central venous catheters to prevent bloodstream infection in newborn infants 
Review question: In newborn infants requiring a central venous catheter (CVC), are antimicrobial‐impregnated CVCs compared to standard CVCs effective in preventing acquired bloodstream infection? 
Background: Infection in the bloodstream is a frequent and harmful complication for newborn infants who have a central venous catheter (a cannula that extends several centimetres into the infant's blood vessel). While the catheter may provide a secure route for delivering drugs and nutrition, it may also be a locus for infecting organisms to grow and cause long‐term or more severe infection. One potential method of reducing this serious complication is to use central venous catheters that contain antiseptics or antibiotics to stop organisms from sticking to or growing on the catheter. 
Study characteristics: We found only one small randomised controlled trial (with 98 very preterm infants participating) that addressed this question. 
Key results: This trial showed that central venous catheters containing antiseptics or antibiotics to stop organisms from sticking to or growing on the catheter could reduce the chance of infants developing a bloodstream infection by about 90%. Becasue the trial was small, however, this finding is not certain. 
Conclusions: The trial did provide some evidence that antimicrobial‐impregnated central venous catheters can prevent bloodstream infection in newborn infants, but further, large trials are needed to resolve this question fully.
