Antidepressants for agitation and psychosis in dementia
Psychosis and agitation frequently occur in older adults with dementia. Medications are often prescribed to treat these symptoms and antidepressants are increasingly used for these symptoms. We reviewed the evidence for the effectiveness and safety of antidepressants for the treatment of agitation and psychosis in older adults with dementia. We classified antidepressants based on their mechanism of action and included studies that compared antidepressants to treatment with either placebo or other medications frequently used to manage these symptoms. A total of nine studies (including 692 individuals) were identified, four comparing selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) to placebo, three comparing SSRIs to typical antipsychotics, and one study comparing SSRIs to atypical antipsychotics. One study compared the antidepressant trazodone to placebo, and two compared trazodone to haloperidol. Most of the studies included in the review were relatively small and of uncertain risk of bias due to methodological issues. The SSRIs sertraline and citalopram were associated with a modest reduction in symptoms of agitation and psychosis when compared to placebo in two studies. There were few other statistically significant differences in changes in agitation or psychosis or in most measures of medication tolerability for SSRIs or trazodone when compared to placebo or the antipsychotic haloperidol. We conclude that there is some evidence to support the use of certain antidepressants for agitation and psychosis in dementia and further studies are required to determine the effectiveness and safety of SSRIs and trazodone in managing these symptoms.
