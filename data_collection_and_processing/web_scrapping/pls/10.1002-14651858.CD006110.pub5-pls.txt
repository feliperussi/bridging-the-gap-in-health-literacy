Antibiotics for treating acute chest syndrome in people with sickle cell disease
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the effects and safety of antibiotics (alone or in combination) as compared to other antibiotics, placebo (a 'dummy' treatment) or standard treatment. We wanted to know if the different antibiotic treatments were effective, if they were safe, and which doses worked best for treating acute chest syndrome in people with sickle cell disease. This is an update of a previously published Cochrane Review. 
Background 
Sickle cell disease affects millions of people throughout the world. Acute chest syndrome is a major cause of illness and death in people with sickle cell disease. Symptoms include fever, chest pain and a raised white blood cell count. Acute infection of the lung tissue is a major cause of acute chest syndrome. Antibiotics are often given to treat these lung infections, but there is no worldwide standard treatment.

Study characteristics 
This update was unable to find any trials to include in this review.
Key results 
While we conclude that a randomised controlled trial should attempt to answer these questions, we do not envisage further trials of this intervention will be conducted, and hence the review will no longer be regularly updated. Until there is firm evidence, clinicians should treat acute chest syndrome on a case by case basis and according to the diagnosis and the treatment available.
