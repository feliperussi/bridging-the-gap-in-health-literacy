Manual therapy for asthma
Various manual forms of therapy are used to try and relieve asthma. Chiropractic and osteopathic techniques aim to increase movement in the rib cage and the spine to try and improve the working of the lungs and circulation. Other manual techniques include chest tapping, shaking, vibration, and postures to help shift and cough up phlegm. Massage is also used. Various therapists use these techniques, including chiropractors, physiotherapists, osteopaths and respiratory therapists. The review found there is not enough evidence from trials to show whether any of these therapies can improve asthma symptoms, and more research is needed.
