Single dose oral paracetamol (acetaminophen) for postoperative pain relief in adults
Pain is commonly experienced after surgical procedures, and is not always well controlled. This review assessed data from fifty‚Äêone studies and found that paracetamol provided effective pain relief for about half of participants experiencing moderate to severe pain after an operation, including dental surgery for a period of about four hours. There were no clear differences between doses of paracetamol typically used. These single dose studies did not associate paracetamol with any serious side effects.
