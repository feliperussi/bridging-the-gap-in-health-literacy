Comparing inhaled corticosteroids with long‐acting beta2‐agonists in treating chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) 
Inhalers containing corticosteroids, long‐acting beta2‐agonists or both can be used to treat severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). However, the benefits and harms of the two individual treatments are unclear when comparing one treatment with the other. 
We looked at clinical trials that compared the two kinds of inhalers to find the effects of each on health and well‐being in patients with COPD. We found seven studies (involving 5997 participants) comparing the long‐term benefits and side effects of inhaled corticosteroids and long‐acting beta2‐agonists for treating COPD. Overall, we found no significant difference between the two drugs in the number of people having an exacerbation (worsening of COPD symptoms). More people taking inhaled corticosteroids suffered episodes of pneumonia compared to people using long‐acting beta2‐agonists, although  pneumonia was extremely rare in both groups. Inhaled corticosteroids do not improve lung function as much as long‐acting beta2‐agonists but did improve patients' quality of life more than long‐acting beta2‐agonists. The differences in lung function and quality of life were rather small.
