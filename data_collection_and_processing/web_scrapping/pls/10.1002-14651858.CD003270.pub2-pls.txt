Azathioprine as an oral corticosteroid sparing agent for asthma
Asthma can be treated with drugs that aim to reduce inflammation in the airways. Inhaled corticosteroids are frequently used, but occasionally individuals require oral steroids for adequate control. However, oral steroids are frequently associated with severe side‐effects. Azathioprine has been suggested as a useful 'add‐on' therapy to oral steroid treatment with the aim of reducing the dose requirement in such cases of severe asthma. The review found two small studies which did not provide adequate evidence as to whether azathioprine could be offered to reduce oral steroid treatment. There is a need for well‐designed trials addressing this question before recommendations can be made.
