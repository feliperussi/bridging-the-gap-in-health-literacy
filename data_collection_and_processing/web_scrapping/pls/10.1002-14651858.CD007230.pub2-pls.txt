Edaravone for acute ischaemic stroke
Most strokes take place when a blood clot blocks a blood vessel leading to the brain. Without a proper blood supply, the brain quickly suffers damage, which can be permanent. The damage from a stroke can cause arm or leg weakness, or difficulties with language or vision. Data from some experimental and human studies have suggested that edaravone, a neuroprotective agent, may be beneficial for people with acute ischaemic stroke. It has been widely used in China to treat stroke. To obtain a reliable assessment of the effects of edaravone in acute ischaemic stroke, we reviewed data from three studies involving 496 participants. The quality of the trials was moderate. It would appear that edaravone is an effective treatment for acute ischaemic stroke. However, more high‚Äêquality and bigger sample trials are needed to confirm this result.
