People who undergo bypass surgery for narrowed coronary vessels may be less likely to need re‐intervention than those treated using angioplasty with stents 
Narrowing of coronary arteries can be alleviated by complete replacement using bypass surgery or, alternatively, unblocking and supporting the vessels open using angioplasty and stents. Analysis of RCTs to 2004 indicates re‐intervention (to alleviate subsequent narrowing) is needed less commonly after surgery than after stenting. Risk of death or heart attack following either treatment appeared the same, but this may be because too few trial participants were collected together in the review and variation between trials (heterogeneity) may be masking true differences. Further trials of new techniques in a greater variety of patients with subsequent systematic review are needed.
