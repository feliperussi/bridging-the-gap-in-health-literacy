Self‐management education and regular practitioner review for adults with asthma
Guidelines for the treatment of asthma recommend that patients be educated about their condition, obtain regular medical review, monitor their condition at home with either peak flow or symptoms and use a written action plan. The results of trials comparing asthma self‐management education to usual care were combined. These results showed that asthma sufferers who were educated about their asthma, visited the doctor regularly and who used a written action plan had fewer visits to the emergency room; less hospital admissions; better lung function; improvement in peak expiratory flow; fewer symptoms; and used less rescue medication.
