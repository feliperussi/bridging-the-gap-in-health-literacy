Corticosteroids for acute severe asthma in hospitalised patients
In an asthma attack, the airways (passages to the lungs) narrow from muscle spasms and swelling (inflammation), which can cause breathing problems, wheezing and coughing. Attacks can be fatal. Drugs (by inhaler, taken by mouth, or through the veins) can be used to relieve the muscles. Steroids (corticosteroids) are anti‚Äêinflammatory drugs that can reduce the swelling. The review found that lower doses of corticosteroids work as well as higher doses to start with, when a person is hospitalised with an asthma attack.
