Prevention of fungal infections in patients with cancer with amphotericin B
Patients with cancer who are treated with chemotherapy or receive a bone marrow transplant have an increased risk of acquiring fungal infections. Such infections can be life‚Äêthreatening. Antifungal drugs are therefore often given prophylactically to such patients, or when they have a fever. The review found that lipid formulations of amphotericin B had fewer adverse effects (less nephrotoxicity and fewer dropouts) than conventional amphotericin B. However, it is not clear whether there are any advantages of these formulations if conventional amphotericin B is administered under optimal circumstances.
