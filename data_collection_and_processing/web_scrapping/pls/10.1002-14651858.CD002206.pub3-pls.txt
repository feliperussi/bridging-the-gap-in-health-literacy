Media‐based behavioural treatments for behavioural problems in children
Cognitive‐behavioural interventions have been shown to be effective for reducing behavioural problems in children, but access to these treatments is limited by factors including the availability of therapists, time and expense. Providing the information required to manage these problems in booklet or other media‐based format such as DVDs, cassettes or computer programmes, would reduce the cost and increase access to these interventions. In general, this review found that media‐based therapies for behavioural disorders in children had a moderate effect versus no‐treatment and as an adjunct to medication.
