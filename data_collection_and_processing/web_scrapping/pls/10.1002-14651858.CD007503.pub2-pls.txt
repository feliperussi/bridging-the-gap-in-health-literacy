Antidepressants for depression in physically ill people
Depression in physical illness is common. Antidepressants have been shown to improve depression in people who are physically healthy, but there has been doubt about whether they are appropriate for people who are physically ill. This review examined clinical trials of antidepressants in physically ill people to determine whether antidepressants help these patients, and in particular if they lessen depression. We used standard methods recommended by Cochrane to identify and select studies and to collect and analyse the information. We extracted information on fifty‐one studies in the review. Our results found that antidepressants are better than a placebo (inactive) drug in treating depression in physically ill people. Both the two main classes of antidepressant, tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), were shown to be more effective than a placebo. Antidepressants improved depressive symptoms within 4‐5 weeks of treatment, and this benefit persisted after 18 weeks. However, patients taking an antidepressant were more likely to experience sexual dysfunction and dry mouth, and were more likely to stop taking their medication after 6‐8 weeks of treatment. There are no grounds to recommend one antidepressant over another on the basis of this review. We conclude that antidepressants appear to be useful in treating depression and should be considered for physically ill patients. The decision to prescribe antidepressants should take account of patients' preferences, symptoms, and possible interactions with other medicines they are taking.
