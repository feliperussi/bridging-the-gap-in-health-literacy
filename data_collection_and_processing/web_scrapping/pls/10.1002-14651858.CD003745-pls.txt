Indomethacin for asymptomatic patent ductus arteriosus in preterm infants
Indomethacin for very preterm or small babies with signs of PDA but no symptoms can prevent PDA, but more research is needed on long‐term outcomes. A common complication for very preterm (premature) or very small babies is PDA (patent ductus arteriosus). PDA is an open channel between the lungs and heart which should have closed after birth, and can cause life‐threatening complications. Indomethacin is often given to all babies at risk to prevent PDA, but it can cause adverse effects. It can also be given only to those babies who have early signs of PDA, but who have not yet developed symptoms. The review of trials found that this selective use of indomethacin can prevent PDA and has short‐term benefits, but more research is needed on longer term outcomes.
