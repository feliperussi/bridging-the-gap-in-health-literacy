Rectal 5‐aminosalicylic acid (suppository, foam or liquid enema) for maintenance of remission in ulcerative colitis 
5‐aminosalicylic acid (5‐ASA) is a commonly used medication for treatment of mild and moderately active ulcerative colitis (UC) and UC in remission. When UC affects only the lower third of the colon, 5‐ASA can be delivered as a rectal suppository, foam or liquid enema. This review includes nine randomized trials with a total of 484 participants. The limited data available suggest that rectal 5‐ASA is effective and safe for maintenance of remission in UC. Rectal 5‐ASA was found to be superior to placebo (e.g. enema or suppository with no active medicine). There was no difference in the incidence of side effects between rectal 5‐ASA and placebo groups. Side effects were generally mild in nature and common side effects included anal irritation and abdominal pain. Studies comparing rectal 5‐ASA with oral 5‐ASA (pills) found no differences in effectiveness for maintenance therapy. Well designed randomized trials are needed to investigate different doses of rectal 5‐ASA for maintenance therapy, Future studies should assess the effectiveness of combination therapy of oral 5‐ASA with rectal 5‐ASA as this has been found to be effective in active UC and has not been investigated for maintenance therapy. Future studies should also compare rectal 5‐ASA with rectal corticosteroids.
