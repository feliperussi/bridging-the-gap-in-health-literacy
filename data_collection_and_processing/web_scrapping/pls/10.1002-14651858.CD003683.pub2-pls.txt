Exercise to improve self‐esteem in children and young people
Improving self‐esteem may help to prevent the development of psychological and behavioural problems which are common in children and adolescents. Strong evidence exists for the benefits of exercise on physical health, but evidence for the effects of exercise on mental health is scarce. This review of trials suggests that exercise has positive short‐term effects on self‐esteem in children and young people, and concludes that exercise may be an important measure in improving children's self‐esteem. However, the reviewers note that the trials included in the review were small‐scale, and recognise the need for further well‐designed research in this area.
