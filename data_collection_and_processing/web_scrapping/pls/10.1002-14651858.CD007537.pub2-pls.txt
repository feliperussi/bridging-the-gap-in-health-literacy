No evidence‐based treatment option for inhalant dependence or abuse
Inhalants are being abused by large numbers of people throughout the world, particularly socio‐economically disadvantaged children and adolescents. This agent can cause many brain problems, for example, abnormal movement, sensory impairment, learning/memory impairment. Authors aimed to search and determine risks, benefits and costs of a variety treatments for inhalant dependence or abuse. Despite comprehensive searches of studies, the authors found no high quality study and, therefore, could not make any recommendation for the treatment of inhalant dependence or abuse. Research in this area is needed.
