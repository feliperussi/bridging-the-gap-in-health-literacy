Open surgical procedures for incisional hernias.
An incisional hernia is a bulge of tissue or an organ through an operation scar in the abdominal wall. Incisional hernias occur in 10 to 23 percent after abdominal operations.  This review question the choice of open operative repair technique, somehow controversial due to a high failure rate, reported as high as 54%. Open mesh repair has a lower failure rate (recurrence) than open suture repair, but mesh repair are complicated by more wound infections. No conclusions could be drawn on which type of mesh should be used because of lack of trials. Also no inference was drawn about the position of the mesh (below or above the fascia). More randomized clinical trials are needed to answer all the remaining questions.
