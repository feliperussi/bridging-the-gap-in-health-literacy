Lipid‐lowering agents for nephrotic syndrome
Nephrotic syndrome is a relatively rare disease in which the kidneys leak protein into the urine. A common early sign is swelling in the feet and face. Other signs and symptoms of nephrotic syndrome include low levels of protein in the blood, and high levels of fats in the blood, particularly cholesterol and triglycerides. 
Managing nephrotic syndrome includes therapies to reduce fats (lipids) in the blood. Several types of lipid‐lowering agents including statins, bile acid sequestrants, nicotinic acid and ezetimibe can be used. 
We looked for evidence from RCTs to establish if lipid‐lowering drugs were beneficial for people with nephrotic syndrome. We found five small studies that investigated four different lipid‐lowering drugs (simvastatin, lovastatin, fluvastatin, gemfibrozil) in 203 participants with nephrotic syndrome. 
There is currently not enough high quality evidence from published studies to determine if lipid‐lowering agents are helpful in managing dyslipidaemia in people with nephrotic syndrome.
