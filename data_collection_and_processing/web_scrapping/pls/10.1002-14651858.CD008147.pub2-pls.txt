Supplementary vitamin E, selenium, cysteine and riboflavin for preventing kwashiorkor in preschool children in developing countries 
Undernutrition is one of the leading underlying causes of childhood morbidity and mortality in developing countries. Providing antioxidants that would help curb excess free radicals in the body may help prevent the development of kwashiorkor. We identified one cluster‐RCT that attempted to investigate this. Based on the published evidence reviewed, we could draw no firm conclusions of the benefits of supplementary antioxidants for the prevention of kwashiorkor in pre‐school children. There is a need for further research in this area to be certain if antioxidant supplementation can help prevent kwashiorkor in young children.
