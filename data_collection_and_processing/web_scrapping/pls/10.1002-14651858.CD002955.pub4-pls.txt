People with dementia may benefit from naftidrofuryl
Dementia is characterized by chronic, global, irreversible impairment in cognitive functions, including memory, executive function and personality. It has a serious impact on patients' quality of life. Naftidrofuryl has been suggested as a treatment for dementia which may work by increasing the oxygen supply to brain tissue. The low‐quality evidence shows that naftidrofuryl may have benefits on performance, behaviour, cognition, and mood for patients with dementia. However, these benefits fail to translate into reliable clinically detectable changes. Naftidrofuryl orally administrated is well‐tolerated.
