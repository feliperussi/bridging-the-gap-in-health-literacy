Fibrin sealants have fewer proven benefits than some other technologies designed to reduce the risks associated with transfusions of donated blood 
Fibrin sealants are composed of specific blood clotting agents that, when applied to wound surfaces, help stop bleeding. In liquid form, fibrin sealants are generally sprayed directly onto wound surfaces. They are often used to try to reduce blood loss during and after surgery and therefore avoid blood transfusions. Although fibrin sealant components are derived from blood products, they have a lower risk of transmitting infections than donor blood. The review of trials found that fibrin sealants can reduce surgical blood loss and the need for blood transfusion. Fibrin sealants appear to be most effective when used in orthopaedic surgery.
