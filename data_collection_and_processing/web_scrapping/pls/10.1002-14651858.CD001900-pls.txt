Remacemide for drug‐resistant localization related epilepsy
Remacemide has only a modest effect as an add‐on treatment for drug‐resistant localization related (partial) epilepsy. 
Epilepsy is a disorder where recurrent seizures are caused by abnormal electrical discharges from the brain. Most seizures can be controlled by a single antiepileptic drug but sometimes they are resistant to those drugs. The review of trials found that the new drug, remacemide, has only a modest effect on seizures and was more likely to be withdrawn than placebo. It is unlikely that remacemide will be further developed as an antiepileptic drug.
