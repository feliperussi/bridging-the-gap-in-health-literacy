Erythropoietin as an additional treatment with (chemo) radiation therapy for head and neck cancer 
Severe anaemia in cancer patients is linked with decreased tumour oxygen supply (hypoxia), which is associated with more rapid tumour progression, poor response to therapy and consequently has a negative impact on prognosis. Erythropoietin (EPO), a hormone which controls red blood cell production, is widely used to correct anaemia. It was therefore thought logical that using erythropoietin to correct anaemia, before or during chemotherapy, radiotherapy (or both), would improve tumour oxygenation and as a result improve prognosis. 
The authors of this review found strong suggestions based on five randomised controlled trials (1397 patients) that for head and neck cancer, radiotherapy plus erythropoietin compared to radiotherapy alone negatively affects patient outcome in terms of overall survival and local‚Äêregional progression free survival.
