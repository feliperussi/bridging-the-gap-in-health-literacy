Surgical decompression for cerebral oedema in acute ischaemic stroke
About four‚Äêfifths of strokes are due to blockage of an artery in the brain. When the artery is blocked, part of the brain is damaged, this is called a cerebral infarct. If a large artery is blocked the area of brain damage can be large. About 24 to 48 hours after a large infarct the brain can swell, causing a dangerous rise of pressure inside the head. Surgery to remove some of the skull bone over the swollen area of brain reduces the pressure. Results from recent clinical trials showed that surgery reduced the risk of death. However, survivors were left with moderate to severe disability requiring help in their daily life activities. These results only apply to people 60 years of age or younger.
