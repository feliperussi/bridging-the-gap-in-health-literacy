Mifepristone for induction of labour
Not enough evidence on the effects of mifepristone (RU 486) to induce labour.
The female sex hormone, progesterone stops the uterus contracting during pregnancy. Drugs such as mifepristone have been used to stop the action of this hormone, either to induce labour or to allow the pregnancy to be terminated. The review of ten trials (1108 women) found there is not enough evidence to support the use of mifepristone to induce labour. There is little information about adverse effects for the mother or baby. However, there is evidence that mifepristone can reduce the need for a caesarean so further research is needed.
