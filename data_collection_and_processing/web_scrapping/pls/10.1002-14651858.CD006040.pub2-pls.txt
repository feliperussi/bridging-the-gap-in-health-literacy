Reconstructive Techniques After Rectal Resection for Rectal Cancer
Rectal cancer is a common cancer that requires surgical removal of the rectum and mesorectum for the best chance of cure. Advances in rectal cancer surgery have facilitated sphincter‐preserving surgery in the majority of these patients. However, many of these people will have significant functional difficulties, including fecal incontinence, urgency and frequent bowel movements. Several surgical techniques (Colonic J pouch, transverse coloplasty and side‐to‐end anastomosis) have been created as alternatives to the standard straight coloanal anastomosis.  In this systematic review, we surmise that the colonic J pouch results in superior postoperative bowel function for at least 18 months after surgery, and possibly longer. Furthermore, the transverse coloplasty and side‐to‐end anastomosis appear to have similar advantages, but in a limited number of studies.
