There is no evidence to indicate whether placement of a shunt to remove fluid is effective in the management of normal pressure hydrocephalus 
Normal pressure hydrocephalus is a rare but potentially treatable cause of dementia. Since the condition was first described in 1965, it has conventionally been treated by placement of a shunt to remove cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from the ventricles of the brain. No trial has yet compared the placement of a shunt versus no shunt in a randomized controlled manner. Nor have the long‚Äêterm outcomes of treated and untreated normal pressure hydrocephalus been compared. There is, therefore, no evidence for the use of shunts in the management of normal pressure hydrocephalus.
