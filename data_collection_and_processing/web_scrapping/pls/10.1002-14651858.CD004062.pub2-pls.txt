Antibiotics vs. acid suppression therapy (with or without long‐term maintenance acid suppression therapy) for the prevention of recurrent bleeding from peptic ulcer 
Peptic ulcers are caused by acidic stomach juices damaging the lining of the stomach (gastric ulcer) or upper small intestine (duodenal ulcer). This causes pain, indigestion and sometimes bleeding. Bleeding in the gut can be life‐threatening. Several treatments aim to heal the ulcer and prevent future bleeding. These include acid‐suppressing drugs and antibiotics to treat Helicobacter pylori, a bacterium that causes most peptic ulcers. The review found that, for people who have had a bleeding peptic ulcer caused by Helicobacter pylori, treatment with antibiotics more effectively prevents gastrointestinal re‐bleeding than acid‐suppressing drugs. Antibiotics when Helicobacter pylori infection is present are also cheaper and more convenient than long‐term acid‐suppressing drugs.
