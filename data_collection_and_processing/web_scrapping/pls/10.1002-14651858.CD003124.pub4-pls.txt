Acetylcysteine and carbocysteine to treat acute upper and lower respiratory tract infections in children without chronic broncho‐pulmonary disease 
Acetylcysteine and carbocysteine are the most commonly prescribed drugs which aim to change the structure of bronchial secretions. This systematic review assessed their efficacy and safety for treating acute upper and lower respiratory tract infections in children without chronic broncho‐pulmonary disease. We also looked in particular at patients younger than two years of age. 
Forty‐nine trials met the inclusion criteria. Six trials involving 497 participants were included to study efficacy, and compared acetylcysteine or carbocysteine to placebo. Thirty‐four trials (including the previous six) were eligible to study safety and involved 2064 paediatric patients. 
The results of this review suggest actual but limited efficacy of acetylcysteine and carbocysteine (e.g. reduction of cough at day seven) and good overall safety (except for rare mild gastrointestinal side effects) among children older than two years of age. However, the number of participants included was limited and the methodological quality was questionable. These results should also take into consideration the fact that acetylcysteine and carbocysteine are prescribed for self limiting diseases (for example, acute cough, bronchitis). In children younger than two years, and given strong concerns about safety (increased instead of decreased bronchial secretions), these drugs should only be used for acute upper and lower respiratory tract infections in the context of a randomised controlled trial.
