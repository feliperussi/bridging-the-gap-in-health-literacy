Heparin for prolonging peripheral intravenous catheter use in neonates
Heparin in intravenous fluids may reduce IV tube changes needed for newborn babies in neonatal intensive care, but more research is needed to determine its safety. Babies in neonatal intensive care often need fluids intravenously (through a tube inserted into a vein). Sometimes the intravenous (IV) tube becomes blocked, as the blood clots and skin becomes swollen. Bacteria can also enter and cause serious infection. Regularly changing the tube (and which vein is used) can reduce some problems, but babies have few usable veins. The drug heparin used in the IV fluids could reduce blockages by thinning the blood, but it can have serious adverse effects. The review of trials found that more research is needed to determine whether heparin in IV fluids is advantageous for neonates without causing side effects.
