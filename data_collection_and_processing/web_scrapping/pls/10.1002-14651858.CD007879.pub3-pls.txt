Hepatitis B vaccination during pregnancy for preventing infant infection
Hepatitis B is an infection caused by the hepatitis B virus and occurs worldwide. For infants and children, the two main sources of the infection are transmission from an infected mother or living in an infected household. Perinatal transmission is common in highly endemic areas. Hepatitis B vaccines are available and require a series of three doses over six months. The most common side effects are pain at the vaccination site and mild to moderate fever. Maternal hepatitis B vaccine immunization may be a way of preventing hepatitis B infection in infants before hepatitis B vaccine can be administered and provide protection to the infant. Infected hepatitis B virus infants are more likely to develop complications such as chronic infection, cirrhosis or liver cancer (hepatocellular carcinoma). This review found no evidence from randomized controlled trials regarding the effects of hepatitis B vaccine for preventing infant infection.
