Pressurised metered dose inhalers versus all other hand‐held inhaler devices to deliver beta‐2 agonist bronchodilators for non‐acute asthma 
This review determined to look at whether fast acting relievers performed better when they were delivered via different inhalers in people with asthma. The authors did not find differences between the devices in lung function measurements that exceeded what would be expected with the play of chance. HFA‐metered dose inhalers reduced the requirement for oral steroids. However, the studies reported data in ways that prevented formal statistical combination. More research is required to establish more reliably whether the devices commonly used to deliver reliever medication provide similar efficacy and safety.
