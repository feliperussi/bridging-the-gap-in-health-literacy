Elective birth of women with an uncomplicated twin pregnancy from 37 weeks' gestation
The optimal timing of birth for women with a twin pregnancy is uncertain, with clinical support for both elective delivery at 37 weeks' gestation (either by induction of labour or caesarean birth), and for waiting for labour to start spontaneously (expectant management). 
Two randomised controlled trials were included in this review involving a total of 271 women with twin pregnancies at 37 weeks' gestation. One of the two trials (involving 235 women) was of high quality, and the quality of the second trial (involving 36 women) was unclear. There were no differences shown between the group of women who had an elective birth at 37 weeks' gestation and the group of women who waited for labour to start spontaneously for the outcomes: birth by caesarean section, perinatal (fetal or neonatal) death or serious perinatal morbidity, or maternal death or serious maternal morbidity. No other differences between the two groups of women were shown for other pregnancy and birth complications or for complications for the infant. 
Elective birth at 37 weeks' gestation compared with ongoing expectant management for women with uncomplicated twin pregnancies does not appear be associated with an increased risk of harms.
