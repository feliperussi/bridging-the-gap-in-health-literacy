Uncertainty about usefulness of antiviral drugs in Ramsay Hunt syndrome
It seems logical that antiviral drugs might help patients with a herpes virus infection of the ear producing facial weakness (a condition known as 'Ramsay Hunt syndrome'). These drugs often help similar viral infections elsewhere in the body. However, trials that might address this issue have not been done and there is therefore some uncertainty about their usefulness. Since patients can experience side‚Äêeffects when taking these drugs, the risks of these have to be balanced with the unknown prospect of benefit when considering whether to use them in Ramsay Hunt syndrome.
