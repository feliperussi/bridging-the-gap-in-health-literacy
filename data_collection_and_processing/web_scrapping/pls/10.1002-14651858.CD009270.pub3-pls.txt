Cannabinoids for epilepsy
Epilepsy is a disorder of recurrent unprovoked seizures. More than half of seizures can be controlled by anti‚Äêepileptic medications. For the remaining patients, they may wish to try other agents to obtain better control. Marijuana, or cannabinoids, may be one such agent. This review assessed the efficacy of marijuana, or cannabinoids, as a treatment for epilepsy. No reliable conclusions can be drawn at present regarding the efficacy of cannabinoids as a treatment for epilepsy. Further trials are needed.
